it as thereare things that i wouldn't dolike umuh our our cash balancei wouldn't go invest that in crypto uhnot because i wouldn't invest my ownmoney in crypto but because i don'tthink people buy an apple stockto get exposure to cryptoand so if they want to do that they canthey can uhuhyou know invest directly in crypto orthrough other meansuh and so i wouldn't do thatand i'm i'm not planning to in theimmediate future to take crypto for ourproductsas a as a mean of tender uh but thereare other things that we're definitelylooking at like whatuh like i wouldn't want tohave anything to announce todaywell let me ask you a different questionbecause you just said that you might notdo it personallydo you own crypto in any bitcoin orethereum would you play around with thisi i do yeah i think it's reasonable toown it as a as a part of a diversifiedportfolio and i'm not giving anybodyinvestment advice by the wayso[Music]happy bitcoin tuesday freaks it's yourboy matt o'dell here for

an episodeuh have a conversation herewhere it's all encompassing from startto finish new new bitcoin are cominginto the space trying to do things youknow the right way trying to do thingsin a secure wayumand and just have it all in a singleepisode have it all in a singleconversationso as i was saying earlier the writerdies that are in the live chat um if youhave questions put your questions in ifif you're not a beginner and you'relistening in and you think we missedsomethinguh feel free to put that in the livechat as well and just a reminder thelive chat is accessible through thetwitter twitch and youtube streams andthey all getfed into uh the main chat so with allthat said i'd like to introduce bitcoinq a how's it going bitcoin q ahey matt it's going good thank you forhaving me back on uh it's been a while ithink um episode number two was now withthat with ergo so uh yeah lookingforward to getting back to it and uhrunning through some some of thebeginner-focused uh stuff that seems tobe missing from some of the podcasts uhfloating around me to tend to get jumpinto the weeds pretty quickly sometimesdon't we yeah i mean i have a feeling weare going to also be jumping into theweeds but we're going to try and do itin a nice constructive path into theweedsyeah i need you to keep me uh keep me incheck on that onebut yeah you are a dispatch lg it hasbeen it's been a minute and uh we'vewe've both been through a loti like to see like to think that we'vebeen through it together and uh yeahjust uhlove that you're back joining us and youknow i hope it's you know not just thesecond time it'll be many more times inthe futureumso with all that said freaks uh we havea bit of a structure that we set up forthis episode which is unusual fordispatch but i think it'll keep usmore focused um and so we're going tostart withactuallygetting bitcoin for the first timeum so do you want to you want to startwith that bitcoin q ayeah so uh it's buying bitcoinsnever been easier than it is todaythere's uh exchanges popping up all overthe place every every man in this dogseems to beuh giving you the opportunity to to beable to buy bitcoin from within theirecosystem or their appumthe the kind of elephant in the roomunfortunately and uh is is the um knowyour customer or kyc is it's uh it'slovingly called within the spaceumkyc is a regulation that essentially anysort of businessentity that has a banking relationshiphas to abide by that kind of dictates umthat they must collect certain pieces ofinformation from anybody that they givea service to obviouslyin the context of bitcoin that's anexchange that sells you bitcoin fordollars pounds yen whatever yourjurisdiction isumso in practice that looks like if youlike go on the cash app and you try andsign up to cash app to buy bitcointhey require you to upload your id youraddressuh i'm not sure some some servicesrequire like a selfie um that's whatwe're talking about right here which isthis identification information that'srequired when you sign up to one ofthese regulated servicesright and some of these are some ofthese exchanges now are even doing uhvideos where you they take that like a3d scan of your face which is kind ofscary really andso with all that said why why is thatkind of um why is that sort of a badthing that that people like matt andmyself sort of try andumwarm people away from or at least paintthe dangers clearly for everybodyeverybody um so when you supply thisinformation to to be able to buy bitcoinin a you know a really sort of easy andstress free way you know cash apps agood example where you can just in acouple of clicks get some bitcoin into awallet that you controlbut one of the main problems is that youknow all of this information getsrounded up into a centralized databasethat's controlled bythe entity that you're doing businesswithum unfortunately these entities or someof these entities they won't toureverybody with the same brush um don'thave a great track record of uh securingit effectively umtalk about perfect timing we we heardabout um a hack with uh robin hoodyesterday was it it was seven millionusersseven million users uminformation has been leaked um nowthere's varying degrees of the severityof the leak some of it's just emailaddresses uh some of it's more personalinformation like banking details etcumyou know to name a few others equifaxfacebook t-mobile clubhouse linkedinuh coinbase ledger um all of thosecompanies umrequiresome form ofof your personal information to to dobusiness with them and and they've allhad hacks where again with varyingdegrees of severity that um somebodythat shouldn't have got their hands onyour information did so i'm you knowwhat we're not talking small fry heresome of these uh hacks were in to thetune of millions and millions of ofpeopleum now you know if that's something likefacebook and your uh email address getsleaked you know it's not really the endof the world it might piss you off alittle bitwhen you tie that into umsomething like bitcoin wherehopefully especially after you'velistened to this podcast and you're sortof securing your own wealth that mightbe uh in your house that might be in aloved one's house or a combination ofthoseif uh if if the wrong person was to gethold of this information you know yourselfie your home addressum indicate in the case of coinbase howmuch bitcoin you've actually boughtthat is umessentially painting a very large crosson your front door that ummight make it inviting to the wrong typeof people to come and pay you a visit tosee if they can relieve you of of thosesatsso that's one of the main umyou knowuh reasons that that i personally tryand sort of make people aware that yesgoing on to cash app or coinbase orwhatever is is you know they make itreally really simple they've got reallynice polished uis to to be able to goand umget some get your hands on some statswithin it within a couple of clicks umit'syou know one of the big big risks isthat this information is leaked on aregular basis and there are companies inspace that to their credit and haveyou know they've nev never umbeen fallen prey to one of these attacksand but unfortunately they do seem to becoming um more and more uh frequent umso yeahthat's one of the main risks with kyc soyeah i mean i would add a couple thingshere uh first of all even if you know acompany hasn't been compromised yet weshould basically operate under theassumption that they will be compromisedin the futureumthis information once it is taken isoften soldto other people as wellit can be combined with otherinformation that was leaked from otherdatabases so for instanceumif you know you you have the facebookleak and the facebook leak has yourmailing address in it and then you havethe ledger leak and your ledger leak hasyour email address in it but thefacebook link also had your emailaddress in it they can combine those twouh leaks to get your full email addressand your actual in-person addresssecond of all we've seen umwe've seen physical attacks happen topeople who were known bitcoiners and howmuch bitcoin they had uh sometimes itwas because of these leaks it's hard totell for sure sometimes it's becausepeople just talk about their bitcoin andhow much bitcoin they own which you alsoshouldn't doumthird of alluhthis information can obviously be usedagainst you by your own government itcan also be used against you by foreigngovernments in the future obviously itis painting a target as you are someonewho owns bitcoin and uses bitcoin andexactly how much bitcoin you haveuh and then fourth of all in thecoinbase league specificallyumall of your withdrawal history was alsoleaked so uh it can be used to trackyour future bitcoin transactions uhbased on that information and we will gofurther in onon bitcoin privacy and trade-offs ofbitcoin when using bitcoin trying to useit privately how to go about that inlater on in this episode but these arejust things to keep in mindright so you know all of which is issort of incredibly scary um and theother thing final thing odds aboutbefore we sort of look onto thealternatives is that you know umsomething that i like to sort of keep inmind and remind people is you knowbeing here for number go up is great youknow i'm not going to sit here and saythat um i don't like to see us hitall-time highs all the time um butbitcoin is also umcreated to be able to make thetransactions that they don't want you tomakenowif you're sort of uh tying all of yourbitcoin to your personal identity umyou're you're kind of putting a inyour armor before you've even startedthat you know if you do want to makethose purchases that umbitcoin allows you to make um due to itspseudonymity thenyou're sort of starting two steps backby tying your your bitcoin holdings toyour personal identity um which is wheresort of buying from a new kyc source itcomes in so that you can have umsome or hopefully you know in a perfectsituation all of the bitcoin that youownso before we get there before we getthere just one more thingkycthese records are forever once once youdo these records you have to assumethey're foreverum is it best practice to delete anaccountum i you know if you're no longer usingit yes but you should assume that actualdatabase record hasn't been deleted umand it might be used against you in thefuture um so these are things to keep inmind umnow let's move to okay so if you'retrying to avoid kyc you don't want touse one of these regulated services whatare your optionsright so the the sort of uh two mostcommon ones that kind of get bannedaround in terms of actually purchasingbitcoin um is bisque uh which is apeer-to-peer uh decentralized exchangewhere you essentially it's a maker takermodel where somebody will want to umsell some bitcoin and they will go on tobisque and they'll say you know i wantto sell uh x amount of bitcoin for thismuch um you know 500 whatever and andthen you as a buyer can go on to thatsort of uh peer-to-peer marketplace andand look for these offers to see onethat sort of fits your bill that youknow was is within your price range andyou know the amount that you want to buyyou can go on completely and honestanonymously and and sort of take theirtheir sell offer so that you can buythat amount of bitcoin from themumthis isbisqyep so it's an application that you justdownload onto your computer basicallyyou run it all locally uh you knowthere's no personal information youdon't need to show any id's to sign upthe only person again depending on thepayment method that you use you knowthere's many many payment methods umsome are better from a privacyperspective than others and but let'ssay you knowmost people are going to go on and andif they want to sort of be able to takea wider range of offers from you knowmore people across the world they'regoing to want to use the banking systemwhich you know might ring some alarmbells to some other people listening butumwhat also i say is what's worse issharing your banking information withone person who is very likely to wantvery likely to be a privacy preservingindividual because they you know theyprobably wouldn't be using bisqueotherwise versus uh the regulatedentities that throw all of yourinformation into a centralized honey potthat we've just explainedum so that's one way you know some ofthe more private options that areavailable on bisc umare sort of postal money orders whichyou know i don't really know great dealabout um because it's a u.s centricthing um but you've also got cash in themailand then there's various various otheroptions that are kind of uh relevant totheir sort of jurisdictionsumanother option as well is huddle huddlewhich worksquite similarly to the way i've justdescribed with bisc and the thedifference being is a huddle huddle iskind of a centralized company um thathosts uh the sort of buy and sell uhlocations for you you know it's awebsite huddlehuddle.comum where you can go and sort of makeoffers or you can take offers again inthe same fashion umso so there may be some uh other alarmbells are in game where thinking whereum well what happens if i go on tobiscor to huddle hollow um and i youknow take this buy offer and i sendsomebody some some you know us dollarsand what's to stop them from just neversending me the bitcoin so both of theseservices um work on what's called anescrow system where the seller will haveto deposit the bitcoin first into amulti-sig wallet that is controlled byum by the buyer the seller and the sortof centralized entity um so thatbasically they theyuh can't sort of run off uh once they'veyou know got hold of your dollarsbecause they have to deposit the bitcoinfirst and and you'll be notified to waituntil you send any of the payments sothat they've proved that they've sort ofdepositedthe bitcoin into that um there is stillsome risk there but it's a reduced riskyeah absolutely you knowit's kind of i would say it's more of agrief and attack than ayou're not really at risk of losingfunds it's more of a um going throughthe arbitration process to prove thatyou've sent the dollars so that you getthe bitcoin back in the end so it'sgonna be more of a headache more than arisk to to actually lose any uhany cash would you sayyeah more or less umsoyeahcontinue so some of the other options umif youuh you can buy from bitcoin atmsthere's a really great website calledcoinatm radar.comwhere you can go on and punch punchingyour physical location i would recommenddoing sousing a vpnand and it will tell you all of thebitcoin etms thatare in your local area the the generalpremise of these is that you uh walk upyou can deposit some cashuh give it a um bitcoin address uhhopefully from a wallet that you controlwhich we're going to come on to laterand the bitcoin will be depositeddirectly into that wallet that youcontroluh there are again as is always the casewith bitcoins from caveats um justbecause you're depositing cash doesn'timmediately make bitcoin atm superprivate depending on the umthe brand of atm machine that you usesome of them do still ask for id um butthat is uh distinguished on the websitei've just said which is callingatmradar.comright some ask for id and thenand then some ask for just a phonenumber some ask for bothyeah which and obviously the the onesthat just ask for the phone number arethe better ones because you can spoofthat with services like textverified.comwhere you can just get kind of a burnernumber uh to satisfy the atm's umuh you know phone number requirementsbut obviously that's not tied to to yourpersonal identityum and then before we continue before wecontinue since we're still like early inthe episode and i should have mentionedin the beginning uh bitcoin q a has uhmy favorite guides in the space so ifyou want to look up somethingspecifically or if you prefer readingum if you go to bitcoiner.guidehe has all of his guides listed there sojust keep that in mind okay continueyeah pretty much everything that we'retalking about i've got some uhsome form of information on it um soyeah moving on to other noko i seeopportunities um so we've covered uhpeer-to-peer peer-to-peer exchangeswe've covered atms and the the next sortof option is to uh is to earn it umwhich might sound a bit outlandish tosome people are new and entering thespace but also we'll say is thatumeverybody has some form of a uniqueskill um and there's always going to besomebody who needs umwhat you can offer them uh it's justabout sort of uh trying to build up abit of a reputation whether that's inyour local area or online and so thatyou canyou knowsell your time or your skills andknowledge um and receive satsin in in repayment for themand the other option again probably notas much of a beginner optionas i would like it to be but the otheroption is to mine itumalthough home mining does seem to begoing through somewhat of a renaissancewhich is really really great to see andso the the general premise of that isthat you canbuy a bitcoin miner you can plug thatinto your um outlet at home plug in anethernet port connect up to to a miningpool and stream yourself somesecret sats or some private no kyc satsuh directly again into your wallet thatyou control umthere's been you know a fair bit of foodbanded around that home mining is iskind oftoo difficult or it's too expensive umthe the thing i would say is that yeahit's very much dependent on yourelectricity prices um but again you knowthis this shows fairly us centric andthere's a lot of places in the u.s whereyou know and if you'reum earning anywhere less than i thinkyou knownails in the chat they'll probablycorrect me on this but i think you'reprofitable mine at the moment anywherebelow 30 sats 30 shots yeah so i meanwith with all of these techniques youmight be spending a little bit moremoney than you would beum if you went through one of theseregulated services um you'rethe way i justify it is i mean you'reyou're paying a little bit of a premiumfor privacyand you're paying that for privacy goingforward too so it keeps paying dividendsuh with mining specifically mining homemining is a fantastic wayuh in my opinion ofaccumulating kyc free setsumit's really nice because once you haveit plugged in it's just constantly goingyou don't even have to really thinkabout it just constantly bringing inmore sets um we already have two wholemining umcivil dispatches so if you go back ifyou go to civildispatch.comor if you go through the podcast feed orif you go to bitcointv.com and ourplaylist over there you can find thoseepisodes and we're about to have a thirdone too uhi think november 30th there's gonna be athird home mining episode so if that'ssomething that interests you you shouldgo check those out uh starting with thefirst one uh because we literally spentlike three hours on all the differenttrade-offs thereyeah just to come back on on somethingthat you said about um generallyspeaking you're absolutely right thatyou're gonna pay uma little bit more for uh noko ac satsyou know especially if you go to thepeer-to-peer exchangesum but i just i like to try and reframeit and you know it's not a a no kycpremium and the theprice that you see on a kyc exchange ilike to call it the um the discount thatyou get given um for giving up yourpersonal information and puttingyourself uh a little bit more at riskthan versus uh getting some sats thatare not tied to your identity so i thinkthat's like that useful framing yeah thereal price is the private way and thenexactly discount if you sacrifice yourprivacyum and then one method that you didn'tmention which isprobably the most uh accessible to newcoinersis if you have a friend or a couplefriends that are interested in bitcoinand they've been in bitcoin for a whileum obviously if you can if you can paythem cash for some of their bitcoinum that is the most private uhi wouldn't say the most private but it'sdefinitely the most accessible privateway for a new coinerand if they if they don't want to sellyou any they might know someone whowants to sell some soum that's always something to keep inmind cashin person isextremely gives you very good privacyguarantees periodumwhat else also like if you knowto the to the bitcoiners out therelistening to this uh showum you know guide your new cornerfriends in throughthat kind of method right and whether ornot you want to actually explicitly sellit to them that's one thing butyou know if you if you go out to dinnerhave them pay for dinner with their withtheir cash or their credit card and thenpay them back in bitcoin orgive them you know birthday gifts inbitcoin and like get them started in apeer-to-peer fashion rather than justthrowing them to the wolves and sendingthem to a regulated exchangeyeah there's a couple of people in thechat that have just uh rightfullyshouted out um as techo vouchers as welland which is essentially uh you'll getsort of stores uh that sort of sign upto become an azteco um sort of vendorand you can go in hand over some cashand you'll get sort of a voucher whereyou can go and claim the the equivalentamount of sats from that again directlyinto a wallet that you controlthe the the other caveat the sorry theonly caveat with azteco is that thethe sort of uh kyc responsibility if anyis put onto the specific vendor so itwon't just be you know don't justpresume that because there's an articleum vendor near you that it won't be nokyc uh each one is sort ofuh left to kind ofcome up with the their owninterpretation of whether they need todo it or not basicallyand you have that major chain in you inthe uk that's an azteca vendor rightwhat's the name of thatit was poundland but then it stopped acouple of months ago and it's showing nosigns of coming back unfortunately uhokay so as they realized what was goingon they're like ah we can't too muchliabilitywhich was a shame because they they havea store in literally every town therewas hundreds of them and it was massivefor the uk but yeah unfortunate to knowmore okay well that's a shame um if youwant toread more aboutthe dangers of kyc you can go to bitcoinq a's website no kyc only dot comumhowever you decide to proceed withobtaining bitcoin and accumulatingbitcoinum the next step istrying to secure it uhsecure it well and secure it in a waythat you don't have to trust a thirdparty uh who can seize your fundsum so how shouldhow should bitcoiners how should newcoiners go about that bitcoin q awhat are their optionsthe natural uh first step for mostpeople unfortunately like we've justsaid is is um a centralized exchangeagain like coinbase cash app or someonesomething like thatwhere you will go on deposit dollars oryour local currency they will uh sort ofcredit your account with you know theequivalent amount of statswhat you have there is um an iouwhere you've got an account with themwhere they say that you've got this muchbitcoin essentially what you actuallyhave in real terms is uh well it's aniou and you don't actually hold anybitcointhe the sort of uh very essence ofbitcoin is the uh that you know thatgoes to say you're not your keys notyour coins which is banded around a hellof a lot and for good reason and itessentially means that if you're notholding the keys for your bitcoin uh youdon't actually have any bitcoinso you bought someone in exchange um thethe next step would be to get yourselfum a mobile walletwhere you can uh generate the keys uhwithin that wallet um so that your youand only you are in control of uh any ofthe bitcoin that you send to that walletum so before we before we move on andi'm sorry that i keep cutting you off ii hope i hope it's uh fine with youbefore you move on umso so the risk is if you're holding itif you're holding it in one of thesecustodial wallets which is what theexchanges default toum and there's some other services thatalso are custodial walletsumbasically the telltale sign of that isthe way you access it is through ausername and passwordumyou don't have any backup yourself whathappens there is there's a highlikelihood that your account could getfrozen we've seen that with paypal inthe past with fiat with just us dollarswhere paypal will freeze your accountand you're not able to get your moneyum it could be stolen if the exchangegets compromised or the custodial walletgets compromisedum and obviously you're trusting yourprivacy completely with the custodianbecause they know all of yourtransactions and your current balancesso it's not idealum and you want to learn how to holdbitcoin yourself becauseone of the revolutionary things aboutbitcoin is that you can hold it yourselfin a way thatumsomeone has to physically compromise youuh to to take your bitcoinum soi guess you're about to start withmobile wallets i think mobile walletsare the most accessible way getting awallet on your phone basicallyum to hold your bitcoin for you rightyeah just before i get down to themobile wallet it comes back to the pointi made earlier about censorshipresistant or being able to make thepayments thatum you know you want to make not thatthey give you permission to to make umif you've got to uh ask for permissionfrom an exchange to be able to sendbitcoin to your desired destination umyou know you're asking for permissionand you know that's not why we're herewe want to be able to spend our money towhoever we want whenever we want sofirst step and the easiest step is toget a phone wallet you know they're freethey're easy to access you know you candownload from any popular app store orquite a lot of them offer umdirect downloads so that you canuh download from the the you know thechosen teams umwebsite or or github umthe a lot of people tend to rush in andtry and buy um you know the next besthardware wallet straight away whenthey've just bought sort of 100 ofbitcoin to dip their toes in a littlebitwell if you you know if you're justdipping your toes in to see if thisthing's uh working for you then itdoesn't make any sense to you know goout and buy a hardware wallet and thisis coming for somebody who works for ahardware wallet company um it doesn'tmake any sense to go out rush out andbuy acouple hundred dollars on a hardwarewallet when you own less than that inbitcoin so that's why you already have aperfectly good phone that you carryaround with you it's very easy to spendand receive fromum but the important thing here is thatyou use a reputable mobile walletthere's a lot of scammy mobile walletsdon't just open up the app store andsearch for bitcoin wallet you will get alot of bad options thereyeah the the unfortunately the the top10 um results for that sort of search inmost of the app stores are quite abysmalmy personal recommendations would besamurai wallet if you're an android useruh or blue wallet or if you're an iosuser uh moon wallet is also another onethat i know you're pretty bullish onthat as well yeah both blue wallet andmoon wallet that's with 2us m-u-u-n areavailable on both android and iosumthey'rethey're very easy to use for beginnersuh i i would say they're not veryintimidating umso don't be intimidated you shoulddownload one just try itso the the kind of general premise ofthese and unfortunately i mentioned moonwallet there it's gonna umit's gonna book the trend of what i'mabout to say but the general premise isyou'll download the app from your chosenlocation uh the the app when you set upa new wallet the app will show you alist of 12 or 24 words which is yourmaster secret um you know which is thethe master backup to your to yourbitcoin wallet anybody that gets theirhands on that and be that physically ordigitally um is going to be able to takeall of your fundsso make sure that you write that downand secure it somewhere um safe andthenso moon wallet has a different backupmethod um it'll prompt you and explainhow to back up that butwe will focus on this standard which issomething we call seed words which isthey're basically these wordsit's a phraseand the wallet generates it for you andyou need to keep them secret youabsolutely need to keep them secret soyou don't want to put them on aninternet connected device you put themon you don't want to like save them inyour icloud notes folder you don't wantto take a screenshot and upload it toicloud what you want to do is at thebare minimum you want to write it downon a piece of paper double check thatyou wrote it down correctly store itsomewhere securely because if someonegets access to it they have access toyour funds but as long as you have thosewordsyour phone you could drop your phone inthe toilet it could fall you know itcould fall and crack and break or justcompletely justyou know some phones just like stopworking sometimesas long as you have those seed words youcan reinstall the app on a new deviceand just put in those words put in thatphrase words and you will have access toyour fundsyeah and the beauty of that is like yousaid most of the you know 99 of thewallets umin the space all sort of work to thatsame standard so you know you wouldn'tnecessarily have to even uhdownload the exact same mobile wallet aslong as the mobile wallet that youchoose umit abides by the rules which again mostof them do then you can sort of put thatseed phrase into into any other walletand there's a quick question in the chatwhich i think is probably good to touchon before we move on to hardware walletsandsomebody asked how much would you needto own to get a hardware walletnow obviously i'm not going to be ableto answer that for the for everybodythat that's watching you know it's quitean individual questionand all i would say is you knowif it's yourthe only mobile wallet you've gottenit's on your daily phone i would use theequivalent of how much cash would youphysical cash would you carry aroundwith you um you know what's your limitat which it's gonna start um affectingyour life if you used to lose thatbalance umthe quick review the mobile wallet themobile wallet should be like almostconsideredis is like your spending wallet what youwould have right inin in your back pocket but uhgoing further when we go into moremethods of storing your bitcoin thatwould be more like a savings accountum except i you're about to say a caveatuh i mean i have my own caveat i wouldsayi thinkespecially if you're using a reputableonei think people can feel a little bitmore comfortable than the kind of amountof cash they would carry in their pocketum i know like i wouldn't feel morecomfortable i wouldn't feel thatcomfortable carrying more than like 400in my pocketum but like a mobile wallet especiallyif it's your first wallet you're justgetting started you're gettingcomfortable you have your seed wordsbacked upuh your phone's up to dateyou know we don't seehacks are theoretically possibleobviously phones get compromised all thetimeumbut i i would probably if i had to picka number i'd like being like the 5 000to 10 000 rangelike that's where you start having toreallyconsider securing it moreum and you should also operate under theassumption because bitcoin tends togo up fastumyou should be prepared ahead of timebecause it could beyou know it could be a thousand dollarsin there and then in six months it couldbe worth eight thousand dollarsyeah the the other thing i would say aswell is that thisalmost everybody has got a spare phonelying around at the house that you knowyou could use that as your sort ofdedicated bitcoin phone and where youcouldbe slightly more comfortable storing youknow maybe larger amountsrelative to the individual and and thenyou could kind of decant off into yoursort of daily phone what you might wantto spend on a day-to-day basisabsolutely nothing wrong with thatapproach as well if you didn't want toand shell out quickly for for umfor a hardware wallet which we can wecan come on to now and so hardwarewallet is well before we get to hardwarewallets you also havethere's also software wallets on on thecomputer that you can haveright so you have mobile wallets youhave software wallets on your computerwhere it's like you install an app onyour computerumi i mean i would saylike unless you're an advanced user andyou have like a dedicated computer andthis episode isn't for advanced usersthey should probably shy away from thatin the beginning i i think the mobilesecurity model is a stronger securitymodel as you know as long as you're notworried about like the nsa or somethingum or like the chinese intelligenceservicesor these intelligence services um mostmost of the population uh are not greatat securing their their computer uh mostpeople's computers are unless you'resort ofa bit of a hacker man there's this youknow a far more vulnerable device thanyour mobile phone iswhich is why like you said you know icompletely agree that i don't recommendthem especially for larger amounts umand i tend to sort of skip straight tothe hardware wallet after the mobilewallet stageumsohardware wallets um are essentially adedicated uh physical deviceum designed to manage the the keys thatcontrol your bitcoin um so with thembeing a a physical dedicated device youknow their one purpose is to secure yourbitcoin whereas your phone hasyou know it's essentially a computer inyour pocket and with all of that extrafunctionality that your phone hascompared to a hardware walletincreases the theoretical attack vectorswhere hackers orthe nsa whoever can umsort of try and attempt to get theirhands on your bitcoin so these devicesare very focused andthey're focused at securing your bitcoinfrom physical attack um and also uh fromum digital attack ie uh you knowsomebody stealing your keys um over theinternet if you were to connect one ofthese devices to your uhvery likely highly insecure computerumso they a lot of them most of the goodones um work uh you know that theirprimary umway of of sort of keeping things secureis that they operate with what's knownas an air gap where they they canoperate without being connectedphysically to to any other device andbecauseit's that physical umconnection that sometimes can introduceuh uh intro um extrathreat factors so the the idea just todistill it here like the idea of ahardware wallet is that you have aa device that's builtto securely hold your bitcoin welltechnically it's holding the keys toyour bitcoinum butfor all intents and purposes it's it'syou can think of it as holding yourbitcoin and and it interacts with eitheryour computer or your phone in a waythat those keysall the keys are what protect yourbitcoin gives you access to bitcoin andyou don't want someone else to haveaccess to those keys it keeps those keysoff that computer or off that phone soit stays on the deviceand that device is never connected tothe internet sothethe basic concept behind securingyour stash with a hardware wallet isthatuh for someone to compromise you theyneed to physically have access to youand the device orif they can compromise the device justthe device but they like have to comeinto your home or come into your officeand get that device rather than hackingyou through the internetright and you know the even um if ageneric attacker was togain physical access to to most of thesedevices and they're still going to um afair bit of time and a hell of a lot ofequipment to be able to um you knowcrack theum protections on the device to be abletoaccess the keys um and to be able tosteal your bitcoin so it's not just acase of umprotecting you from a malware infestedcomputer um if somebody was to break inthere's still pin protection on thedevice and so it's not just a case ifyou lose the device um and you loseaccess to your bitcoin again the thepremise that matt spoke about beforeabout writing down your seed words um isexactly the same with a hardware walletuh the differences here is that um thethe when you sort of uh generate thosethose 24 or 12 words and it's done in anoffline environment that's never beenconnected to the internet so that againit just removes that extra threat vectorwhere um you're not connected to anysort ofinternet connected devices so it's justthat extra layer or wrapper of securityperfectumshould wewhat is your favorite hardware walleti saw that one coming a mile offum so full disclosure um i work for a umhardware wallet manufacturer calledfoundation devicesand obvious biases aside i genuinelybelieve that we make the umthe best option for a beginner enteringthe space umit's incredibly secure but also veryeasy to operate uh so i should havenamed the devices called passport andand another great device is the callcard umwhich is probably looks a little bitscarier to the newcomer i would say umbut has some extra features um thatmight bemore beneficial for more advanced usersthat they could sort of leverage sothose would be my two favorites yeah iwould say my favorite is uh cold cardumi've used multiple versions of coldcards i highly recommend them umand then ifwe're not really going to go intocoins here but if youabsolutely need to gamble onother coins in the space rather thanjust bitcoin uh both foundation and coldcard are bitcoin onlyumi mean so i i would say either use aledger or a treasureuh hardware wallet if if you wantcoin support um but even in thatsituation you probably shouldgo with a bitcoin only hardware walletfor your bitcoin and then use the otherones for your coins and just likethe mobile wallets there are lots ofreally bad harder wallets out thereso don't just googlebest hardware wallet because a lot ofinfluencers are paidtopromote them so you'll see youtubevideos with 500 000 views saying to usea horrible hardware wallet soconsider thatyeah what i would say just to back thatup again is that you know likelihood isif you're listening to this that you'reat least aware um ofyou know bitcoin twitter and the peoplethat are umaround and popular on there and most ofthose people have been around for a goodnumber of years and they've probablytried all of these devices so look towhat most most of theirmost of those people are using or atleast recommended and when you're sortof doing your own research to see whichdevice is going to be best for youperfectumwhen they're using their hardware walletthey need to use it with awith software they need to use it withan appso what are your recommendations forwhich apps they should use with theirhardware walletthe best two for meif you want to stay on desktop whichgenerally gives you sort of a little bitmore extra functionality would be numberone be spiral wallet um hands down myfavorite umor if you like a little bit of a sort ofeasier to to operate interface with kindof lessadvanced features spectre desktop isalso a great onetwo great recommendations spectre usedto be my favorite now sparrow's myfavoriteyeah um whichmight uh be a good segue for what we'vegot coming up next uh well before we getthereyou can also useyou can also use both the cold card andthe foundation passport with blue walleton mobile so if youare going through the steps and you gotcomfortable with blue wallet alreadyum because you started with a mobilewallet uh you can then use blue walletwith both of those hardware walletswhich is nice especially i mean i ithink some people listening to thisprobably don't have a computer that'sso a lot of people don't have computersthey just have the computer in theirpocketyeah you know we're heading towards amobile first world aren't we if not ifwe're not already there and blue walletdoesoffer a great interface uh especially uhwith with the with the passport with theqr interfaces uh very very slick andvery easy to wrap your head around as abeginnerawesome okay so you want to go to thenext topicyou said yeah let'slet's hit nodes yeah so i talked aboutum inspector desktop and one of thegreat features about like the desktop isit actually has a built-in bitcoin nodeso uh the next step along your journeyuh hopefully will be to look to run yourown bitcoin nodeum a bitcoin node is you can look at itas your umsort of interface into your into thebitcoin world and it's going to be thatnext step along the sovereignty journeyso that you can and again one of the thebuzz phrases that you hear in the spaceis verify your own transactionsand so when you receive uh any bitcointransactionand that will bebeing passed to you via a whole networkof nodesand the wallet that you choose to usewill be connected to a node now thatnode could be uma centralized node or operated by anexchange uh it could bea node that you don't know who existsthat might actually be a chainsurveillance company or hopefully itcould be your own node that you can runum in your house relatively cheaplynow the benefits of of running your ownnode like i said is you can verify yourown transactions so that you can be surewhen somebody's sending you atransaction and that the transactionabides bythe this sort of rule set umthat the the network that you've chosento join umthat we all agree on uh to put that alittle bit simplea little bit simpler is that you canbe sure that sort of nobody's trying tocheat you and send you some fake bitcoinor a transaction that's not valid and sothat you know you might be selling goodsor services and they might be paying youin bitcoin for thatandand if you weren't verifying your owntransactions they might be able to umsend you um the way i like to frame itis it's using your own note to interactwith the bitcoin network you have to usea node and if you don't use your ownnodeumyou don't have counterfeit detection isis like kind of how i like to view itsomeone can kind of trick youuh into it into thinking you havebitcoin when you don't have bitcoin soyou want to use your own node for thatpurpose and then second of all which ithink is almost more tangible to peoplebecause to be honest uh we haven't seenthat's more of a theoretical attack andwe haven't really seen it play out itcould still play out in the future youshould assume it it will so you want touse your own node for counterfeitdetection but second of all it alsoif you don't use your own node um you'retrusting your privacy with whoever'snode you're using so you want to useyour own node so that you don't have totrusta potential potentially a stranger or acompanywith that that private transactioninformation and balance informationyeah it's about removing trustessentially and and by running your ownnode you're you're putting the trust inthe hardware and or the the softwarethat you are choosing to run uh not theone that's kind of been given to you ifyou're operating with an exchange or acentralized node runner and so there'suma a massive awash of choice and withvarying degrees oftechnical abilitythe the easiest way to get running withyour own nodeis to download a piece of softwarecalled bitcoin corethis is kind of the the sort of uh defacto software built by the the bitcoincore developers uh that is essentially apiece of software that you can in acouple of clicks download onto yourlaptop or desktop and and it will startto download the your own copy of theblockchain so that you can umtransact with the built-in wallet andto just to get started and verify yourown transaction that way that'sabsolutely the easiest way and as itouched on earlier uh spectre desktopactually has umessentially that built in as well justpackaged in a slightly different way foryou and so they're they're absolutelyfree and within a couple of clicksyou'll be on the way to downloading yourown copy of the blockchain and havingyour own node set upthe problem with a setup like that isthat umyou i can't really um generally speakingconnect any mobile wallets to it so ifyou were to want to transact when you'reout and about and you run bitcoin coreon your laptopand you wanted to send the transactionthe likelihood is you're not gonna haveyour laptop with you so you you know youwon't be able to to spend as easily assome of the node options that we'regoing to come up come on to uh in asecond i'll just pause see if matt's gotanything to add thereumyeah so i mean if you're using bitcoincore or if you're using the built-inbitcoin core inspectoruh yeah correct your you can't the mainnegative is you can't use it with themobile wallet the also the othernegative isum your transaction and balance infowill be on your computer so if it'sa computer you use for work or acomputer you use uhto play games or look at porn orsomething like that your social mediahabitit might be easily compromised and thatbecomes a it becomes mostly it becomes aprivacy issueumbecause all your transaction historywill be there and all of your balancehistory will be thereum but also you can't use it with mobilewallets which is a key component as wellyeah so so the next best option um andunfortunately the most expensive optionis what's known as a plug and play nodeso this is where you'll buyessentially a small box from one of thevarious teamsto name a few we've got uh ronin dojowe've got raspi blitz we've got startnine uh umbrell there's loads ofdifferent companies or my nodeno nothere's loads popping up um all withdifferent feature sets but essentiallythey sell your boxuh that you plug in at home you plug itinto your router you plug it into thepower outletand then within a couple of clicksyou're off and running again to to getyour own copy of the blockchain and haveyour no your own node up and runningand before we move on uh civil dispatchuhcivil dispatch 26i had all the major node teams on for aconversation ontheir node projects so if you'reinterested in having one of thesepurpose-built boxes or you a lot ofthose projects that were just namedallow you to actually buy the hardwareseparatelyand then install their software on it umconsider listening to that sill dispatchright so and the the kind of finaloption is the diy approach like matt'sjust touched on where all of theprojects that we just said and we'llhave a parts list you can go away andbuyspend a couple hundred dollars buying ahard drive and a single board computerand a couple of other cablesand build your own node and put your ownsoftware well put the software thatthese teams provideand onto that hardware uh the the endresult is that you get um the same nodewith all the same features um obviouslythe caveat is that you've got to gothrough the process of buying thehardware yourself flashing the softwareand onto a micro sd card uh which mightcause you some you know if you're a lesstechnical user and you're lesscomfortable with taking that approachand that's why the teams offer theplug-and-play note it does sound moreintimidating than it actually isand i would absolutelyso like i encourage new users to gettheir feet wet um also juston thejust to go back a little bit aboutbitcoin core i mean if you're using youcan use you can also use bitcoin core ifyou're running bitcoin core on the samecomputer you're running spectre on or asparrow they both can connect to itumif you do that process you really shouldbe using it on a dedicated computer iknow i like kind of touched on thatearlier when i said you know if you'reusing it for playing games or socialmediait could get compromised easier becauseyou're using it for all these othergeneral purposes you're downloadingsoftware on it that maybe you haven'tverified you definitely haven't verifiedand have no idea what's really runningthereum so if you are going to go thatapproachyou should have a dedicated device youshould consider a dedicated computer adedicated phone that you are using withit um and uhyeah in general dedicated devices areare going to be more secure and moreprivate you'rewhen we when we talk about security andbitcoin land whereyou don't don't let perfect be the enemyof good don't get overwhelmed becauseyour setup's not perfect but at the sametime you're just trying toreduce your threats so that you're notthe lowest hanging fruit most of thetime when we see these hacks it'stargeted at the people that are mostvulnerableyeah and the just to go back to the diyapproach that was outlining umall of these uh different projects thatwe've spoken about have got reallyreally good documentation and quitevibrant communities as well uh ontwitter telegram or their own dedicatedforum and so don't be afraid to you knowgo and have a browser the documentationlike matt said it's not actually asscary as i made it sound um and also youknow go and ask some questions in the inthe telegram chat or in the slack orwhatever you know um chat room that thethe the project has gotum you'll probably find or you'lldefinitely find thatall of these the people that are inthese communities are really welcomingand they've definitely been in yourposition before now and and you knowthey they found uh the thought of thisreally scary a couple of years ago andyou know now they might be runningseveral diy notes so they'll be don't beoff-put by it100um i will echo that sentiment i wouldjust add a slight caveat that there arescammers in these telegram groups andthese chat rooms um they will often tryand impersonateuhpeople that are involved with theproject or other notable figures to tryand get you feel comfortable never nevergive anybody uh your seed words thosesecret backup boards never give themtheir secret backup boardsand you know always be skeptical ifsomeone in one of those groups tries todm you separately and tries to go into aprivate chat you know sometimes it islegit but you need to be extra cautiousin that type of situationyeah and and if somebody does don't beafraid to ask in in the sort of mainroom you know tag the person who youthink might have dmd you and said isthat his issue at the mme exactly butalways uh just act on the the on air onthe side of caution and and keep thatsort of adversarial mindset to think youknow why is this person reaching out tome completely out of the blue after ijust asked my first question enteringthe room100um so all those node projectssupport something called electrum serverand electrum server is a standardumit's it's a standard way to interactwith your own node um you can use thoseelectrum server details and then you canput them into sparrowyou can put them into many of the mobilewallets that we mentioned earlier youcan put them into blue walletwith samurai specificallythey don't use electrum server they usesomething calleddojoand with that pairing is as simple asthere's a qr code and you just scan theqr code with your samurai wallet on yourphone and it'll pair up with your nodeyeah the good thing is with dojo as wellis it's uh implemented in the vastmajority of the the note packages nowthere's there's more that have dojo thatthen don't which is really great to seeindeedshould we hit on the coin joinokay soi i just want you know we're we're anhour inum if you're a newcomer you just listento this hour and you're intimidated as uh don't be intimidated you knowstart with step one where we talkedabout acquiring your bitcoinumthen you know learn how to hold your ownkeys and slowly move through the processdon't you know freak yourself out thatyou know now now i gotta run a node toolike i'm now i'm really intimidated youknow step by step get your feet wet getcomfortable send transactions receivetransactions back up your wallet restoreyour wallet just get comfortable with itget used to it don't it's not somethingto be scared of it's something that youlearn by doingyeah i uh i put a tweet a couple ofweeks ago actually that kind of echoesthat that you know if uh sending atransaction uh makes you feel a littlebit uneasy then you haven't sent enoughtransactions um you can see on screenthere that the mempool is uh you knowit's a little bit busy than what it wasbut a couple of sats per bite is goingto get your transaction confirmed veryquickly and that's going to cost you youknow less than a dollar to send atransaction so we don't have we don'thave that on the list but before we moveon to coin join on chain privacyutxo management we should probablyhow does how does a newcomer choose whatfee to pay they open up their walletthey go to send a transactionumwhat like how do bitcoin transactionfees work i feel like that is somethingwe tend to gloss overyeah we overlooked that one um wellfortunately most of the the good mobilewallets especially the ones that we'veuh mentioned uh on tonight's stream uhwill give you a couple of options uhwhere you canum you'll they'll either have you knowthree options sort of low prioritymedium priority and high priority likeagain like we can see on screen or theremight be a slider where you can manuallyadjust the feeand essentially the the higher that thefee you pay the more likely that uh yourtransaction is going to be uh confirmedor processed quickeruh againa caveat with that one we've got a lotof caveats tonight is that umthe uh some of the estimation the feeestimations umthese wallets all use different sort ofalgorithms as to how they um calculateor estimate the fee that would berequired to get you confirmed in thedisplayed priorityso matt's got on screen here a reallygreatwebsite called mempool.spaceum which can it shows you again the thepriority uh fee selections uh or what itwould adviseand based on uh correct me from wronggame map but based on what's currentlyin the mempool um as well as sort ofhistorical data as well so it's kind ofaalways a really good sort of accuratelook at you know if you want to get yourtransaction processed within the nextblock uh right now it would take anestimate of 13 sats per byte um butagain there's a little caveat here thatthere's still umtransactions with much lower transactionfees umthan 13 sats per byte that will also getget confirmed so it's kind of umit's not an exact science uh i will saythatbut multiple sources is always a goodone if you want to try and uhget it sort of nailed so i mean bitcoinis a run by a companybitcoin is adistributed networkum and so as a result how bitcointransactions workiswe have this chain of transactionsand the transactions are within blockswe call them blocksumroughly every 10 minutes there'll be anew bitcoin block and it will havefinalized transactions included in thatblockuntil you get into a blockyou sit in a waiting list that waitinglistis we call that the mempool we call itamenpool technically every node hastheir own mempoolumbut if your internet connection is solidin most situations those mempools shouldall look the same so when you go tomempool.space you're looking at theirmempool that will look very similar toif you looked at the same thing on yourown node which a lot of these nodeprojects by the way allow you to runmempool.space natively with your ownnodesothebasically you have this like free marketthat's constantly going on where you'redecide wherepeople are choosing which fee they'rewilling to spend and miners are going tousuallyinclude you in a block based on yourorder in that waiting list based on howmuch you want to spendso if it's a transaction between someoneyou trust um and you're willing to waita longer period of time you can pay alower fee if you're sending just toyourself you can pay the lowest fee wecall that's one sap per byte is thelowest fee because you're just sendingit to yourselfum you know if if in some crazysituation where a one sapper by nevergets confirmed ever which we've neverbeen through you can always resend thattransactionso you're gonna want touh choose your transaction fee based onthe urgency you want that transactionfinalized on the networkand most good wallets will basicallygive you a low medium and highyou knowthislow being i can wait medium being likei'm in the middle ground because it'smedium and high being i don't want towait i want it finalized as soon aspossibleyeah andit'sit's a very much a dynamic thing it'slike a queue that's always evolvingevery single second because there's moreand more transactions being sent youknow every second andumit's not within you know outside therealms of possibility thatwhat the fee that you put up right thissecondmight not be enough to get youimmediately uh processed into the nextblock in sort of five minutes timeum so it's it's very very dynamic andyou know that's why i said it's not sortof an exact science so generallyspeaking for most people the walletestimators are pretty good especially ifit's an urgent transaction that you needto be processedimmediately100 i'm glad we covered that topicum also uhjust uh before we move on to the nexttopic just to jump backwith hardware wallets uhyou know the backup to that hardwarewallet are those words you wrote downumyou have the option of putting them intosteel these steel plates are availablemany different vendors offer the steelplatesand the idea there is if you put it intosteel obviously it's going to be waterresistant and fire resistant it's goingto be more sturdy than paperyou might also consider makingduplicates of those seed words andhaving them in different places so likeif your office burns down or your houseburns down it's still in the otherlocationwith the caveat that it meansit could be more likely that someoneelse finds it because it's in morelocations so you need to think aboutthat very carefullyand then third of all with hardwarewallets which i forgot to mentionone thing i like to tell new coinersis it's a good idea to have to buy twoof whatever you decide to buybecause if you have a second oneyou canyou can have the same backup wordsinitialized on both devicesso then if something happens to yourdevice not only do you have the seedwords available those those secretbackup words available to restore yourdevice you also have the second devicethat still has access to your funds soyou're not in a panic situationum so i always i tend to recommend topeople that they should buy two of thesame device whichever they choose umso that they they can have twoinitialize and you can keep those inseparate locations as wellif you wantokay yeah i think that's good adviceso when you're opening up a bitcoinwallet it shows a balanceum a common misconception isthatthat you know you just it shows yourbitcoin balance that's what's in yourwallet but in reality what's in yourwallet is basically a bunch of differentbitcoin transactions that all add up tothat balanceum we call those utxos uhthose those are unspent transactionoutputs utxos is what we call them youcan think of them like bills in yourwallet like maybe your wallet you knowyour cash wallet has50 in it but in reality it has two 20sand a 10and that's how bitcoin wallets work soyou have all these small utxos in therethat add up to your balance and that hasprivacy implicationsbecause ififtwo of those utxos come togetherum in a single transaction they'reobviously linked on this chainuh forever right we call it theblockchain it's this ledger oftransactions they'll be linked togetherbecause they were both spent in the sametransactionso that brings us to this idea of utxomanagementand coin control the idea oftrying tomanage thosebitcoin transactions in a privacy andcost effective way should you want to gointo that a little bityeah definitely um and quick i willstart with the two wallets that we keepmentioning blue wallet and samurai umoffer all the features that i'm justabout to cover that sort of help when itwhen it comes to to utxo managementandinspectoryeah sorry yeah i keep referring tomobile wallets but yeah the all of thedesktop uh the good desktop wallets thatwe've spoken about i've all got utxomanagement features as well um sothere's a couple of facets to it thefirst one is the ability to uh label thethe utxos or the pieces of bitcoin thatyou've got in your wallet so what wouldbe an example of a label might be thatif matt was to pay me for dinner uh orpay me back for dinner um when ireceived that transaction into my walleti could put a label on that to say thatthat's come from martin it was fordinnerum i could then receive my wages from myemployerumand i could put the the relevant labelon that just to know that where theorigin uhof that utxo is fromumso the once i've labeled themwhen i'm making future transactionsand i'mthere's two ways you can make atransaction you can let the wallet toconstruct it for you automatically whichthey might choose any random utxos andmerge them together again like matt saidto which will show common ownership thatmight not be a problem however if you uhwant to preserve your privacy and imight not want my employer to know thati'm friends with matt because he's a badperson um because i've labeled those i'mnot a bad person thoughbecause i play radical[Music]because i've labeled those utxos when ireceived them at the time um in you knowtwo weeks down the line when i'm goingto make a transaction um i can then chyou know consider and the person thati'm paying you know do i want them toknow that i know matt or do i want themto know that i work for the company thatpaid me uh with this utxo i can makethat informed decision then to say wellactually i'm just going to spend fromone of those pieces of bitcoin oractually it's not a bad thing matt's notreally a bad person i'm gonna combinethe two uh because the value that i wantto send i need to combine the twoum so those are the two two sort of mainfacets to it and and but obviously youcan't ummake a an informed decision when youcome to spend um if you don't know theorigins of all of the etxos that you'vegot and so they kind of go hand in handreally um you need to label so that whenyou come to spend you can make theinformed decision as to whether youshould merge or not yeah so a key aspectof bitcoin isif someone sends you bitcointhey can see where that bitcoin goes inthe futureand if you receive bitcoin you can seewhere that bitcoin came from in the pastsothis is why labeling is importantbecause you want to knowwhere that transaction came fromor it goes tobecausethat's who you're exposing your privacyto in that situationis that a good yeah installation yeahwhich you know um might not be a problemfor you know the person that i'm payingmight not um be able toor be clever enough to to use blockchainanalysis um but the other sort of umadversary that we need to consider hereis chain analysis firms that might betrying to umcluster or monitor your unchain activitywho you're spending to who you'regetting change back from uh to monitoryour habits to try and um piece togetherumyou know the identity because theblockchain doesn't have any identitiesat that at the blockchain layer um butthese companies work to kind oftie all the pieces together so that theycan um de-anonymize people and so it'snot just a case of umyou know hiding how much you earn fromyour friend uh it's also you know thesemore sophisticated actors that have gotmore a lot more resources to throw atthis and that you've also got to bear inmind as well unfortunately yeah you bothyou both don't want you don't want youremployer to knowwhat you're spending things onand you don't want the guy who sells youa sandwich to know how much money youmakebut on top of that we also have theseprofessional surveillance mercenariesthat work for governments dictators andcompaniesand they are just out there constantlytrying to track bitcoin transactions soyou also have that as a concernwhich leads us nicely onto coinjoin ithink if unless there's anything elseyou want to touch on no let's yep we cantalk about coinjoin now so coinjoin umis um acoordinated or collaborative transactionwhereyou and at least one other personwillcollaborate to construct the transactionthat casts some doubtas to theorigin and the output of the transactionto umto make suream thatstill could you still hear mei can still hear you yes oh sorry ithought i dropped out yes it's acoinjoin is a collaborative transactionwhere umthe the idea is that theuh somebody watching the blockchainagain chain surveillance firm youremployer your friend whoever they can'tumdeterministically orwith good probability be able to trackthepeople on the input side of thetransaction to the output side of thetransactionso it effectively attempts to put upsort of um a brick wall in your you knowthe the utxos history so that umanybody looking on chain can't be sure100umyou know is there one person involved inthis transaction is there 10 peopleinvolved in this transaction it justcasts doubt on the the uh path that thebitcoin has taken and and who sort of umyou know has the bitcoin change handshasn't it we we're not really sure so sotracking bitcoin is a probability gameumthese surveillance companies and theirtools will basically or just someonewho's curious and trying to spy on youum will basically assign a probabilityto every transaction if ownership haschanged because one of the things aboutbitcoin isyou know i could send bitcoin to myselfor i could send it to bitcoin q a anduh the chain doesn't delineate betweenthat so a key aspect of tracking bitcointransactions isumdetermining some kind of probabilitythat bitcoin actually changed hands andthen from there trying to seewhich hands it went from from who to whoum so coinjoin is this idea of acollaborative transaction and you canthink of it likeumjust for an example if you have fivepeople that are doing a coin jointtogetherinstead of uh having a simple path thatyou're following on chain and decidingif ownership has changed um all of asudden there's five different potentialpaths it could go downyou don't know which of the five peoplethat participatedwhich of their five outputs are themso it breaks that probability chainand it's a useful tool in terms oftrying torecr to have forward privacy have thisidea of someone who sent you bitcoindoesn't necessarily know which path yourbitcoin took going forwardyeah and specifically with umimplementations of coinjoin likewhirlpool which are known as equaloutput coin joints um the the the sortof notion is that everybody um on theoutput side all of the utx on the outputside of the transactionlook absolutely identical and soit's kind of uh i always like to use theanalogy of v for vendetta where you'vegot the million mask marchit's essentially the same thing but onthe blockchain where all of these utxosare indistinguishable from one anotherand so like matt said you've got someforward privacyand be quickand soi the the three major coin jointprojects our samurai whirlpool joinedmarket in wasabiumcitadel dispatch 15 was with the wasabiteam civil dispatch 16was with the join market teamand civil dispatchi don't know where he is i also did asamurai oneum is citadel dispatchit's there in your feed somewhere youknow uhstefan can just rattle them off he knowsexactly which one is which always amazesme that umi don't know which one it is i'll comeback to it and tell you but it's there'sthere's another dispatch with thesamurai team so if you're interested inthis uh consider going back andlistening to those threeumme and bitcoin q auh like samurai whirlpool the best youcan also you you don't have to usesamurai walla with it you can usesparrow wallet with it as wellumyeah yeah co-sign that samurai orsparrow a hands-down win is for me umespecially from a from a beginner'sperspective um definitely the easiestones to get started with in my opinionyou can continue on i'm trying to figureout which dispatchi'lli'll cover off one quick question that'sum quite on topic and somebody askedwhat's the difference betweenum coinjoin that we've just spoken abouton a coin tumbler so the unfortunatelythe words uh or the the meanings havebeen kind of umwhitewashed somewhat over the years butum generally speaking a coin tumbler isa centralized service where you willhave tosend inyour bitcoin and give up a custody of itto whoever's running the tumbler andthey will send you somebody else'sbitcoin backand i absolutely wouldn't recommendanybody use thesebecause you're putting yourselfum completely in the hands of whoever'srunning the tumbler and that you knowwhether they're going to send you yourbitcoin back or notand yeah soand you also not only you're trustingthem with your bitcoin if you use acustodial mixer it's the same ideas ascustodyum because custodial risks with walletsum you're also you're trusting them withyour privacy and your fundsum so the key aspect of coinjoin is isthe idea that you are reducing trust inany kind of centralized third party umwasabi and samurai have a centralizedserver that they doum[Music]that they use to coordinate the coinjoins to make them easier better uxuh and more reliablethose coordinators are blindedwith samurai specifically you can use itwithout your own node and then you'retrusting samurai's node so that goesback to our earlier conversation aboutusing your own node you should use yourown node when you use samuraiotherwise you are trusting them withyour transaction and balance informationas as is the case with all light walletsum i found it so so it's still dispatch15 is wasabi still dispatch 16 is joinedmarket and still dispatch 30 is samuraiso consider listening to thoseokay i think are we done on coinjsshould we move on to the next topic um ihave multisig as the next topic butshould we do lightning real quick firstsure thing yeah yeah i think it's apt umsoquick high level on what the thelightning network is uh it is a scalingsolution for bitcoin that umallows you toum transact with uhactual real bitcoin um but you don't doso with what's known as an on-chainfootprint and so it allows you to sortof lock up a small amount of well asmuch bitcoin as you want onto thissecond layer solution known as thelightning networkso that you can umyou essentially just defer the theoverall settlement um of any number oftransactions from going on chain to toreduce fees and also to allow you totransact um much quickerso whereas uh one on chain transactionyou know might cost you a couple hundredsats depending on the fees and you youmight be able to send you know 10or even 100lightning network um transactions forthe sameuh for the same amount of fees um nowthere is uhunfortunately lots of caveats with thelightning network again in terms ofbeing able to do it properly uh with uhthe best way to do so be with one of theuh no packages that we've spoken aboutbefore andwhich will dictate that you need tomanage your own sort ofyour own channels which is essentiallywhere you lock up this bitcoin to beable to to transact on this second layerumso it's a little bit more of a hurdle toto get on board with um but you you sortof can save yourself a fair bit on feesespecially if we ever see a feast bikeagain um which i think is inevitable umthe i don't knowinevitable um sofirst of all there's been a lot ofdispatches on lightning if you gothrough the feedconsider listening to those there's likea lot of different caveats and nuanceswhen using lightningspecifically with privacy i did a fullprivacy episode with openobs and anthonythat's still dispatch 21 that's onlightning privacyuh so consider checking that out but themain differentiation that you as a newuser should think about with lightningis going back to our transaction feeconversation earlierwhich iswhen you use a regular bitcointransactionyour transaction fee is not based on theamount you send it could be kind ofweird for youuh it's it's actually based on theamount of utxos that you useuh for the transaction it's based on thedata size not the amount of money thatis sentsoyou could end up sending a five dollartransaction with bitcoin on chain aregular bitcoin transaction and it couldcost the same as sendinga five million dollar transactionnow with lightningit's different the way fees arecalculated on lightning is based on theamount you're sending so that'll be morecomparable to something that you're usedto in traditional finance world where ifyou send more money you're going to paya higher fee you send less money you'regoing to pay a lower feenowuh moon wallet with 2us as we talkedabout earlier mobile wallet supportslightningand blue wallet supports lightning nowif you use blue wallet in its defaultstate with lightning it's going to be acustodial walletwhich i don't loveuh if you insist on using it use it witha small amount because they can takeyour funds you are trusting them withyour privacy um ifuhyou can also use blue wallet withsomething called lnd hub which some ofthese node projects offeri think umbral and my node offered idon't know who else offers it but if youuse it with lnd hub or your friend's lndhub then it's not custodial with bluewallet it's custodial with who's everrunning the lnd hub so if you run thelnd hub yourselfthen it's not custodialotherother lightning specific wallets onmobilethat you can use so moon does bothblue wallet does boththen there's lightning specific mobilewallets that are very good uh there'sphoenixwallet uh there's breeze walletumbreeze b-r-e-e-zcontinuing the bitcoin naming scheme ofusing words and spelling themdifferently um is there anotherlightning wallet that i'm missinglightningeclair as well haven't youwell claire is phoenixphoenixyeah why do they have two okay but yeahboth of those are good yeah one allowsyou to manage your own channels and theother one does it for youokay phoenix does it for youyepokay so forget eclair your new corneryou have phoenix and you have breezewallet or you can use moon or bluewallet and that'srather than for savings you should thinkof that more asokay this is like my spending wallet mytransaction fees are based on the amounti send i'm going to be sending smalleramounts umso i i might use lightning rightyeah i agree i'm quite a big fan ofphoenix um especially from a perspectiveof you know one that a wallet thatmanages the channels for you and i mightget a lot of for this in the chatbut i'm i'm a firm believer that mostnew users don't shouldn't strive todive head first into lightning withtheir own channels because it's it'sit's not easy it's not approachable andeverything that we've already discussedum in terms of holding your own keys umuh using coinjoin and and not using kycare far more important than uh strivingto get your own channels up and runningum quickly uh i don't know what youthink about that matt and i'm waitingfor the in the chat no i mean ithink i i i think umlightning on mobile uh with the walletswe just mentioned moon blueum breeze phoenixfor smaller spending amountsuh is very accessibleuh actuallyif you if you actually want to dolightning in a proper sovereign wayum that i would say is a more advancedthing don't get intimidated by it but ii think it's important for ourall-encompassinggetting started guide that we do mentionit it exists and what are the you knowdifferent trade-offs basically thetrade-off there is a little bit you'regetting less security uh you're gettingless reliability with lightning umbut you're getting lower feesfaster transactions all else equalum[Music]and it could be very useful in a mobilespending type of situationyeah i agreephoenix and brees really great ways toto get started with lightning that havesort of their own unique um trade-offsuh that kind of give the the best ofboth worlds from it from a new userperspectivewhen you compare them with umcustodial solutions like the defaultblue wallet or running your own channelsand that's one of theyeah i mean that's one of the reasonswhy i like moon so much like moon with2us has like different tradeoffsum it doesn't have a standardized backupprocessuh it's you know if if you'rea lot of big corners will say it's youknow not a lightning wallet but at theend of the dayit's not a lightning wallet because youstore all your funds on chain you're notstoring it in a proper lightning walletum but what's cool about moon isif you scan a qr code it could be alightning qr code or it could be aregular bitcoin qr code and it justautomaticallyfigures that out for youum and and vice versa yeah so so you canjust have you can have some spendingcash in your moon wall at muunand whatever whatever bitcoin qr codeyou scan it will send but it doesn'thave power user features it doesn't havethat coin selection that we were talkingabout with utxo management it doesn'thave labelingit doesn't have a standard backupprocessso these are all things to keep in mindright multisig multisig let's let's gohere's where we get into the weeds alittle bit um right so you've been inthe weeds for a whileall of the uh wallets that we've spokenabout umthe desktop wallets mobile wallets alloperate umon what we colloquially call a singlesig setup where they have um a singlesecret or backup um which is requiredwhen you want to spend your bitcoin amulti-sig wallet is where you combinetwo or more of theseseparate wallets together to create abrand new walletwhen you set up this multisig wallet youcan dictatethe minimumamount of keys required to be able tomake ato sign or authorize a send transactionso that could betwo from a possible three keys is apopular one all the way up to somethingelaborate like 11 or 15 you know whichmight be uh used in sort of a businesssetting props um but two of three whereyou need two signers from a possiblethree that were created to that we useto create the wallet to sign off on anytransactions from that wallet so whywould you want to do that wellwith a single sig wallet and some of thethree theoretical attack vectors ifsomeone's to someone but somebody was tosteal your deviceand and umwhile you know if they snatch your phonewhile it's out of your hand and you'vegot your wallet unlocked um they cansteal your bitcoin if that was one ofthe keys in a multi-sig wallet where youneeded two to spend from then they can'tsteal anything from youumanother one of the attacks that multisigprotect from is known as a retirementattack where there might be a malicioushardware wallet vendor thatdoesn't publish their source code um andthey umhave some uhmalware baked into into the the into thedevice and that is actually uh has theability to stealyour bitcoin i will say again correct meif i'm wrong game out but that has neverhappened again it's a theoretical attackbut if you were to use um a multi-sigsetup where you've got differenthardware wallet manufacturers if one ofthose is is maliciousum they can't get access to your fundsbecause they don't have you know if it'sjust one key out of two that arerequired they don't have the uhthe minimum number of keys required tosteal anythingall the goodall the good wallets all the goodhardware wallets are open source sotheoretically open source meansthat the code is available for you toverifyum and you can read the code line byline nowif you're a new coiner you're probablyup to this point you're already reallyintimidated you're like matt i can'tread codei'm aware okaysoat the end of the dayit is very good that you're able totechnically verify the code but mostpeople will be updating their hardwarewallets and they will not be verifyingthe code so there is some trust that youare you're trusting that hardware walletmanufacturer to not ship uh maliciouscode to you and you're also trustingthemuh that that the actual device wasn'tcompromised when it was first sent toyou right so with multisig the idea isyou can have multiple but specificallyin a hardware wallet ida hardware wallet multisig the idea isyou can have multiple vendorsuh that aremultiple different hardware wallets thatcome together to form your walletandyou needa combination of them as bitcoin q a wassaying a common one is two of three youneed two of them to spend the fundsthis reduces trust in any specifichardware wallet manufactureryou also have the added benefituh that those backup words instead ofthose backup words being aumone and done situation if someone findsthose secret backup words we call themseed words if someone finds those wordsthey have access to your funds in amulti-sig setup you haveummultiple sets of backup words and theyhave to find the required threshold ofbackup wordsin order to spend your funds so ifyou're using a two of three you're gonnahave three sets of backup words you'regonna have three hardware walletsthose backup boards obviously can be onsteel as we said earlierum and you can have them in differentlocations so bitcoin gives you bitcoinwith multisig gives you this uniquesituationwhere you can have a geographicallydistributeduh security setup where you're holdingyour own coinbutthethe the keys to access it can be locatedin different places they can beduplicated you can keep copies of themin different places and for someone toactually compromise you and take yourfunds they're gonna need to have accessto a combination secretwe lost bitcoin q a about two minutesago or a minute and a half ago and i'mjust gonna keep talking until hereconnectssothat is the main benefit of multisig[Music]do not once again do not get intimidatedhereuhplenty of people store bitcoin in singlesig uh setups it is thenormal way of setting it upum this is something you might graduatetouh multisig ux multisigumi guess ux can be kind of a complicatedwordlike the way you interface with themultisig walletis a relativelynew thing in bitcoinumso it it has a little bit more of alearning curve it is a little bit morerough around the edgessoyou want to get really comfortable withit as i said earlier you want to bebacking up restoring spending receivinggetting comfortable with it separatelyof your single sig setupnow one cool aspect of multisigis that you canactually have a single sig walletuh so you can be using a hardware walletthat is single sig and then you cantake that single sig and you canactually also use it in a multi-sigenvironmentandit can be one signer of for instance thetwo of three in the multi-sig but alsoit could also be its separate walletum andi guess the main advantage thereumi guess there's two main advantagesthere first of all if someone findsyour single sigback up your your secret words uh itmight have some small amount of funds onit and they think that's all your fundsthey they can't tell that it's in amulti-sig setupumso they might just take that funds andthink they took all your bitcoin umthis thesecondary benefit isthat you know you can repurpose thesethese hardware wallets and use them formultiple wallets now one other caveathere is with multi-sig you do want toback up additional information besidesjust your seed wordsumbitcoin q a came in and then left againso i will continueumthe popular multi-sig softwaresparrowspectre supports it blue wallet supportsitthey will tell you what you need to backup and make sure you save all thatinformation now that informationthat additional information that's notyour seed words umthey will have terms like derivationpathum descriptorthe list of something called x pubs youdon't necessarily have to know what allof that means you just have to save itand you just have to realize thatwhileseed words area security risk if someone gets yourseed wordsthat information that separateinformation that you have to back upwith a multi-stick wallet is a privacyrisk so if someone finds that they cansee how much you're holding in themultisig but they can't necessarilyspend itbut you need that information plus yourbackup boards in order touh to spend your funds bitcoin q are youbacki am apologies for that that'll happen ithink it's my networkno worries at all um i just continued onand i just kept talking about multisigdo you be holding it downumii get i mean i think we arei i think i sufficiently explainedmultisig tradeoffs and and benefitsumshould we move on to mistakes commonmistakesyeah did you cover sort of thealternatives to doing it yourself themultitec approach no i didn't that'sgreat why don't you go into thatyeah so obviously matt's just outlinedsome of the potential pitfalls withdoing it yourself umso one of the other options is known askind of collaborative custodyalternatives where um there will be acentralized service uhsome examples are on chain capital anduh casaumwhere they will help you coordinate amultisit quorum and where they hold oneof the keysand so that in the event that you wereto umso i'll give you an example you'd have akey on your mobile phoneyou'd have a key on a hardware walletand one of theseservices will hold the key as wellso they only have one key so they can'tsteal from you which is greatumbut if you were to lose say your phonewhat their key or the key on yourhardware while and he didn't have itbacked up they will be able to step inas a third party to help you move yourbitcoin so that in a doomsday scenarioand you um you don't lose your lifesavings which is really greatyou will pay for this service and againi'm not sure on how much each charge thebottom tier i think is just over 100umlast time i checked per year and one ofthe the trade-offs with this is that umunless you sign up uh without yourpersonal information which i believe isquite difficult to do umthethese uh centralized um entities thathold the key and part of yourmulti-sitcorum they know who you arethey know how much bitcoin you hold inthat wallet because they hold one of thekeys and they alsohold the sort of uhthe wallet file if you like to put itsimply and so that they canjust as a kyc exchange can umbe able to tie you to your bitcoinidentity so it's worth paying up thetrade-offs yeah and you're using theirnode sothe assumption is if you do this if youuse one of these providersuh you're trusting them with yourprivacy but they will hold your hand andthey will have a spare key for you aswellum and they will help you onboard intothe process they will help you gethardware wallets they will go throughthat whole process but you are trustingthem with your privacy they know yourtransactions they know your balancesandin 99 of situations they know who youare as well uh they'll know the ipaddress of your of your devices that youconnect fromthis is all kind of getting a little bittoo much into the weeds but the key isthat you're trusting them with yourprivacyum i was explaining earlier justbasically doing it yourself so you coulduse your own note and you aren'ttrusting someone in that situation youcan still haveumother people hold keys for you so abitcoin q a started with a two of threesetup because that's a very common setupbut another common setup is a three offive setup and if you do a three of fivesetup you have five total keys and youneed three to spendsoif you need three to spendyou can hold three keys yourself so thatyou know you have and you put them indifferent locations and you know youhave enough to spend it yourself butthen you can also have you know a familymember a frienda lawyerholdhold a key you can have differentcombinations of people hold the key soit can be very useful inum[Music]specifically in in situations whereyou're trying like inheritancesituations where if if you pass away youhave large bitcoin savings uh you knowmaybe a lawyer is holding one in a trustmaybe a couple family members areholding individual ones and theybasically all need to collaboratetogether in order to spend your funds ifyou have three keys with other peopleum but you can also do it in a way whereyou don'tyou don't they never have the thresholdthey need to compromise you pluscombined togetheryeah i think umjust one final thing before we move onto the next topic um inheritance is abig one for me that um i i sort of liketo drive over people who seem to seemkeen to kind of jump into the diyapproaches thatyou know you might have spent some timelistening to some podcasts watching someuh tutorials or reading some guides andfeel comfortable in setting up amultisigumsetup um but what happens if you're notaround tomorrow unexpectedly uh is yourspouse your next kin are they going tobe able to coordinate a spend from a twoor three or a three or five do they knowwhere to find the keys do they know howto recover it and if you answer no toany of those questions then uh all ofyour life savings disappears when youdisappear soand something to bear in mind especiallyif you're going to take the diy approach100 i'd also add that there's a middleground hereuh specifically supported by cold cardcalled seed xor and basically in thatsituation instead of having one seedit's not multisig but instead of havingone seed you have two seeds and you needboth of them in order to spend yourfundsso it's a little bit different thanmulti-sig it can be more accessible topeople uh because you don't have theseadditionalcomplications that we were justdiscussing with multi-sigbut it gives you that benefit of nothaving a single seedbackup wordsthat can be compromised by someonethere's also something that's supportedby pretty much every wallet out therecalled a passphraseand in that situation you have thesebackup boards are usually 12 wordphrases or 24 word phrases thepassphrase is the 13th word or the 25thword and you pick that yourselfso if you do that method then you cankeep the passphrase separate from yourbackup words if someone wants tocompromise you they need access to bothumand i mean if it's a weak passphrasethey might just take your backup boardsand keep trying pass raisesumbut it it adds an additional umburden on them to try and compromise youwithout going through a multi-sig setupum anotherinteresting thing about passphrases isyou can store money on the bear backupwords and then you cannot when you use apasswords it's a separate wallet soin that situation you can actually keepfunds on youryour basic backup boardsand then if someone finds that they'lljust steal those that money and theymight not know you have a passphrasewith the majority of your savings in itum so that's just something to keep inmindawesome do you want to cover off uh somesome common mistakesnext on the listyeah i think common mistakes is a goodspot to go nextuh so i've got quite a lengthy list hereandthe first one of which unfortunately iuhfell fell prey to a little bit um andthat is uh it comes back to our veryfirst pointof cape kycmultiple exchanges and without any realneed to really um so i've just uh sortof expose myself to you know put my nameon loads of different databasesand soit's an unfortunate one that you can'treally undo like we spoke about beforeand if you were to you know listen tothis podcast and decide that youumstill want to gofor a kyc exchange because you think youknow the task of going uh no care adviceandtry and limit your umyour exposure to this by just signing upwith one reputable exchange umi think that's a good one to start anddid youi think that's very good advice like ifyou are going to use a kyc service whereyou're providing your identityinformation you should choose itcarefully you should choose someone youtrust the mostand you shouldnot sign up for a lot of people justsign up for a ton of different servicesyou should only you should sign up forthe bare minimum ideally if you're gonnado it you sign up for oneyou use it solely just to buy bitcoinand then send it to your own walletsumand and you don't you don't use anyother additional kyc services you wantto limit that as much as possiblesecond thing is did you change your micsetup at all because it's way worse nowthan it was beforeuhhello i changed my computer um i'll havea player how much while you're talkingnow turn up is it just quietno we can hear you but it's just likebreaking up a little bit it's likecutting in and outall right i'll let i'll play aroundumanother common mistakeuhthat i see people make isi i mean gambling on coins so a lotof people will think that um bitcoin istoo expensive and i've missed the boatand i i'm too late to bitcoin umliterally every single person who hasentered bitcoin at any time in bitcoinhistory has thought they were too latethere's like a famous screenshot ofsomeone on one of the bitcoin forums uhlamenting that they didn't get in atfive cents and instead they got in at adollar and they were too late and theymissed the busum so everyone feels that wayuh you're not alone in that it'simportant to realize that you cantransact insmaller units of account we call themsatssoyou can you don't have to have a fullbitcoin you don't you don't you don'tneed like right now bitcoins at almost70 thousand dollars you don't need toput 70 000 and to use bitcoin uh satsare the smallest unit of bitcoin there'sa hundred million of themper bitcoin andright now sats you can get 1500 for adollar so you can send any amount ofsats you want to send you can send twodollars worth you can send 25 centsworthumit doesn't matter don't get caught up inin in thinking that bitcoin is tooexpensiveuhwhat common thing that these other coinswill dois they make it so they have so manyunitsthat it seems like it's cheaper than itis just to try and get you in the doorit's a it's a marketing tactic so justkeep that in mind uh q are you thereyeah how's my mic now oh so much betteri'm glad i brought it up perfect okay doyou have more common mistakesuh yeah common one um is just notpracticing umenough with transacting uh testing mybackups for my hardware walletstesting different wallets even usingtest net just practice practice practiceand getting comfortable uh using the thevarious tools that we've spoken aboutandgetting comfortable with it either usingtestnet which is basically uha copy a carbon copy of bitcoin that'shas that holds no value you can get itfor free onwebsites called faucets where you can goon and just mimic the normal behavior ofa walletand without the fear oflosing any real value and so you cansend some test net bitcoin to to your hardware wallet and youcan wipe it recover itand just to get really reallycomfortable with with that process sothatif um the worst was happening and yousomething was to happen to your houseuh where you say bitcoin wherever youstore your coin andyou're when you're in that packed stateit's not like the first time you touchyour hardware wallet for five yearsbecause you you know you've done thatyou know people call practice so you'vegot this lots of time if you send realvalue in there but it'sconnected to you and because you know ifyou're in a panic and you you need tomove your bitcoin quickly the last thingyou might be doing is doing itin unfamiliar uhsituation or in a familiarsituation wherebecause that's when mistakes happen andyou could uh muck something upyeah so we see that happen a lot whereyou know peopleuh so i actually don'tespecially for newcomers i don't know ifyou need to use testnetum it adds just anothercomplication to your processumbut but what happens a lot is likepeople will buy bitcoin they'll send itto a hardware wallet they never reallyuh get comfortable with itthen bitcoin goes up in valuesignificantly and like four years laterthey're trying to spend it and they'rejust not comfortable at allso you really want to get comfortablewith it you want to practice sendingreceiving backing up and restoring umand just you know i don't think testthat's necessary in that situationbecause you should just do it with thesmall amounts you knowuse you know send five dollars back andforthuh erase the wallet restore it from yourbackup see that your five dollars arestill thereum one nice thing about my earlierapproach that i mentioned if having twoof the same hardware walletis without putting funds at risk at allyou can load up one hardware wallet withsome bitcoinand then you can restore iton your second hardware wallet you canload up those secret words onto thathardware wallet and if your funds arethere and you can spend them then youknow you did the backup and restoreprocess correctly without actuallywiping the original wallet so that'sanotherbenefit you're basically verifying yourbackup and restore processyou don't want to be in a situationwhere you have a lot of moneyandyou have a lot of money on the line andyou've never done a backup you've neverhave you've never done a restoredprocess and you're just freaking out andmaybe you wrote down the words wrongi've had that happen to friends wherewe've had to guess the word that theythey wrote down wrong or wrote down inbad handwriting um so you don't youdon't want to be in that situation youwant to practice practice practicei think just to add to that uh backupprocess as well is thatmost of the umor the hardware wallets that we'vetalked about this evening havemultiple different types of backups aswell so i think it's worth noting thatpractice using both of them as well sowe've got the the siege words umboth call card and passport alsoofferingbackups as well where you can store itbackup onto a micro sd card um which is alittle bit easier to store and so iwould urge people to practice restoringfrom both methods as well becauseat the end of the day if again if in adoomsday scenario you don't know whichmethod of backup you're actually goingto have access to or which is survivedwhatever um you know doomsday scenariohas actually happened100um before we move on to more commonmistakes we have alex mccluskey in thechat asking about 401k ira fundsum if you're trying to hold bitcoin in aa in a in a tax beneficial way in yourretirement accounti would just keep this very simple uh ifyou do haveuh a 401k or an ira where you alreadyhave funds in it and you want to movethem into bitcoinjust consider using uh the serviceoffered by unchained capital that'sunchained.com disclosure they are asponsor of ofmy other show rabbit will recap thisshow does not have sponsorsumbut they're a sponsor becausethey're a good team it's a good productumi have friends there that are workingthere my buddy jeff andrew runs theirtheir retirement division and they willhold your handthey will help you through it obviouslyas we said earlier the caveat is you'retrusting them with your privacyum but pretty much in all situationswith retirement funds if you're using atax beneficial retirement uh methodyou're going to have to trust someonebecause it's all getting reported to thegovernment as wellthe nice thing about what unchained doesis you hold your own keys so you getthat tax benefit um but you're holdingyour own keys they can't spend yourfundsa lot of the other programs that are outthereumcan can spend your funds at will and youhave to trust them completely with thesecurity of your funds and your privacyso just something to keep in mindyeah the next one umfrom me is kind of a little bit moreoutside of the box umi lurked around on on bitcoin twitterand in some of the communities uh for alot longer than i really should have umwhen i started to uh interact with withpeople in the you knowwallet chat rooms or the no chat roomsand to use a few examplesmy knowledge grew exponentially fromthen onwards from having thoseinteractions versus me just sitting onthe sidelines and kind of you knowliking a few tweets every now and thenso if i was to go back and kind of havemy time again i i'd absolutely startgetting involved and start contributingand to the conversation much muchearlier because uh personally speakinganywaymy my knowledge just uh you knowskyrocketed compared to where i was justa couple of years ago and so big one forme that oneyeah that's uhand uh i just i think like learn bydoing right practice with small amountsumand get your feet wet rather than feelintimidated and feel like you have toread everything and listen to everythingand watch everything uhbefore you even get your feet wetyeah another one as well is and and mattmight roll his eyes at this one is iskind of going publicumthere there's a lot of value in instaying in the proverbial shadow so tospeak um i would urge people you knownot touh sort of start shouting from therooftops uh that they own bitcoin againbecause you know we talked earlier aboutkyc and how we kind ofcan paint a sort of red cross on yourback a little bit well shout from therooftops um when bitcoin hits anall-time high to all your friendsand might uh inadvertently do the samething one day um you know yeah 100 alittle bit jealous you never know he'sgoing to get jealous andtell somebody else you tell somebodyelse who'san individual that might want to try andget their hands on it soum i would be be candid about who youwho you speak to bitcoin about and it'sa bita double-edged sword that one because uhi think we've all got a little bit of apersonal responsibility to try and helpon on board others as well so um alsosay just kind of be selective about whoyou speak to it and what you sayyeah it is um it might sound a littlehypocritical coming for meum as aas as a as a public bitcoin figureumbutdefinitely in the beginning you shouldnotyou should you should not be talking youshould try and reduce how much you talkabout bitcoin don't make it obvious thatyou own bitcoin don't post on socialmediauh consider using a name like bitcoin qa does i mean it might surprise you buthe wasn't born with that namehe decided on that name himself for theinternet for his bitcoin workumin the future if you do want to becomemore public about ituhyou can do so in a moreresponsible wayum rather than doing it right in thebeginning you can never come back fromit once you do itum so it's something to keep in mindyou should never talk about your ownbitcoin you should never talk about yourown how much bitcoin you haveumthese are best practices uh you don'tyou don't uheven if it's a friend or a family memberit might seem like small amount todaybut in the futureuh it could be a large amount and theywill not forget it they tend to rememberone of the first questions mostfriends and family will ask you is howmuch bitcoin you own they love askingthat questiondo not answer it explain why you don'twant to answer it for themumif people do know you own bitcointhis is where that multi-sig setupreally shines because you can have itgeographically distributed you can haveyour keys in different locations um thatare far away from each other that makeyou getting compromised more difficulteven in a physical attack situation andobviously it is more ideal to live in aplace where you haveum proper gun rights and you can defendyourselfumso these are things to considerum if i was to do it againi probably would not be uh you know aspublic as i am about bitcoin um i made ajudgment calllater on in my bitcoin journey that ifelt we needed more public bitcoinfigures that were talking about realissues and specifically privacy um so imade that judgment call but there aresome mornings that i wake up and regretitumbut there are precautions you can takeand there are benefits though to beingsemi-public about your bitcoin usage uhmeeting people i've met some of the bestpeopleyou know i have i have basically i havefamily now that wouldn't exist otherwiseum but these are all things that youshould considerum as part of your bitcoin journey butin the beginningvery very very stronglywould sayyou know keep keep it as discreet aspossibleum you never knowyou knowyou you don't want to expose yourself toa malicious actor your government couldturn on bitcoina foreign government can use thatinformation against you uh if you'retraveling across a border or somethinglike thatso you you want to keep this in mindyeah the final um sign off one for me umwould beuhi just completely got out of my brainuh what is another two fa is another onea good one to touch on i think um yeswould be um if if you and it's just comeback into me now so i've got two tofinish off um if you again listen tothis podcast decide that no kosc is notfor you and you want to sign up for anexchange and a lot of these exchangeswill prompt you to use uh sms-basedtwo-factor authentication to um i'musing air quotes here to secure youraccountum this is where you'll get a textmessage to when you try and log into theto the exchange they'll send you a textmessage to authorize that login um therehave been multiple umuhinstances where this has beenexploited people have had theirinformation and their accounts hacked onthese exchangeswhich if youunfortunately have got funds on thataccountcan be withdrawn to whoever's got accessto your account they can withdraw it totheir own walletanda better alternative and would be to usean app-based uhtwo-factor authentication so an examplewould be umthere's one called anduh there's one called a edgiest uhthere's another one called um help meout here matt i've drawn a blank umuh did you say agesyeah i said aegis yep aegis is myfavoriteany app-based one and far more secureand there's been far f well aegis isopen source aegis is open source uhthat's a e g i s and the backup processis very easy you got to remember whenyou when you use these authenticatorapps umif your phone dies you want to make sureyou have a backup of themso yeah the most popular one is googleauthenticator and it's notlast i mean i haven't used it inmaybe six years or something like thatbut previously it wasn't easy to back upso make sure you're using one that iseasy to back upand back it up and keep multiple copiesyeah or the other alternative is you canget umlike a physical device that acts as yourthe second factor authentication lookslike a bit of a usb key that providesthe the additional authorizationbut less services tend to umoffer compatibility with those100umi i would say i think for most peoplethe physical device is overkillum can a sophisticated attackercompromise a phone base two factoruh yesum have we seen any widespread cases ofthat no do they still need your emailand your password yes umon that note you shouldn't be using thesame emails and the same passwords indifferent placesum if you go to haveibinpone.com you canput your email address in and it'll tellyou wheneveruh database gets leaked with your emailor your password or your personalinformation um so that's a veryimportant resource but but what we see alot of times is like there'll be like aleaklike maybe facebook will get hacked andthose emails and passwords will then beused at all the other services to tryand get into your accountum so that two-factor code gives you anadditional protection on top of that butyou really shouldbe trying to limit reuse of emailaddresses and never reuse passwords umyeahuh yeah there's one in the chat scoobysnacks asking is a password manager agood idea yes definitely would recommendit to anybody my personal favorite isis bit warden again another free andopen source uh software they do offer apaid version as well but the thefreemium uhoption is perf is perfectly good enoughfor for uh 99 of users i would sayyeah bit warden's great um you justgottaif you're using a password managerum there's some nuance there because ifyou're not self-hosting your passwordmanager you're using awhat's the main onelastpass people love lastpassumit's closed source you're kind ofputting all your eggs in one basketuhso there's some concern there you knowif you if you have all your passwords inthis password manager and that passwordmanager gets compromised then all ofyour accounts are compromisedumwhat i think is like a veryuh easy accessible thing forumnew users or people that are concernedis is your really important passwordsyou can just write them in a notebookyou write them in a notebooksomeone's going to need to get access tothat notebook physically in order tocompromise youumyou might not want to write it outcompletely clear you know maybe somethings you remember versus some thingsare on the paperyou can develop your own like kind ofcode system don't over complicate ityou'll probably forget the passwordum[Music]but uhpaper and pen paper and pen is a triedand true methodyeah absolutely and then just don't putit on athe final one that went out my headbefore um waswe've spoken about uh you know there's alot of information the past couple ofhours umdon't try and uh do everything in thespace of a week especially if you areliterally at step one um i would sort ofpick one of these topics you know wespoke about them in aumin a specific order for a reason and iwould urge people to sort of start fromstep one and try and master each stepbefore they move to the net before theymove on or at least not try to do toomany of them at the same timedepending on the approach depending onthe the approach that you take for thedifferent tools that we've we've spokenuh you know to do it properly and to doit justice and to understand it andpractice it like we've been like we'vebeen sort ofreiterating it's gonna take you you knowum a good bit of time you're gonna haveto dedicate some time to do this and tomaster some of these tools so trying todo too much too soon is setting yourselfup to to fail so take your time uh beum deliberate about it and and sort ofmaster something then move onyeah and our i that's great advice andas bitcoin q a said our order in thisepisode was intentionalso don't feel like you have to gothrough all the steps at once butgo throughthat order was how we we we chose thatorder specifically because we think it'sa very um[Music]efficient effectiveuh managing trade-offs and stuff balanceof what order you should kind of becoming into this um we also have someperson in the chatum who uses the nim some person so everytime i call him out in the chat i soundlike i'm just don't care about his nameuh asking for the best a two-factor appfor ios i really like authenticator plusfor ios users um i think it's availableon android as well but if you're onandroid i really just like aegisumso yeah there you go for that answerum i have on this list bitcoin q a ihave common questions do you have commonquestions that you have in mind orum i've got nothing noted down but kindof umoff the top of my headum a common one that i get is sort of uhis umis this setup good for me or is thiswallet the one i should useuhyou know insert service or or tool hereyou know is this goodum it's the thing with bitcoin and andusing the tools properly that we've beenspeaking about is thatwhat matter i might recommend from ourown personal experiencesmight not be perfectly applicable toyour own personal uh throat metal threatmodels or skill set um soagain we we have kind of covered thisground a little bit earlier but is umjust try things out um you know by i'mnot saying don't come to the people imatter myself and ask for advice youknow we're always um more than happy toto to help out um but the best thing todo is to sort ofget your hands dirty and try these toolsyou know you can do it for for free orfor a very low fees at the moment andjust testing out wallets or or differentdevicesor multi-sig setups if you want to gothat far coinjoin implementationsumbest thing to do is get your hands dirtyget get amongst the communities and youknow what's perfect for one person mightnot be perfect for another so umit's a bit of adyor do your own research and getcomfortable with what's going to workfor you really100 um just to reiterate umbitcoin q a has all of his guides atbitcoiner.guideumi have a list of resources and tools atcivildispatch.comhelpat the top of civildispatch.com help ihave also i have links toboth bitcoin q aummyselfand our buddy katan from australia whoruns ministry of nodes offers uhwe offer private one-on-ones and there'slinks to all of that at the top ofcivildispatch.comhelpum so if you dofeel that you you have the need for aone-on-one a specific time to jump on acallum that is available to you as well ihighly recommend both bitcoin q aand and katan uh for that and that's whythey are at the top of that pageumi thinkuh narwhal tacos has an interestingpoint i i kind of touched on it but ifelt like it was a little bit too earlyin the episode so i didn't go heavy intoitumhe's asking have you explained that noone actually holds their sats in a wallat just the key it took me a while towrap my head around thatthat is absolutely correctum you're not actually storing yourbitcoin you're storing the key thatallows you to access and spend yourbitcoin um so when we talk about allthese wallets when we talk abouthardware wallets and mobile wallets it'sreally uh either piece of software apiece of hardware that is that isstoring that secret key for you andallowing you to easily access that soyou can access your bitcoin um i thinkthat's an important point but i i do iwould say thatthat's almost more of ai don't know i i feel like it's more ofan advanced thingfor all intents and purposes you cankind of operate under the assumptionthat you're holding your bitcoin in thewallet butum it is a good it is a good point thankyou narwhal tacos um i think with allthat said it doesn't seem like we haveuh any any additional questions in thelive chat i would add that obviouslythis is still dispatch 43 there's been42 other episodes filled with contentum well that's a lot more advanced thanthis so if you want to dive into thatafter listening to this obviously feelfree to do that it's all available forfree without ads or sponsorsum q a you have any any additionalthoughts here before we wrap upi just want to reiterate just getamongst the communities use the toolsget your hands dirty don't be afraid totry things out um come to myself or mattfor any help and advice and just oneother you know we've mentioned katan umone of the prominent educator in thespaces uh btc sessions got a fantasticyoutube page that's got guy video guideson using literally everything to do withbitcoin so um if you're more of a visuallearner uh check out his youtube channelit's a fantastic resource as well 100that is also linked at civildispatch.comhelp or you can just search btc sessionson youtubeum i made him a channel on bitcointv.comi don't think he has uploaded anythingtherebut there's also a ton of great contentat bitcointv.com that is curated one ofthe issues and the pitfalls you shouldkeep in mind when you're on youtubeumespecially the high view count videosare filled withscams and bad advice um so you need tobe very careful uh you know if you'rewatching a btc sessions video it mightrecommend another video that looks likeit's reputable and that a lot of peoplehave watched and recommended ityou need to be very carefuluhat the end of the day bitcoin's aboutpersonal responsibilityumso no one's gonna be there if you loseyour bitcoin there's no getting it backuh and there'sthere's a lot of money to be made givingbad advice and showing bad productso you really really need to beskeptical all the timethink for yourself make your owndecisions and constantly keep learningand i want to be very clear herethat i'm not asking you to trust meeitheror bitcoin q a or catan or anything elsewe've mentioned in this video in thisvideo or any of the other civil dispatchepisodesyou need to constantlyfigure out things for yourself and makeyour own judgment calls if anyone'sasking you to trust

bitcoin onapple pay here's what he saidit's something that we're looking atit's not something we have uhimmediate plans to douhfori would sort of characterize it as thereare things that i wouldn't dolike umuh our our cash balancei wouldn't go invest that in crypto uhnot because i wouldn't invest my ownmoney in crypto but because i don'tthink people buy an apple stockto get exposure to cryptoand so if they want to do that they canthey can uhuhyou know invest directly in crypto orthrough other meansuh and so i wouldn't do thatand i'm i'm not planning to in theimmediate future to take crypto for ourproductsas a as a mean of tender uh but thereare other things that we're definitelylooking at like whatuh like i wouldn't want tohave anything to announce todaywell let me ask you a different questionbecause you just said that you might notdo it personallydo you own crypto in any bitcoin orethereum would you play around with thisi i do yeah i think it's reasonable toown it as a as a part of a diversifiedportfolio and i'm not giving anybodyinvestment advice by the wayso[Music]happy bitcoin tuesday freaks it's yourboy matt o'dell here for anothercitadel dispatch the interactive liveshow

it's all encompassing from startto finish new new bitcoin are cominginto the space trying to do things youknow the right way trying to do thingsin a secure wayumand and just have it all in a singleepisode have it all in a singleconversationso as i was saying earlier the writerdies that are in the live chat um if youhave questions put your questions in ifif you're not a beginner and you'relistening in and you think we missedsomethinguh feel free to put that in the livechat as well and just a reminder thelive chat is accessible through thetwitter twitch and youtube streams andthey all getfed into uh the main chat so with allthat said i'd like to introduce bitcoinq a how's it going bitcoin q ahey matt it's going good thank you forhaving me back on uh it's been a while ithink um episode number two was now withthat with ergo so uh yeah lookingforward to getting back to it and uhrunning through some some of thebeginner-focused uh stuff that seems tobe missing from some of the podcasts uhfloating around me to tend to get jumpinto the weeds pretty quickly sometimesdon't we yeah i mean i have a feeling weare going to also be jumping into theweeds but we're going to try and do itin a nice constructive path into theweedsyeah i need you to keep me uh keep me incheck on that onebut yeah you are a dispatch lg it hasbeen it's been a minute and uh we'vewe've both been through a loti like to see like to think that we'vebeen through it together and uh yeahjust uhlove that you're back joining us and youknow i hope it's you know not just thesecond time it'll be many more times inthe futureumso with all that said freaks uh we havea bit of a structure that we set up forthis episode which is unusual fordispatch but i think it'll keep usmore focused um and so we're going tostart withactuallygetting bitcoin for the first timeum so do you want to you want to startwith that bitcoin q ayeah so uh it's buying bitcoinsnever been easier than it is todaythere's uh exchanges popping up all overthe place every every man in this dogseems to beuh giving you the opportunity to to beable to buy bitcoin from within theirecosystem or their appumthe the kind of elephant in the roomunfortunately and uh is is the um knowyour customer or kyc is it's uh it'slovingly called within the spaceumkyc is a regulation that essentially anysort of businessentity that has a banking relationshiphas to abide by that kind of dictates umthat they must collect certain pieces ofinformation from anybody that they givea service to obviouslyin the context of bitcoin that's anexchange that sells you bitcoin fordollars pounds yen whatever yourjurisdiction isumso in practice that looks like if youlike go on the cash app and you try andsign up to cash app to buy bitcointhey require you to upload your id youraddressuh i'm not sure some some servicesrequire like a selfie um that's whatwe're talking about right here which isthis identification information that'srequired when you sign up to one ofthese regulated servicesright and some of these are some ofthese exchanges now are even doing uhvideos where you they take that like a3d scan of your face which is kind ofscary really andso with all that said why why is thatkind of um why is that sort of a badthing that that people like matt andmyself sort of try andumwarm people away from or at least paintthe dangers clearly for everybodyeverybody um so when you supply thisinformation to to be able to buy bitcoinin a you know a really sort of easy andstress free way you know cash apps agood example where you can just in acouple of clicks get some bitcoin into awallet that you controlbut one of the main problems is that youknow all of this information getsrounded up into a centralized databasethat's controlled bythe entity that you're doing businesswithum unfortunately these entities or someof these entities they won't toureverybody with the same brush um don'thave a great track record of uh securingit effectively umtalk about perfect timing we we heardabout um a hack with uh robin hoodyesterday was it it was seven millionusersseven million users uminformation has been leaked um nowthere's varying degrees of the severityof the leak some of it's just emailaddresses uh some of it's more personalinformation like banking details etcumyou know to name a few others equifaxfacebook t-mobile clubhouse linkedinuh coinbase ledger um all of thosecompanies umrequiresome form ofof your personal information to to dobusiness with them and and they've allhad hacks where again with varyingdegrees of severity that um somebodythat shouldn't have got their hands onyour information did so i'm you knowwhat we're not talking small fry heresome of these uh hacks were in to thetune of millions and millions of ofpeopleum now you know if that's something likefacebook and your uh email address getsleaked you know it's not really the endof the world it might piss you off alittle bitwhen you tie that into umsomething like bitcoin wherehopefully especially after you'velistened to this podcast and you're sortof securing your own wealth that mightbe uh in your house that might be in aloved one's house or a combination ofthoseif uh if if the wrong person was to gethold of this information you know yourselfie your home addressum indicate in the case of coinbase howmuch bitcoin you've actually boughtthat is umessentially painting a very large crosson your front door that ummight make it inviting to the wrong typeof people to come and pay you a visit tosee if they can relieve you of of thosesatsso that's one of the main umyou knowuh reasons that that i personally tryand sort of make people aware that yesgoing on to cash app or coinbase orwhatever is is you know they make itreally really simple they've got reallynice polished uis to to be able to goand umget some get your hands on some statswithin it within a couple of clicks umit'syou know one of the big big risks isthat this information is leaked on aregular basis and there are companies inspace that to their credit and haveyou know they've nev never umbeen fallen prey to one of these attacksand but unfortunately they do seem to becoming um more and more uh frequent umso yeahthat's one of the main risks with kyc soyeah i mean i would add a couple thingshere uh first of all even if you know acompany hasn't been compromised yet weshould basically operate under theassumption that they will be compromisedin the futureumthis information once it is taken isoften soldto other people as wellit can be combined with otherinformation that was leaked from otherdatabases so for instanceumif you know you you have the facebookleak and the facebook leak has yourmailing address in it and then you havethe ledger leak and your ledger leak hasyour email address in it but thefacebook link also had your emailaddress in it they can combine those twouh leaks to get your full email addressand your actual in-person addresssecond of all we've seen umwe've seen physical attacks happen topeople who were known bitcoiners and howmuch bitcoin they had uh sometimes itwas because of these leaks it's hard totell for sure sometimes it's becausepeople just talk about their bitcoin andhow much bitcoin they own which you alsoshouldn't doumthird of alluhthis information can obviously be usedagainst you by your own government itcan also be used against you by foreigngovernments in the future obviously itis painting a target as you are someonewho owns bitcoin and uses bitcoin andexactly how much bitcoin you haveuh and then fourth of all in thecoinbase league specificallyumall of your withdrawal history was alsoleaked so uh it can be used to trackyour future bitcoin transactions uhbased on that information and we will gofurther in onon bitcoin privacy and trade-offs ofbitcoin when using bitcoin trying to useit privately how to go about that inlater on in this episode but these arejust things to keep in mindright so you know all of which is issort of incredibly scary um and theother thing final thing odds aboutbefore we sort of look onto thealternatives is that you know umsomething that i like to sort of keep inmind and remind people is you knowbeing here for number go up is great youknow i'm not going to sit here and saythat um i don't like to see us hitall-time highs all the time um butbitcoin is also umcreated to be able to make thetransactions that they don't want you tomakenowif you're sort of uh tying all of yourbitcoin to your personal identity umyou're you're kind of putting a inyour armor before you've even startedthat you know if you do want to makethose purchases that umbitcoin allows you to make um due to itspseudonymity thenyou're sort of starting two steps backby tying your your bitcoin holdings toyour personal identity um which is wheresort of buying from a new kyc source itcomes in so that you can have umsome or hopefully you know in a perfectsituation all of the bitcoin that youownso before we get there before we getthere just one more thingkycthese records are forever once once youdo these records you have to assumethey're foreverum is it best practice to delete anaccountum i you know if you're no longer usingit yes but you should assume that actualdatabase record hasn't been deleted umand it might be used against you in thefuture um so these are things to keep inmind umnow let's move to okay so if you'retrying to avoid kyc you don't want touse one of these regulated services whatare your optionsright so the the sort of uh two mostcommon ones that kind of get bannedaround in terms of actually purchasingbitcoin um is bisque uh which is apeer-to-peer uh decentralized exchangewhere you essentially it's a maker takermodel where somebody will want to umsell some bitcoin and they will go on tobisque and they'll say you know i wantto sell uh x amount of bitcoin for thismuch um you know 500 whatever and andthen you as a buyer can go on to thatsort of uh peer-to-peer marketplace andand look for these offers to see onethat sort of fits your bill that youknow was is within your price range andyou know the amount that you want to buyyou can go on completely and honestanonymously and and sort of take theirtheir sell offer so that you can buythat amount of bitcoin from themumthis isbisqyep so it's an application that you justdownload onto your computer basicallyyou run it all locally uh you knowthere's no personal information youdon't need to show any id's to sign upthe only person again depending on thepayment method that you use you knowthere's many many payment methods umsome are better from a privacyperspective than others and but let'ssay you knowmost people are going to go on and andif they want to sort of be able to takea wider range of offers from you knowmore people across the world they'regoing to want to use the banking systemwhich you know might ring some alarmbells to some other people listening butumwhat also i say is what's worse issharing your banking information withone person who is very likely to wantvery likely to be a privacy preservingindividual because they you know theyprobably wouldn't be using bisqueotherwise versus uh the regulatedentities that throw all of yourinformation into a centralized honey potthat we've just explainedum so that's one way you know some ofthe more private options that areavailable on bisc umare sort of postal money orders whichyou know i don't really know great dealabout um because it's a u.s centricthing um but you've also got cash in themailand then there's various various otheroptions that are kind of uh relevant totheir sort of jurisdictionsumanother option as well is huddle huddlewhich worksquite similarly to the way i've justdescribed with bisc and the thedifference being is a huddle huddle iskind of a centralized company um thathosts uh the sort of buy and sell uhlocations for you you know it's awebsite huddlehuddle.comum where you can go and sort of makeoffers or you can take offers again inthe same fashion umso so there may be some uh other alarmbells are in game where thinking whereum well what happens if i go on tobiscor to huddle hollow um and i youknow take this buy offer and i sendsomebody some some you know us dollarsand what's to stop them from just neversending me the bitcoin so both of theseservices um work on what's called anescrow system where the seller will haveto deposit the bitcoin first into amulti-sig wallet that is controlled byum by the buyer the seller and the sortof centralized entity um so thatbasically they theyuh can't sort of run off uh once they'veyou know got hold of your dollarsbecause they have to deposit the bitcoinfirst and and you'll be notified to waituntil you send any of the payments sothat they've proved that they've sort ofdepositedthe bitcoin into that um there is stillsome risk there but it's a reduced riskyeah absolutely you knowit's kind of i would say it's more of agrief and attack than ayou're not really at risk of losingfunds it's more of a um going throughthe arbitration process to prove thatyou've sent the dollars so that you getthe bitcoin back in the end so it'sgonna be more of a headache more than arisk to to actually lose any uhany cash would you sayyeah more or less umsoyeahcontinue so some of the other options umif youuh you can buy from bitcoin atmsthere's a really great website calledcoinatm radar.comwhere you can go on and punch punchingyour physical location i would recommenddoing sousing a vpnand and it will tell you all of thebitcoin etms thatare in your local area the the generalpremise of these is that you uh walk upyou can deposit some cashuh give it a um bitcoin address uhhopefully from a wallet that you controlwhich we're going to come on to laterand the bitcoin will be depositeddirectly into that wallet that youcontroluh there are again as is always the casewith bitcoins from caveats um justbecause you're depositing cash doesn'timmediately make bitcoin atm superprivate depending on the umthe brand of atm machine that you usesome of them do still ask for id um butthat is uh distinguished on the websitei've just said which is callingatmradar.comright some ask for id and thenand then some ask for just a phonenumber some ask for bothyeah which and obviously the the onesthat just ask for the phone number arethe better ones because you can spoofthat with services like textverified.comwhere you can just get kind of a burnernumber uh to satisfy the atm's umuh you know phone number requirementsbut obviously that's not tied to to yourpersonal identityum and then before we continue before wecontinue since we're still like early inthe episode and i should have mentionedin the beginning uh bitcoin q a has uhmy favorite guides in the space so ifyou want to look up somethingspecifically or if you prefer readingum if you go to bitcoiner.guidehe has all of his guides listed there sojust keep that in mind okay continueyeah pretty much everything that we'retalking about i've got some uhsome form of information on it um soyeah moving on to other noko i seeopportunities um so we've covered uhpeer-to-peer peer-to-peer exchangeswe've covered atms and the the next sortof option is to uh is to earn it umwhich might sound a bit outlandish tosome people are new and entering thespace but also we'll say is thatumeverybody has some form of a uniqueskill um and there's always going to besomebody who needs umwhat you can offer them uh it's justabout sort of uh trying to build up abit of a reputation whether that's inyour local area or online and so thatyou canyou knowsell your time or your skills andknowledge um and receive satsin in in repayment for themand the other option again probably notas much of a beginner optionas i would like it to be but the otheroption is to mine itumalthough home mining does seem to begoing through somewhat of a renaissancewhich is really really great to see andso the the general premise of that isthat you canbuy a bitcoin miner you can plug thatinto your um outlet at home plug in anethernet port connect up to to a miningpool and stream yourself somesecret sats or some private no kyc satsuh directly again into your wallet thatyou control umthere's been you know a fair bit of foodbanded around that home mining is iskind oftoo difficult or it's too expensive umthe the thing i would say is that yeahit's very much dependent on yourelectricity prices um but again you knowthis this shows fairly us centric andthere's a lot of places in the u.s whereyou know and if you'reum earning anywhere less than i thinkyou knownails in the chat they'll probablycorrect me on this but i think you'reprofitable mine at the moment anywherebelow 30 sats 30 shots yeah so i meanwith with all of these techniques youmight be spending a little bit moremoney than you would beum if you went through one of theseregulated services um you'rethe way i justify it is i mean you'reyou're paying a little bit of a premiumfor privacyand you're paying that for privacy goingforward too so it keeps paying dividendsuh with mining specifically mining homemining is a fantastic wayuh in my opinion ofaccumulating kyc free setsumit's really nice because once you haveit plugged in it's just constantly goingyou don't even have to really thinkabout it just constantly bringing inmore sets um we already have two wholemining umcivil dispatches so if you go back ifyou go to civildispatch.comor if you go through the podcast feed orif you go to bitcointv.com and ourplaylist over there you can find thoseepisodes and we're about to have a thirdone too uhi think november 30th there's gonna be athird home mining episode so if that'ssomething that interests you you shouldgo check those out uh starting with thefirst one uh because we literally spentlike three hours on all the differenttrade-offs thereyeah just to come back on on somethingthat you said about um generallyspeaking you're absolutely right thatyou're gonna pay uma little bit more for uh noko ac satsyou know especially if you go to thepeer-to-peer exchangesum but i just i like to try and reframeit and you know it's not a a no kycpremium and the theprice that you see on a kyc exchange ilike to call it the um the discount thatyou get given um for giving up yourpersonal information and puttingyourself uh a little bit more at riskthan versus uh getting some sats thatare not tied to your identity so i thinkthat's like that useful framing yeah thereal price is the private way and thenexactly discount if you sacrifice yourprivacyum and then one method that you didn'tmention which isprobably the most uh accessible to newcoinersis if you have a friend or a couplefriends that are interested in bitcoinand they've been in bitcoin for a whileum obviously if you can if you can paythem cash for some of their bitcoinum that is the most private uhi wouldn't say the most private but it'sdefinitely the most accessible privateway for a new coinerand if they if they don't want to sellyou any they might know someone whowants to sell some soum that's always something to keep inmind cashin person isextremely gives you very good privacyguarantees periodumwhat else also like if you knowto the to the bitcoiners out therelistening to this uh showum you know guide your new cornerfriends in throughthat kind of method right and whether ornot you want to actually explicitly sellit to them that's one thing butyou know if you if you go out to dinnerhave them pay for dinner with their withtheir cash or their credit card and thenpay them back in bitcoin orgive them you know birthday gifts inbitcoin and like get them started in apeer-to-peer fashion rather than justthrowing them to the wolves and sendingthem to a regulated exchangeyeah there's a couple of people in thechat that have just uh rightfullyshouted out um as techo vouchers as welland which is essentially uh you'll getsort of stores uh that sort of sign upto become an azteco um sort of vendorand you can go in hand over some cashand you'll get sort of a voucher whereyou can go and claim the the equivalentamount of sats from that again directlyinto a wallet that you controlthe the the other caveat the sorry theonly caveat with azteco is that thethe sort of uh kyc responsibility if anyis put onto the specific vendor so itwon't just be you know don't justpresume that because there's an articleum vendor near you that it won't be nokyc uh each one is sort ofuh left to kind ofcome up with the their owninterpretation of whether they need todo it or not basicallyand you have that major chain in you inthe uk that's an azteca vendor rightwhat's the name of thatit was poundland but then it stopped acouple of months ago and it's showing nosigns of coming back unfortunately uhokay so as they realized what was goingon they're like ah we can't too muchliabilitywhich was a shame because they they havea store in literally every town therewas hundreds of them and it was massivefor the uk but yeah unfortunate to knowmore okay well that's a shame um if youwant toread more aboutthe dangers of kyc you can go to bitcoinq a's website no kyc only dot comumhowever you decide to proceed withobtaining bitcoin and accumulatingbitcoinum the next step istrying to secure it uhsecure it well and secure it in a waythat you don't have to trust a thirdparty uh who can seize your fundsum so how shouldhow should bitcoiners how should newcoiners go about that bitcoin q awhat are their optionsthe natural uh first step for mostpeople unfortunately like we've justsaid is is um a centralized exchangeagain like coinbase cash app or someonesomething like thatwhere you will go on deposit dollars oryour local currency they will uh sort ofcredit your account with you know theequivalent amount of statswhat you have there is um an iouwhere you've got an account with themwhere they say that you've got this muchbitcoin essentially what you actuallyhave in real terms is uh well it's aniou and you don't actually hold anybitcointhe the sort of uh very essence ofbitcoin is the uh that you know thatgoes to say you're not your keys notyour coins which is banded around a hellof a lot and for good reason and itessentially means that if you're notholding the keys for your bitcoin uh youdon't actually have any bitcoinso you bought someone in exchange um thethe next step would be to get yourselfum a mobile walletwhere you can uh generate the keys uhwithin that wallet um so that your youand only you are in control of uh any ofthe bitcoin that you send to that walletum so before we before we move on andi'm sorry that i keep cutting you off ii hope i hope it's uh fine with youbefore you move on umso so the risk is if you're holding itif you're holding it in one of thesecustodial wallets which is what theexchanges default toum and there's some other services thatalso are custodial walletsumbasically the telltale sign of that isthe way you access it is through ausername and passwordumyou don't have any backup yourself whathappens there is there's a highlikelihood that your account could getfrozen we've seen that with paypal inthe past with fiat with just us dollarswhere paypal will freeze your accountand you're not able to get your moneyum it could be stolen if the exchangegets compromised or the custodial walletgets compromisedum and obviously you're trusting yourprivacy completely with the custodianbecause they know all of yourtransactions and your current balancesso it's not idealum and you want to learn how to holdbitcoin yourself becauseone of the revolutionary things aboutbitcoin is that you can hold it yourselfin a way thatumsomeone has to physically compromise youuh to to take your bitcoinum soi guess you're about to start withmobile wallets i think mobile walletsare the most accessible way getting awallet on your phone basicallyum to hold your bitcoin for you rightyeah just before i get down to themobile wallet it comes back to the pointi made earlier about censorshipresistant or being able to make thepayments thatum you know you want to make not thatthey give you permission to to make umif you've got to uh ask for permissionfrom an exchange to be able to sendbitcoin to your desired destination umyou know you're asking for permissionand you know that's not why we're herewe want to be able to spend our money towhoever we want whenever we want sofirst step and the easiest step is toget a phone wallet you know they're freethey're easy to access you know you candownload from any popular app store orquite a lot of them offer umdirect downloads so that you canuh download from the the you know thechosen teams umwebsite or or github umthe a lot of people tend to rush in andtry and buy um you know the next besthardware wallet straight away whenthey've just bought sort of 100 ofbitcoin to dip their toes in a littlebitwell if you you know if you're justdipping your toes in to see if thisthing's uh working for you then itdoesn't make any sense to you know goout and buy a hardware wallet and thisis coming for somebody who works for ahardware wallet company um it doesn'tmake any sense to go out rush out andbuy acouple hundred dollars on a hardwarewallet when you own less than that inbitcoin so that's why you already have aperfectly good phone that you carryaround with you it's very easy to spendand receive fromum but the important thing here is thatyou use a reputable mobile walletthere's a lot of scammy mobile walletsdon't just open up the app store andsearch for bitcoin wallet you will get alot of bad options thereyeah the the unfortunately the the top10 um results for that sort of search inmost of the app stores are quite abysmalmy personal recommendations would besamurai wallet if you're an android useruh or blue wallet or if you're an iosuser uh moon wallet is also another onethat i know you're pretty bullish onthat as well yeah both blue wallet andmoon wallet that's with 2us m-u-u-n areavailable on both android and iosumthey'rethey're very easy to use for beginnersuh i i would say they're not veryintimidating umso don't be intimidated you shoulddownload one just try itso the the kind of general premise ofthese and unfortunately i mentioned moonwallet there it's gonna umit's gonna book the trend of what i'mabout to say but the general premise isyou'll download the app from your chosenlocation uh the the app when you set upa new wallet the app will show you alist of 12 or 24 words which is yourmaster secret um you know which is thethe master backup to your to yourbitcoin wallet anybody that gets theirhands on that and be that physically ordigitally um is going to be able to takeall of your fundsso make sure that you write that downand secure it somewhere um safe andthenso moon wallet has a different backupmethod um it'll prompt you and explainhow to back up that butwe will focus on this standard which issomething we call seed words which isthey're basically these wordsit's a phraseand the wallet generates it for you andyou need to keep them secret youabsolutely need to keep them secret soyou don't want to put them on aninternet connected device you put themon you don't want to like save them inyour icloud notes folder you don't wantto take a screenshot and upload it toicloud what you want to do is at thebare minimum you want to write it downon a piece of paper double check thatyou wrote it down correctly store itsomewhere securely because if someonegets access to it they have access toyour funds but as long as you have thosewordsyour phone you could drop your phone inthe toilet it could fall you know itcould fall and crack and break or justcompletely justyou know some phones just like stopworking sometimesas long as you have those seed words youcan reinstall the app on a new deviceand just put in those words put in thatphrase words and you will have access toyour fundsyeah and the beauty of that is like yousaid most of the you know 99 of thewallets umin the space all sort of work to thatsame standard so you know you wouldn'tnecessarily have to even uhdownload the exact same mobile wallet aslong as the mobile wallet that youchoose umit abides by the rules which again mostof them do then you can sort of put thatseed phrase into into any other walletand there's a quick question in the chatwhich i think is probably good to touchon before we move on to hardware walletsandsomebody asked how much would you needto own to get a hardware walletnow obviously i'm not going to be ableto answer that for the for everybodythat that's watching you know it's quitean individual questionand all i would say is you knowif it's yourthe only mobile wallet you've gottenit's on your daily phone i would use theequivalent of how much cash would youphysical cash would you carry aroundwith you um you know what's your limitat which it's gonna start um affectingyour life if you used to lose thatbalance umthe quick review the mobile wallet themobile wallet should be like almostconsideredis is like your spending wallet what youwould have right inin in your back pocket but uhgoing further when we go into moremethods of storing your bitcoin thatwould be more like a savings accountum except i you're about to say a caveatuh i mean i have my own caveat i wouldsayi thinkespecially if you're using a reputableonei think people can feel a little bitmore comfortable than the kind of amountof cash they would carry in their pocketum i know like i wouldn't feel morecomfortable i wouldn't feel thatcomfortable carrying more than like 400in my pocketum but like a mobile wallet especiallyif it's your first wallet you're justgetting started you're gettingcomfortable you have your seed wordsbacked upuh your phone's up to dateyou know we don't seehacks are theoretically possibleobviously phones get compromised all thetimeumbut i i would probably if i had to picka number i'd like being like the 5 000to 10 000 rangelike that's where you start having toreallyconsider securing it moreum and you should also operate under theassumption because bitcoin tends togo up fastumyou should be prepared ahead of timebecause it could beyou know it could be a thousand dollarsin there and then in six months it couldbe worth eight thousand dollarsyeah the the other thing i would say aswell is that thisalmost everybody has got a spare phonelying around at the house that you knowyou could use that as your sort ofdedicated bitcoin phone and where youcouldbe slightly more comfortable storing youknow maybe larger amountsrelative to the individual and and thenyou could kind of decant off into yoursort of daily phone what you might wantto spend on a day-to-day basisabsolutely nothing wrong with thatapproach as well if you didn't want toand shell out quickly for for umfor a hardware wallet which we can wecan come on to now and so hardwarewallet is well before we get to hardwarewallets you also havethere's also software wallets on on thecomputer that you can haveright so you have mobile wallets youhave software wallets on your computerwhere it's like you install an app onyour computerumi i mean i would saylike unless you're an advanced user andyou have like a dedicated computer andthis episode isn't for advanced usersthey should probably shy away from thatin the beginning i i think the mobilesecurity model is a stronger securitymodel as you know as long as you're notworried about like the nsa or somethingum or like the chinese intelligenceservicesor these intelligence services um mostmost of the population uh are not greatat securing their their computer uh mostpeople's computers are unless you'resort ofa bit of a hacker man there's this youknow a far more vulnerable device thanyour mobile phone iswhich is why like you said you know icompletely agree that i don't recommendthem especially for larger amounts umand i tend to sort of skip straight tothe hardware wallet after the mobilewallet stageumsohardware wallets um are essentially adedicated uh physical deviceum designed to manage the the keys thatcontrol your bitcoin um so with thembeing a a physical dedicated device youknow their one purpose is to secure yourbitcoin whereas your phone hasyou know it's essentially a computer inyour pocket and with all of that extrafunctionality that your phone hascompared to a hardware walletincreases the theoretical attack vectorswhere hackers orthe nsa whoever can umsort of try and attempt to get theirhands on your bitcoin so these devicesare very focused andthey're focused at securing your bitcoinfrom physical attack um and also uh fromum digital attack ie uh you knowsomebody stealing your keys um over theinternet if you were to connect one ofthese devices to your uhvery likely highly insecure computerumso they a lot of them most of the goodones um work uh you know that theirprimary umway of of sort of keeping things secureis that they operate with what's knownas an air gap where they they canoperate without being connectedphysically to to any other device andbecauseit's that physical umconnection that sometimes can introduceuh uh intro um extrathreat factors so the the idea just todistill it here like the idea of ahardware wallet is that you have aa device that's builtto securely hold your bitcoin welltechnically it's holding the keys toyour bitcoinum butfor all intents and purposes it's it'syou can think of it as holding yourbitcoin and and it interacts with eitheryour computer or your phone in a waythat those keysall the keys are what protect yourbitcoin gives you access to bitcoin andyou don't want someone else to haveaccess to those keys it keeps those keysoff that computer or off that phone soit stays on the deviceand that device is never connected tothe internet sothethe basic concept behind securingyour stash with a hardware wallet isthatuh for someone to compromise you theyneed to physically have access to youand the device orif they can compromise the device justthe device but they like have to comeinto your home or come into your officeand get that device rather than hackingyou through the internetright and you know the even um if ageneric attacker was togain physical access to to most of thesedevices and they're still going to um afair bit of time and a hell of a lot ofequipment to be able to um you knowcrack theum protections on the device to be abletoaccess the keys um and to be able tosteal your bitcoin so it's not just acase of umprotecting you from a malware infestedcomputer um if somebody was to break inthere's still pin protection on thedevice and so it's not just a case ifyou lose the device um and you loseaccess to your bitcoin again the thepremise that matt spoke about beforeabout writing down your seed words um isexactly the same with a hardware walletuh the differences here is that um thethe when you sort of uh generate thosethose 24 or 12 words and it's done in anoffline environment that's never beenconnected to the internet so that againit just removes that extra threat vectorwhere um you're not connected to anysort ofinternet connected devices so it's justthat extra layer or wrapper of securityperfectumshould wewhat is your favorite hardware walleti saw that one coming a mile offum so full disclosure um i work for a umhardware wallet manufacturer calledfoundation devicesand obvious biases aside i genuinelybelieve that we make the umthe best option for a beginner enteringthe space umit's incredibly secure but also veryeasy to operate uh so i should havenamed the devices called passport andand another great device is the callcard umwhich is probably looks a little bitscarier to the newcomer i would say umbut has some extra features um thatmight bemore beneficial for more advanced usersthat they could sort of leverage sothose would be my two favorites yeah iwould say my favorite is uh cold cardumi've used multiple versions of coldcards i highly recommend them umand then ifwe're not really going to go intocoins here but if youabsolutely need to gamble onother coins in the space rather thanjust bitcoin uh both foundation and coldcard are bitcoin onlyumi mean so i i would say either use aledger or a treasureuh hardware wallet if if you wantcoin support um but even in thatsituation you probably shouldgo with a bitcoin only hardware walletfor your bitcoin and then use the otherones for your coins and just likethe mobile wallets there are lots ofreally bad harder wallets out thereso don't just googlebest hardware wallet because a lot ofinfluencers are paidtopromote them so you'll see youtubevideos with 500 000 views saying to usea horrible hardware wallet soconsider thatyeah what i would say just to back thatup again is that you know likelihood isif you're listening to this that you'reat least aware um ofyou know bitcoin twitter and the peoplethat are umaround and popular on there and most ofthose people have been around for a goodnumber of years and they've probablytried all of these devices so look towhat most most of theirmost of those people are using or atleast recommended and when you're sortof doing your own research to see whichdevice is going to be best for youperfectumwhen they're using their hardware walletthey need to use it with awith software they need to use it withan appso what are your recommendations forwhich apps they should use with theirhardware walletthe best two for meif you want to stay on desktop whichgenerally gives you sort of a little bitmore extra functionality would be numberone be spiral wallet um hands down myfavorite umor if you like a little bit of a sort ofeasier to to operate interface with kindof lessadvanced features spectre desktop isalso a great onetwo great recommendations spectre usedto be my favorite now sparrow's myfavoriteyeah um whichmight uh be a good segue for what we'vegot coming up next uh well before we getthereyou can also useyou can also use both the cold card andthe foundation passport with blue walleton mobile so if youare going through the steps and you gotcomfortable with blue wallet alreadyum because you started with a mobilewallet uh you can then use blue walletwith both of those hardware walletswhich is nice especially i mean i ithink some people listening to thisprobably don't have a computer that'sso a lot of people don't have computersthey just have the computer in theirpocketyeah you know we're heading towards amobile first world aren't we if not ifwe're not already there and blue walletdoesoffer a great interface uh especially uhwith with the with the passport with theqr interfaces uh very very slick andvery easy to wrap your head around as abeginnerawesome okay so you want to go to thenext topicyou said yeah let'slet's hit nodes yeah so i talked aboutum inspector desktop and one of thegreat features about like the desktop isit actually has a built-in bitcoin nodeso uh the next step along your journeyuh hopefully will be to look to run yourown bitcoin nodeum a bitcoin node is you can look at itas your umsort of interface into your into thebitcoin world and it's going to be thatnext step along the sovereignty journeyso that you can and again one of the thebuzz phrases that you hear in the spaceis verify your own transactionsand so when you receive uh any bitcointransactionand that will bebeing passed to you via a whole networkof nodesand the wallet that you choose to usewill be connected to a node now thatnode could be uma centralized node or operated by anexchange uh it could bea node that you don't know who existsthat might actually be a chainsurveillance company or hopefully itcould be your own node that you can runum in your house relatively cheaplynow the benefits of of running your ownnode like i said is you can verify yourown transactions so that you can be surewhen somebody's sending you atransaction and that the transactionabides bythe this sort of rule set umthat the the network that you've chosento join umthat we all agree on uh to put that alittle bit simplea little bit simpler is that you canbe sure that sort of nobody's trying tocheat you and send you some fake bitcoinor a transaction that's not valid and sothat you know you might be selling goodsor services and they might be paying youin bitcoin for thatandand if you weren't verifying your owntransactions they might be able to umsend you um the way i like to frame itis it's using your own note to interactwith the bitcoin network you have to usea node and if you don't use your ownnodeumyou don't have counterfeit detection isis like kind of how i like to view itsomeone can kind of trick youuh into it into thinking you havebitcoin when you don't have bitcoin soyou want to use your own node for thatpurpose and then second of all which ithink is almost more tangible to peoplebecause to be honest uh we haven't seenthat's more of a theoretical attack andwe haven't really seen it play out itcould still play out in the future youshould assume it it will so you want touse your own node for counterfeitdetection but second of all it alsoif you don't use your own node um you'retrusting your privacy with whoever'snode you're using so you want to useyour own node so that you don't have totrusta potential potentially a stranger or acompanywith that that private transactioninformation and balance informationyeah it's about removing trustessentially and and by running your ownnode you're you're putting the trust inthe hardware and or the the softwarethat you are choosing to run uh not theone that's kind of been given to you ifyou're operating with an exchange or acentralized node runner and so there'suma a massive awash of choice and withvarying degrees oftechnical abilitythe the easiest way to get running withyour own nodeis to download a piece of softwarecalled bitcoin corethis is kind of the the sort of uh defacto software built by the the bitcoincore developers uh that is essentially apiece of software that you can in acouple of clicks download onto yourlaptop or desktop and and it will startto download the your own copy of theblockchain so that you can umtransact with the built-in wallet andto just to get started and verify yourown transaction that way that'sabsolutely the easiest way and as itouched on earlier uh spectre desktopactually has umessentially that built in as well justpackaged in a slightly different way foryou and so they're they're absolutelyfree and within a couple of clicksyou'll be on the way to downloading yourown copy of the blockchain and havingyour own node set upthe problem with a setup like that isthat umyou i can't really um generally speakingconnect any mobile wallets to it so ifyou were to want to transact when you'reout and about and you run bitcoin coreon your laptopand you wanted to send the transactionthe likelihood is you're not gonna haveyour laptop with you so you you know youwon't be able to to spend as easily assome of the node options that we'regoing to come up come on to uh in asecond i'll just pause see if matt's gotanything to add thereumyeah so i mean if you're using bitcoincore or if you're using the built-inbitcoin core inspectoruh yeah correct your you can't the mainnegative is you can't use it with themobile wallet the also the othernegative isum your transaction and balance infowill be on your computer so if it'sa computer you use for work or acomputer you use uhto play games or look at porn orsomething like that your social mediahabitit might be easily compromised and thatbecomes a it becomes mostly it becomes aprivacy issueumbecause all your transaction historywill be there and all of your balancehistory will be thereum but also you can't use it with mobilewallets which is a key component as wellyeah so so the next best option um andunfortunately the most expensive optionis what's known as a plug and play nodeso this is where you'll buyessentially a small box from one of thevarious teamsto name a few we've got uh ronin dojowe've got raspi blitz we've got startnine uh umbrell there's loads ofdifferent companies or my nodeno nothere's loads popping up um all withdifferent feature sets but essentiallythey sell your boxuh that you plug in at home you plug itinto your router you plug it into thepower outletand then within a couple of clicksyou're off and running again to to getyour own copy of the blockchain and haveyour no your own node up and runningand before we move on uh civil dispatchuhcivil dispatch 26i had all the major node teams on for aconversation ontheir node projects so if you'reinterested in having one of thesepurpose-built boxes or you a lot ofthose projects that were just namedallow you to actually buy the hardwareseparatelyand then install their software on it umconsider listening to that sill dispatchright so and the the kind of finaloption is the diy approach like matt'sjust touched on where all of theprojects that we just said and we'llhave a parts list you can go away andbuyspend a couple hundred dollars buying ahard drive and a single board computerand a couple of other cablesand build your own node and put your ownsoftware well put the software thatthese teams provideand onto that hardware uh the the endresult is that you get um the same nodewith all the same features um obviouslythe caveat is that you've got to gothrough the process of buying thehardware yourself flashing the softwareand onto a micro sd card uh which mightcause you some you know if you're a lesstechnical user and you're lesscomfortable with taking that approachand that's why the teams offer theplug-and-play note it does sound moreintimidating than it actually isand i would absolutelyso like i encourage new users to gettheir feet wet um also juston thejust to go back a little bit aboutbitcoin core i mean if you're using youcan use you can also use bitcoin core ifyou're running bitcoin core on the samecomputer you're running spectre on or asparrow they both can connect to itumif you do that process you really shouldbe using it on a dedicated computer iknow i like kind of touched on thatearlier when i said you know if you'reusing it for playing games or socialmediait could get compromised easier becauseyou're using it for all these othergeneral purposes you're downloadingsoftware on it that maybe you haven'tverified you definitely haven't verifiedand have no idea what's really runningthereum so if you are going to go thatapproachyou should have a dedicated device youshould consider a dedicated computer adedicated phone that you are using withit um and uhyeah in general dedicated devices areare going to be more secure and moreprivate you'rewhen we when we talk about security andbitcoin land whereyou don't don't let perfect be the enemyof good don't get overwhelmed becauseyour setup's not perfect but at the sametime you're just trying toreduce your threats so that you're notthe lowest hanging fruit most of thetime when we see these hacks it'stargeted at the people that are mostvulnerableyeah and the just to go back to the diyapproach that was outlining umall of these uh different projects thatwe've spoken about have got reallyreally good documentation and quitevibrant communities as well uh ontwitter telegram or their own dedicatedforum and so don't be afraid to you knowgo and have a browser the documentationlike matt said it's not actually asscary as i made it sound um and also youknow go and ask some questions in the inthe telegram chat or in the slack orwhatever you know um chat room that thethe the project has gotum you'll probably find or you'lldefinitely find thatall of these the people that are inthese communities are really welcomingand they've definitely been in yourposition before now and and you knowthey they found uh the thought of thisreally scary a couple of years ago andyou know now they might be runningseveral diy notes so they'll be don't beoff-put by it100um i will echo that sentiment i wouldjust add a slight caveat that there arescammers in these telegram groups andthese chat rooms um they will often tryand impersonateuhpeople that are involved with theproject or other notable figures to tryand get you feel comfortable never nevergive anybody uh your seed words thosesecret backup boards never give themtheir secret backup boardsand you know always be skeptical ifsomeone in one of those groups tries todm you separately and tries to go into aprivate chat you know sometimes it islegit but you need to be extra cautiousin that type of situationyeah and and if somebody does don't beafraid to ask in in the sort of mainroom you know tag the person who youthink might have dmd you and said isthat his issue at the mme exactly butalways uh just act on the the on air onthe side of caution and and keep thatsort of adversarial mindset to think youknow why is this person reaching out tome completely out of the blue after ijust asked my first question enteringthe room100um so all those node projectssupport something called electrum serverand electrum server is a standardumit's it's a standard way to interactwith your own node um you can use thoseelectrum server details and then you canput them into sparrowyou can put them into many of the mobilewallets that we mentioned earlier youcan put them into blue walletwith samurai specificallythey don't use electrum server they usesomething calleddojoand with that pairing is as simple asthere's a qr code and you just scan theqr code with your samurai wallet on yourphone and it'll pair up with your nodeyeah the good thing is with dojo as wellis it's uh implemented in the vastmajority of the the note packages nowthere's there's more that have dojo thatthen don't which is really great to seeindeedshould we hit on the coin joinokay soi i just want you know we're we're anhour inum if you're a newcomer you just listento this hour and you're intimidated as uh don't be intimidated you knowstart with step one where we talkedabout acquiring your bitcoinumthen you know learn how to hold your ownkeys and slowly move through the processdon't you know freak yourself out thatyou know now now i gotta run a node toolike i'm now i'm really intimidated youknow step by step get your feet wet getcomfortable send transactions receivetransactions back up your wallet restoreyour wallet just get comfortable with itget used to it don't it's not somethingto be scared of it's something that youlearn by doingyeah i uh i put a tweet a couple ofweeks ago actually that kind of echoesthat that you know if uh sending atransaction uh makes you feel a littlebit uneasy then you haven't sent enoughtransactions um you can see on screenthere that the mempool is uh you knowit's a little bit busy than what it wasbut a couple of sats per bite is goingto get your transaction confirmed veryquickly and that's going to cost you youknow less than a dollar to send atransaction so we don't have we don'thave that on the list but before we moveon to coin join on chain privacyutxo management we should probablyhow does how does a newcomer choose whatfee to pay they open up their walletthey go to send a transactionumwhat like how do bitcoin transactionfees work i feel like that is somethingwe tend to gloss overyeah we overlooked that one um wellfortunately most of the the good mobilewallets especially the ones that we'veuh mentioned uh on tonight's stream uhwill give you a couple of options uhwhere you canum you'll they'll either have you knowthree options sort of low prioritymedium priority and high priority likeagain like we can see on screen or theremight be a slider where you can manuallyadjust the feeand essentially the the higher that thefee you pay the more likely that uh yourtransaction is going to be uh confirmedor processed quickeruh againa caveat with that one we've got a lotof caveats tonight is that umthe uh some of the estimation the feeestimations umthese wallets all use different sort ofalgorithms as to how they um calculateor estimate the fee that would berequired to get you confirmed in thedisplayed priorityso matt's got on screen here a reallygreatwebsite called mempool.spaceum which can it shows you again the thepriority uh fee selections uh or what itwould adviseand based on uh correct me from wronggame map but based on what's currentlyin the mempool um as well as sort ofhistorical data as well so it's kind ofaalways a really good sort of accuratelook at you know if you want to get yourtransaction processed within the nextblock uh right now it would take anestimate of 13 sats per byte um butagain there's a little caveat here thatthere's still umtransactions with much lower transactionfees umthan 13 sats per byte that will also getget confirmed so it's kind of umit's not an exact science uh i will saythatbut multiple sources is always a goodone if you want to try and uhget it sort of nailed so i mean bitcoinis a run by a companybitcoin is adistributed networkum and so as a result how bitcointransactions workiswe have this chain of transactionsand the transactions are within blockswe call them blocksumroughly every 10 minutes there'll be anew bitcoin block and it will havefinalized transactions included in thatblockuntil you get into a blockyou sit in a waiting list that waitinglistis we call that the mempool we call itamenpool technically every node hastheir own mempoolumbut if your internet connection is solidin most situations those mempools shouldall look the same so when you go tomempool.space you're looking at theirmempool that will look very similar toif you looked at the same thing on yourown node which a lot of these nodeprojects by the way allow you to runmempool.space natively with your ownnodesothebasically you have this like free marketthat's constantly going on where you'redecide wherepeople are choosing which fee they'rewilling to spend and miners are going tousuallyinclude you in a block based on yourorder in that waiting list based on howmuch you want to spendso if it's a transaction between someoneyou trust um and you're willing to waita longer period of time you can pay alower fee if you're sending just toyourself you can pay the lowest fee wecall that's one sap per byte is thelowest fee because you're just sendingit to yourselfum you know if if in some crazysituation where a one sapper by nevergets confirmed ever which we've neverbeen through you can always resend thattransactionso you're gonna want touh choose your transaction fee based onthe urgency you want that transactionfinalized on the networkand most good wallets will basicallygive you a low medium and highyou knowthislow being i can wait medium being likei'm in the middle ground because it'smedium and high being i don't want towait i want it finalized as soon aspossibleyeah andit'sit's a very much a dynamic thing it'slike a queue that's always evolvingevery single second because there's moreand more transactions being sent youknow every second andumit's not within you know outside therealms of possibility thatwhat the fee that you put up right thissecondmight not be enough to get youimmediately uh processed into the nextblock in sort of five minutes timeum so it's it's very very dynamic andyou know that's why i said it's not sortof an exact science so generallyspeaking for most people the walletestimators are pretty good especially ifit's an urgent transaction that you needto be processedimmediately100 i'm glad we covered that topicum also uhjust uh before we move on to the nexttopic just to jump backwith hardware wallets uhyou know the backup to that hardwarewallet are those words you wrote downumyou have the option of putting them intosteel these steel plates are availablemany different vendors offer the steelplatesand the idea there is if you put it intosteel obviously it's going to be waterresistant and fire resistant it's goingto be more sturdy than paperyou might also consider makingduplicates of those seed words andhaving them in different places so likeif your office burns down or your houseburns down it's still in the otherlocationwith the caveat that it meansit could be more likely that someoneelse finds it because it's in morelocations so you need to think aboutthat very carefullyand then third of all with hardwarewallets which i forgot to mentionone thing i like to tell new coinersis it's a good idea to have to buy twoof whatever you decide to buybecause if you have a second oneyou canyou can have the same backup wordsinitialized on both devicesso then if something happens to yourdevice not only do you have the seedwords available those those secretbackup words available to restore yourdevice you also have the second devicethat still has access to your funds soyou're not in a panic situationum so i always i tend to recommend topeople that they should buy two of thesame device whichever they choose umso that they they can have twoinitialize and you can keep those inseparate locations as wellif you wantokay yeah i think that's good adviceso when you're opening up a bitcoinwallet it shows a balanceum a common misconception isthatthat you know you just it shows yourbitcoin balance that's what's in yourwallet but in reality what's in yourwallet is basically a bunch of differentbitcoin transactions that all add up tothat balanceum we call those utxos uhthose those are unspent transactionoutputs utxos is what we call them youcan think of them like bills in yourwallet like maybe your wallet you knowyour cash wallet has50 in it but in reality it has two 20sand a 10and that's how bitcoin wallets work soyou have all these small utxos in therethat add up to your balance and that hasprivacy implicationsbecause ififtwo of those utxos come togetherum in a single transaction they'reobviously linked on this chainuh forever right we call it theblockchain it's this ledger oftransactions they'll be linked togetherbecause they were both spent in the sametransactionso that brings us to this idea of utxomanagementand coin control the idea oftrying tomanage thosebitcoin transactions in a privacy andcost effective way should you want to gointo that a little bityeah definitely um and quick i willstart with the two wallets that we keepmentioning blue wallet and samurai umoffer all the features that i'm justabout to cover that sort of help when itwhen it comes to to utxo managementandinspectoryeah sorry yeah i keep referring tomobile wallets but yeah the all of thedesktop uh the good desktop wallets thatwe've spoken about i've all got utxomanagement features as well um sothere's a couple of facets to it thefirst one is the ability to uh label thethe utxos or the pieces of bitcoin thatyou've got in your wallet so what wouldbe an example of a label might be thatif matt was to pay me for dinner uh orpay me back for dinner um when ireceived that transaction into my walleti could put a label on that to say thatthat's come from martin it was fordinnerum i could then receive my wages from myemployerumand i could put the the relevant labelon that just to know that where theorigin uhof that utxo is fromumso the once i've labeled themwhen i'm making future transactionsand i'mthere's two ways you can make atransaction you can let the wallet toconstruct it for you automatically whichthey might choose any random utxos andmerge them together again like matt saidto which will show common ownership thatmight not be a problem however if you uhwant to preserve your privacy and imight not want my employer to know thati'm friends with matt because he's a badperson um because i've labeled those i'mnot a bad person thoughbecause i play radical[Music]because i've labeled those utxos when ireceived them at the time um in you knowtwo weeks down the line when i'm goingto make a transaction um i can then chyou know consider and the person thati'm paying you know do i want them toknow that i know matt or do i want themto know that i work for the company thatpaid me uh with this utxo i can makethat informed decision then to say wellactually i'm just going to spend fromone of those pieces of bitcoin oractually it's not a bad thing matt's notreally a bad person i'm gonna combinethe two uh because the value that i wantto send i need to combine the twoum so those are the two two sort of mainfacets to it and and but obviously youcan't ummake a an informed decision when youcome to spend um if you don't know theorigins of all of the etxos that you'vegot and so they kind of go hand in handreally um you need to label so that whenyou come to spend you can make theinformed decision as to whether youshould merge or not yeah so a key aspectof bitcoin isif someone sends you bitcointhey can see where that bitcoin goes inthe futureand if you receive bitcoin you can seewhere that bitcoin came from in the pastsothis is why labeling is importantbecause you want to knowwhere that transaction came fromor it goes tobecausethat's who you're exposing your privacyto in that situationis that a good yeah installation yeahwhich you know um might not be a problemfor you know the person that i'm payingmight not um be able toor be clever enough to to use blockchainanalysis um but the other sort of umadversary that we need to consider hereis chain analysis firms that might betrying to umcluster or monitor your unchain activitywho you're spending to who you'regetting change back from uh to monitoryour habits to try and um piece togetherumyou know the identity because theblockchain doesn't have any identitiesat that at the blockchain layer um butthese companies work to kind oftie all the pieces together so that theycan um de-anonymize people and so it'snot just a case of umyou know hiding how much you earn fromyour friend uh it's also you know thesemore sophisticated actors that have gotmore a lot more resources to throw atthis and that you've also got to bear inmind as well unfortunately yeah you bothyou both don't want you don't want youremployer to knowwhat you're spending things onand you don't want the guy who sells youa sandwich to know how much money youmakebut on top of that we also have theseprofessional surveillance mercenariesthat work for governments dictators andcompaniesand they are just out there constantlytrying to track bitcoin transactions soyou also have that as a concernwhich leads us nicely onto coinjoin ithink if unless there's anything elseyou want to touch on no let's yep we cantalk about coinjoin now so coinjoin umis um acoordinated or collaborative transactionwhereyou and at least one other personwillcollaborate to construct the transactionthat casts some doubtas to theorigin and the output of the transactionto umto make suream thatstill could you still hear mei can still hear you yes oh sorry ithought i dropped out yes it's acoinjoin is a collaborative transactionwhere umthe the idea is that theuh somebody watching the blockchainagain chain surveillance firm youremployer your friend whoever they can'tumdeterministically orwith good probability be able to trackthepeople on the input side of thetransaction to the output side of thetransactionso it effectively attempts to put upsort of um a brick wall in your you knowthe the utxos history so that umanybody looking on chain can't be sure100umyou know is there one person involved inthis transaction is there 10 peopleinvolved in this transaction it justcasts doubt on the the uh path that thebitcoin has taken and and who sort of umyou know has the bitcoin change handshasn't it we we're not really sure so sotracking bitcoin is a probability gameumthese surveillance companies and theirtools will basically or just someonewho's curious and trying to spy on youum will basically assign a probabilityto every transaction if ownership haschanged because one of the things aboutbitcoin isyou know i could send bitcoin to myselfor i could send it to bitcoin q a anduh the chain doesn't delineate betweenthat so a key aspect of tracking bitcointransactions isumdetermining some kind of probabilitythat bitcoin actually changed hands andthen from there trying to seewhich hands it went from from who to whoum so coinjoin is this idea of acollaborative transaction and you canthink of it likeumjust for an example if you have fivepeople that are doing a coin jointtogetherinstead of uh having a simple path thatyou're following on chain and decidingif ownership has changed um all of asudden there's five different potentialpaths it could go downyou don't know which of the five peoplethat participatedwhich of their five outputs are themso it breaks that probability chainand it's a useful tool in terms oftrying torecr to have forward privacy have thisidea of someone who sent you bitcoindoesn't necessarily know which path yourbitcoin took going forwardyeah and specifically with umimplementations of coinjoin likewhirlpool which are known as equaloutput coin joints um the the the sortof notion is that everybody um on theoutput side all of the utx on the outputside of the transactionlook absolutely identical and soit's kind of uh i always like to use theanalogy of v for vendetta where you'vegot the million mask marchit's essentially the same thing but onthe blockchain where all of these utxosare indistinguishable from one anotherand so like matt said you've got someforward privacyand be quickand soi the the three major coin jointprojects our samurai whirlpool joinedmarket in wasabiumcitadel dispatch 15 was with the wasabiteam civil dispatch 16was with the join market teamand civil dispatchi don't know where he is i also did asamurai oneum is citadel dispatchit's there in your feed somewhere youknow uhstefan can just rattle them off he knowsexactly which one is which always amazesme that umi don't know which one it is i'll comeback to it and tell you but it's there'sthere's another dispatch with thesamurai team so if you're interested inthis uh consider going back andlistening to those threeumme and bitcoin q auh like samurai whirlpool the best youcan also you you don't have to usesamurai walla with it you can usesparrow wallet with it as wellumyeah yeah co-sign that samurai orsparrow a hands-down win is for me umespecially from a from a beginner'sperspective um definitely the easiestones to get started with in my opinionyou can continue on i'm trying to figureout which dispatchi'lli'll cover off one quick question that'sum quite on topic and somebody askedwhat's the difference betweenum coinjoin that we've just spoken abouton a coin tumbler so the unfortunatelythe words uh or the the meanings havebeen kind of umwhitewashed somewhat over the years butum generally speaking a coin tumbler isa centralized service where you willhave tosend inyour bitcoin and give up a custody of itto whoever's running the tumbler andthey will send you somebody else'sbitcoin backand i absolutely wouldn't recommendanybody use thesebecause you're putting yourselfum completely in the hands of whoever'srunning the tumbler and that you knowwhether they're going to send you yourbitcoin back or notand yeah soand you also not only you're trustingthem with your bitcoin if you use acustodial mixer it's the same ideas ascustodyum because custodial risks with walletsum you're also you're trusting them withyour privacy and your fundsum so the key aspect of coinjoin is isthe idea that you are reducing trust inany kind of centralized third party umwasabi and samurai have a centralizedserver that they doum[Music]that they use to coordinate the coinjoins to make them easier better uxuh and more reliablethose coordinators are blindedwith samurai specifically you can use itwithout your own node and then you'retrusting samurai's node so that goesback to our earlier conversation aboutusing your own node you should use yourown node when you use samuraiotherwise you are trusting them withyour transaction and balance informationas as is the case with all light walletsum i found it so so it's still dispatch15 is wasabi still dispatch 16 is joinedmarket and still dispatch 30 is samuraiso consider listening to thoseokay i think are we done on coinjsshould we move on to the next topic um ihave multisig as the next topic butshould we do lightning real quick firstsure thing yeah yeah i think it's apt umsoquick high level on what the thelightning network is uh it is a scalingsolution for bitcoin that umallows you toum transact with uhactual real bitcoin um but you don't doso with what's known as an on-chainfootprint and so it allows you to sortof lock up a small amount of well asmuch bitcoin as you want onto thissecond layer solution known as thelightning networkso that you can umyou essentially just defer the theoverall settlement um of any number oftransactions from going on chain to toreduce fees and also to allow you totransact um much quickerso whereas uh one on chain transactionyou know might cost you a couple hundredsats depending on the fees and you youmight be able to send you know 10or even 100lightning network um transactions forthe sameuh for the same amount of fees um nowthere is uhunfortunately lots of caveats with thelightning network again in terms ofbeing able to do it properly uh with uhthe best way to do so be with one of theuh no packages that we've spoken aboutbefore andwhich will dictate that you need tomanage your own sort ofyour own channels which is essentiallywhere you lock up this bitcoin to beable to to transact on this second layerumso it's a little bit more of a hurdle toto get on board with um but you you sortof can save yourself a fair bit on feesespecially if we ever see a feast bikeagain um which i think is inevitable umthe i don't knowinevitable um sofirst of all there's been a lot ofdispatches on lightning if you gothrough the feedconsider listening to those there's likea lot of different caveats and nuanceswhen using lightningspecifically with privacy i did a fullprivacy episode with openobs and anthonythat's still dispatch 21 that's onlightning privacyuh so consider checking that out but themain differentiation that you as a newuser should think about with lightningis going back to our transaction feeconversation earlierwhich iswhen you use a regular bitcointransactionyour transaction fee is not based on theamount you send it could be kind ofweird for youuh it's it's actually based on theamount of utxos that you useuh for the transaction it's based on thedata size not the amount of money thatis sentsoyou could end up sending a five dollartransaction with bitcoin on chain aregular bitcoin transaction and it couldcost the same as sendinga five million dollar transactionnow with lightningit's different the way fees arecalculated on lightning is based on theamount you're sending so that'll be morecomparable to something that you're usedto in traditional finance world where ifyou send more money you're going to paya higher fee you send less money you'regoing to pay a lower feenowuh moon wallet with 2us as we talkedabout earlier mobile wallet supportslightningand blue wallet supports lightning nowif you use blue wallet in its defaultstate with lightning it's going to be acustodial walletwhich i don't loveuh if you insist on using it use it witha small amount because they can takeyour funds you are trusting them withyour privacy um ifuhyou can also use blue wallet withsomething called lnd hub which some ofthese node projects offeri think umbral and my node offered idon't know who else offers it but if youuse it with lnd hub or your friend's lndhub then it's not custodial with bluewallet it's custodial with who's everrunning the lnd hub so if you run thelnd hub yourselfthen it's not custodialotherother lightning specific wallets onmobilethat you can use so moon does bothblue wallet does boththen there's lightning specific mobilewallets that are very good uh there'sphoenixwallet uh there's breeze walletumbreeze b-r-e-e-zcontinuing the bitcoin naming scheme ofusing words and spelling themdifferently um is there anotherlightning wallet that i'm missinglightningeclair as well haven't youwell claire is phoenixphoenixyeah why do they have two okay but yeahboth of those are good yeah one allowsyou to manage your own channels and theother one does it for youokay phoenix does it for youyepokay so forget eclair your new corneryou have phoenix and you have breezewallet or you can use moon or bluewallet and that'srather than for savings you should thinkof that more asokay this is like my spending wallet mytransaction fees are based on the amounti send i'm going to be sending smalleramounts umso i i might use lightning rightyeah i agree i'm quite a big fan ofphoenix um especially from a perspectiveof you know one that a wallet thatmanages the channels for you and i mightget a lot of for this in the chatbut i'm i'm a firm believer that mostnew users don't shouldn't strive todive head first into lightning withtheir own channels because it's it'sit's not easy it's not approachable andeverything that we've already discussedum in terms of holding your own keys umuh using coinjoin and and not using kycare far more important than uh strivingto get your own channels up and runningum quickly uh i don't know what youthink about that matt and i'm waitingfor the in the chat no i mean ithink i i i think umlightning on mobile uh with the walletswe just mentioned moon blueum breeze phoenixfor smaller spending amountsuh is very accessibleuh actuallyif you if you actually want to dolightning in a proper sovereign wayum that i would say is a more advancedthing don't get intimidated by it but ii think it's important for ourall-encompassinggetting started guide that we do mentionit it exists and what are the you knowdifferent trade-offs basically thetrade-off there is a little bit you'regetting less security uh you're gettingless reliability with lightning umbut you're getting lower feesfaster transactions all else equalum[Music]and it could be very useful in a mobilespending type of situationyeah i agreephoenix and brees really great ways toto get started with lightning that havesort of their own unique um trade-offsuh that kind of give the the best ofboth worlds from it from a new userperspectivewhen you compare them with umcustodial solutions like the defaultblue wallet or running your own channelsand that's one of theyeah i mean that's one of the reasonswhy i like moon so much like moon with2us has like different tradeoffsum it doesn't have a standardized backupprocessuh it's you know if if you'rea lot of big corners will say it's youknow not a lightning wallet but at theend of the dayit's not a lightning wallet because youstore all your funds on chain you're notstoring it in a proper lightning walletum but what's cool about moon isif you scan a qr code it could be alightning qr code or it could be aregular bitcoin qr code and it justautomaticallyfigures that out for youum and and vice versa yeah so so you canjust have you can have some spendingcash in your moon wall at muunand whatever whatever bitcoin qr codeyou scan it will send but it doesn'thave power user features it doesn't havethat coin selection that we were talkingabout with utxo management it doesn'thave labelingit doesn't have a standard backupprocessso these are all things to keep in mindright multisig multisig let's let's gohere's where we get into the weeds alittle bit um right so you've been inthe weeds for a whileall of the uh wallets that we've spokenabout umthe desktop wallets mobile wallets alloperate umon what we colloquially call a singlesig setup where they have um a singlesecret or backup um which is requiredwhen you want to spend your bitcoin amulti-sig wallet is where you combinetwo or more of theseseparate wallets together to create abrand new walletwhen you set up this multisig wallet youcan dictatethe minimumamount of keys required to be able tomake ato sign or authorize a send transactionso that could betwo from a possible three keys is apopular one all the way up to somethingelaborate like 11 or 15 you know whichmight be uh used in sort of a businesssetting props um but two of three whereyou need two signers from a possiblethree that were created to that we useto create the wallet to sign off on anytransactions from that wallet so whywould you want to do that wellwith a single sig wallet and some of thethree theoretical attack vectors ifsomeone's to someone but somebody was tosteal your deviceand and umwhile you know if they snatch your phonewhile it's out of your hand and you'vegot your wallet unlocked um they cansteal your bitcoin if that was one ofthe keys in a multi-sig wallet where youneeded two to spend from then they can'tsteal anything from youumanother one of the attacks that multisigprotect from is known as a retirementattack where there might be a malicioushardware wallet vendor thatdoesn't publish their source code um andthey umhave some uhmalware baked into into the the into thedevice and that is actually uh has theability to stealyour bitcoin i will say again correct meif i'm wrong game out but that has neverhappened again it's a theoretical attackbut if you were to use um a multi-sigsetup where you've got differenthardware wallet manufacturers if one ofthose is is maliciousum they can't get access to your fundsbecause they don't have you know if it'sjust one key out of two that arerequired they don't have the uhthe minimum number of keys required tosteal anythingall the goodall the good wallets all the goodhardware wallets are open source sotheoretically open source meansthat the code is available for you toverifyum and you can read the code line byline nowif you're a new coiner you're probablyup to this point you're already reallyintimidated you're like matt i can'tread codei'm aware okaysoat the end of the dayit is very good that you're able totechnically verify the code but mostpeople will be updating their hardwarewallets and they will not be verifyingthe code so there is some trust that youare you're trusting that hardware walletmanufacturer to not ship uh maliciouscode to you and you're also trustingthemuh that that the actual device wasn'tcompromised when it was first sent toyou right so with multisig the idea isyou can have multiple but specificallyin a hardware wallet ida hardware wallet multisig the idea isyou can have multiple vendorsuh that aremultiple different hardware wallets thatcome together to form your walletandyou needa combination of them as bitcoin q a wassaying a common one is two of three youneed two of them to spend the fundsthis reduces trust in any specifichardware wallet manufactureryou also have the added benefituh that those backup words instead ofthose backup words being aumone and done situation if someone findsthose secret backup words we call themseed words if someone finds those wordsthey have access to your funds in amulti-sig setup you haveummultiple sets of backup words and theyhave to find the required threshold ofbackup wordsin order to spend your funds so ifyou're using a two of three you're gonnahave three sets of backup words you'regonna have three hardware walletsthose backup boards obviously can be onsteel as we said earlierum and you can have them in differentlocations so bitcoin gives you bitcoinwith multisig gives you this uniquesituationwhere you can have a geographicallydistributeduh security setup where you're holdingyour own coinbutthethe the keys to access it can be locatedin different places they can beduplicated you can keep copies of themin different places and for someone toactually compromise you and take yourfunds they're gonna need to have accessto a combination secretwe lost bitcoin q a about two minutesago or a minute and a half ago and i'mjust gonna keep talking until hereconnectssothat is the main benefit of multisig[Music]do not once again do not get intimidatedhereuhplenty of people store bitcoin in singlesig uh setups it is thenormal way of setting it upum this is something you might graduatetouh multisig ux multisigumi guess ux can be kind of a complicatedwordlike the way you interface with themultisig walletis a relativelynew thing in bitcoinumso it it has a little bit more of alearning curve it is a little bit morerough around the edgessoyou want to get really comfortable withit as i said earlier you want to bebacking up restoring spending receivinggetting comfortable with it separatelyof your single sig setupnow one cool aspect of multisigis that you canactually have a single sig walletuh so you can be using a hardware walletthat is single sig and then you cantake that single sig and you canactually also use it in a multi-sigenvironmentandit can be one signer of for instance thetwo of three in the multi-sig but alsoit could also be its separate walletum andi guess the main advantage thereumi guess there's two main advantagesthere first of all if someone findsyour single sigback up your your secret words uh itmight have some small amount of funds onit and they think that's all your fundsthey they can't tell that it's in amulti-sig setupumso they might just take that funds andthink they took all your bitcoin umthis thesecondary benefit isthat you know you can repurpose thesethese hardware wallets and use them formultiple wallets now one other caveathere is with multi-sig you do want toback up additional information besidesjust your seed wordsumbitcoin q a came in and then left againso i will continueumthe popular multi-sig softwaresparrowspectre supports it blue wallet supportsitthey will tell you what you need to backup and make sure you save all thatinformation now that informationthat additional information that's notyour seed words umthey will have terms like derivationpathum descriptorthe list of something called x pubs youdon't necessarily have to know what allof that means you just have to save itand you just have to realize thatwhileseed words area security risk if someone gets yourseed wordsthat information that separateinformation that you have to back upwith a multi-stick wallet is a privacyrisk so if someone finds that they cansee how much you're holding in themultisig but they can't necessarilyspend itbut you need that information plus yourbackup boards in order touh to spend your funds bitcoin q are youbacki am apologies for that that'll happen ithink it's my networkno worries at all um i just continued onand i just kept talking about multisigdo you be holding it downumii get i mean i think we arei i think i sufficiently explainedmultisig tradeoffs and and benefitsumshould we move on to mistakes commonmistakesyeah did you cover sort of thealternatives to doing it yourself themultitec approach no i didn't that'sgreat why don't you go into thatyeah so obviously matt's just outlinedsome of the potential pitfalls withdoing it yourself umso one of the other options is known askind of collaborative custodyalternatives where um there will be acentralized service uhsome examples are on chain capital anduh casaumwhere they will help you coordinate amultisit quorum and where they hold oneof the keysand so that in the event that you wereto umso i'll give you an example you'd have akey on your mobile phoneyou'd have a key on a hardware walletand one of theseservices will hold the key as wellso they only have one key so they can'tsteal from you which is greatumbut if you were to lose say your phonewhat their key or the key on yourhardware while and he didn't have itbacked up they will be able to step inas a third party to help you move yourbitcoin so that in a doomsday scenarioand you um you don't lose your lifesavings which is really greatyou will pay for this service and againi'm not sure on how much each charge thebottom tier i think is just over 100umlast time i checked per year and one ofthe the trade-offs with this is that umunless you sign up uh without yourpersonal information which i believe isquite difficult to do umthethese uh centralized um entities thathold the key and part of yourmulti-sitcorum they know who you arethey know how much bitcoin you hold inthat wallet because they hold one of thekeys and they alsohold the sort of uhthe wallet file if you like to put itsimply and so that they canjust as a kyc exchange can umbe able to tie you to your bitcoinidentity so it's worth paying up thetrade-offs yeah and you're using theirnode sothe assumption is if you do this if youuse one of these providersuh you're trusting them with yourprivacy but they will hold your hand andthey will have a spare key for you aswellum and they will help you onboard intothe process they will help you gethardware wallets they will go throughthat whole process but you are trustingthem with your privacy they know yourtransactions they know your balancesandin 99 of situations they know who youare as well uh they'll know the ipaddress of your of your devices that youconnect fromthis is all kind of getting a little bittoo much into the weeds but the key isthat you're trusting them with yourprivacyum i was explaining earlier justbasically doing it yourself so you coulduse your own note and you aren'ttrusting someone in that situation youcan still haveumother people hold keys for you so abitcoin q a started with a two of threesetup because that's a very common setupbut another common setup is a three offive setup and if you do a three of fivesetup you have five total keys and youneed three to spendsoif you need three to spendyou can hold three keys yourself so thatyou know you have and you put them indifferent locations and you know youhave enough to spend it yourself butthen you can also have you know a familymember a frienda lawyerholdhold a key you can have differentcombinations of people hold the key soit can be very useful inum[Music]specifically in in situations whereyou're trying like inheritancesituations where if if you pass away youhave large bitcoin savings uh you knowmaybe a lawyer is holding one in a trustmaybe a couple family members areholding individual ones and theybasically all need to collaboratetogether in order to spend your funds ifyou have three keys with other peopleum but you can also do it in a way whereyou don'tyou don't they never have the thresholdthey need to compromise you pluscombined togetheryeah i think umjust one final thing before we move onto the next topic um inheritance is abig one for me that um i i sort of liketo drive over people who seem to seemkeen to kind of jump into the diyapproaches thatyou know you might have spent some timelistening to some podcasts watching someuh tutorials or reading some guides andfeel comfortable in setting up amultisigumsetup um but what happens if you're notaround tomorrow unexpectedly uh is yourspouse your next kin are they going tobe able to coordinate a spend from a twoor three or a three or five do they knowwhere to find the keys do they know howto recover it and if you answer no toany of those questions then uh all ofyour life savings disappears when youdisappear soand something to bear in mind especiallyif you're going to take the diy approach100 i'd also add that there's a middleground hereuh specifically supported by cold cardcalled seed xor and basically in thatsituation instead of having one seedit's not multisig but instead of havingone seed you have two seeds and you needboth of them in order to spend yourfundsso it's a little bit different thanmulti-sig it can be more accessible topeople uh because you don't have theseadditionalcomplications that we were justdiscussing with multi-sigbut it gives you that benefit of nothaving a single seedbackup wordsthat can be compromised by someonethere's also something that's supportedby pretty much every wallet out therecalled a passphraseand in that situation you have thesebackup boards are usually 12 wordphrases or 24 word phrases thepassphrase is the 13th word or the 25thword and you pick that yourselfso if you do that method then you cankeep the passphrase separate from yourbackup words if someone wants tocompromise you they need access to bothumand i mean if it's a weak passphrasethey might just take your backup boardsand keep trying pass raisesumbut it it adds an additional umburden on them to try and compromise youwithout going through a multi-sig setupum anotherinteresting thing about passphrases isyou can store money on the bear backupwords and then you cannot when you use apasswords it's a separate wallet soin that situation you can actually keepfunds on youryour basic backup boardsand then if someone finds that they'lljust steal those that money and theymight not know you have a passphrasewith the majority of your savings in itum so that's just something to keep inmindawesome do you want to cover off uh somesome common mistakesnext on the listyeah i think common mistakes is a goodspot to go nextuh so i've got quite a lengthy list hereandthe first one of which unfortunately iuhfell fell prey to a little bit um andthat is uh it comes back to our veryfirst pointof cape kycmultiple exchanges and without any realneed to really um so i've just uh sortof expose myself to you know put my nameon loads of different databasesand soit's an unfortunate one that you can'treally undo like we spoke about beforeand if you were to you know listen tothis podcast and decide that youumstill want to gofor a kyc exchange because you think youknow the task of going uh no care adviceandtry and limit your umyour exposure to this by just signing upwith one reputable exchange umi think that's a good one to start anddid youi think that's very good advice like ifyou are going to use a kyc service whereyou're providing your identityinformation you should choose itcarefully you should choose someone youtrust the mostand you shouldnot sign up for a lot of people justsign up for a ton of different servicesyou should only you should sign up forthe bare minimum ideally if you're gonnado it you sign up for oneyou use it solely just to buy bitcoinand then send it to your own walletsumand and you don't you don't use anyother additional kyc services you wantto limit that as much as possiblesecond thing is did you change your micsetup at all because it's way worse nowthan it was beforeuhhello i changed my computer um i'll havea player how much while you're talkingnow turn up is it just quietno we can hear you but it's just likebreaking up a little bit it's likecutting in and outall right i'll let i'll play aroundumanother common mistakeuhthat i see people make isi i mean gambling on coins so a lotof people will think that um bitcoin istoo expensive and i've missed the boatand i i'm too late to bitcoin umliterally every single person who hasentered bitcoin at any time in bitcoinhistory has thought they were too latethere's like a famous screenshot ofsomeone on one of the bitcoin forums uhlamenting that they didn't get in atfive cents and instead they got in at adollar and they were too late and theymissed the busum so everyone feels that wayuh you're not alone in that it'simportant to realize that you cantransact insmaller units of account we call themsatssoyou can you don't have to have a fullbitcoin you don't you don't you don'tneed like right now bitcoins at almost70 thousand dollars you don't need toput 70 000 and to use bitcoin uh satsare the smallest unit of bitcoin there'sa hundred million of themper bitcoin andright now sats you can get 1500 for adollar so you can send any amount ofsats you want to send you can send twodollars worth you can send 25 centsworthumit doesn't matter don't get caught up inin in thinking that bitcoin is tooexpensiveuhwhat common thing that these other coinswill dois they make it so they have so manyunitsthat it seems like it's cheaper than itis just to try and get you in the doorit's a it's a marketing tactic so justkeep that in mind uh q are you thereyeah how's my mic now oh so much betteri'm glad i brought it up perfect okay doyou have more common mistakesuh yeah common one um is just notpracticing umenough with transacting uh testing mybackups for my hardware walletstesting different wallets even usingtest net just practice practice practiceand getting comfortable uh using the thevarious tools that we've spoken aboutandgetting comfortable with it either usingtestnet which is basically uha copy a carbon copy of bitcoin that'shas that holds no value you can get itfor free onwebsites called faucets where you can goon and just mimic the normal behavior ofa walletand without the fear oflosing any real value and so you cansend some test net bitcoin to to your hardware wallet and youcan wipe it recover itand just to get really reallycomfortable with with that process sothatif um the worst was happening and yousomething was to happen to your houseuh where you say bitcoin wherever youstore your coin andyou're when you're in that packed stateit's not like the first time you touchyour hardware wallet for five yearsbecause you you know you've done thatyou know people call practice so you'vegot this lots of time if you send realvalue in there but it'sconnected to you and because you know ifyou're in a panic and you you need tomove your bitcoin quickly the last thingyou might be doing is doing itin unfamiliar uhsituation or in a familiarsituation wherebecause that's when mistakes happen andyou could uh muck something upyeah so we see that happen a lot whereyou know peopleuh so i actually don'tespecially for newcomers i don't know ifyou need to use testnetum it adds just anothercomplication to your processumbut but what happens a lot is likepeople will buy bitcoin they'll send itto a hardware wallet they never reallyuh get comfortable with itthen bitcoin goes up in valuesignificantly and like four years laterthey're trying to spend it and they'rejust not comfortable at allso you really want to get comfortablewith it you want to practice sendingreceiving backing up and restoring umand just you know i don't think testthat's necessary in that situationbecause you should just do it with thesmall amounts you knowuse you know send five dollars back andforthuh erase the wallet restore it from yourbackup see that your five dollars arestill thereum one nice thing about my earlierapproach that i mentioned if having twoof the same hardware walletis without putting funds at risk at allyou can load up one hardware wallet withsome bitcoinand then you can restore iton your second hardware wallet you canload up those secret words onto thathardware wallet and if your funds arethere and you can spend them then youknow you did the backup and restoreprocess correctly without actuallywiping the original wallet so that'sanotherbenefit you're basically verifying yourbackup and restore processyou don't want to be in a situationwhere you have a lot of moneyandyou have a lot of money on the line andyou've never done a backup you've neverhave you've never done a restoredprocess and you're just freaking out andmaybe you wrote down the words wrongi've had that happen to friends wherewe've had to guess the word that theythey wrote down wrong or wrote down inbad handwriting um so you don't youdon't want to be in that situation youwant to practice practice practicei think just to add to that uh backupprocess as well is thatmost of the umor the hardware wallets that we'vetalked about this evening havemultiple different types of backups aswell so i think it's worth noting thatpractice using both of them as well sowe've got the the siege words umboth call card and passport alsoofferingbackups as well where you can store itbackup onto a micro sd card um which is alittle bit easier to store and so iwould urge people to practice restoringfrom both methods as well becauseat the end of the day if again if in adoomsday scenario you don't know whichmethod of backup you're actually goingto have access to or which is survivedwhatever um you know doomsday scenariohas actually happened100um before we move on to more commonmistakes we have alex mccluskey in thechat asking about 401k ira fundsum if you're trying to hold bitcoin in aa in a in a tax beneficial way in yourretirement accounti would just keep this very simple uh ifyou do haveuh a 401k or an ira where you alreadyhave funds in it and you want to movethem into bitcoinjust consider using uh the serviceoffered by unchained capital that'sunchained.com disclosure they are asponsor of ofmy other show rabbit will recap thisshow does not have sponsorsumbut they're a sponsor becausethey're a good team it's a good productumi have friends there that are workingthere my buddy jeff andrew runs theirtheir retirement division and they willhold your handthey will help you through it obviouslyas we said earlier the caveat is you'retrusting them with your privacyum but pretty much in all situationswith retirement funds if you're using atax beneficial retirement uh methodyou're going to have to trust someonebecause it's all getting reported to thegovernment as wellthe nice thing about what unchained doesis you hold your own keys so you getthat tax benefit um but you're holdingyour own keys they can't spend yourfundsa lot of the other programs that are outthereumcan can spend your funds at will and youhave to trust them completely with thesecurity of your funds and your privacyso just something to keep in mindyeah the next one umfrom me is kind of a little bit moreoutside of the box umi lurked around on on bitcoin twitterand in some of the communities uh for alot longer than i really should have umwhen i started to uh interact with withpeople in the you knowwallet chat rooms or the no chat roomsand to use a few examplesmy knowledge grew exponentially fromthen onwards from having thoseinteractions versus me just sitting onthe sidelines and kind of you knowliking a few tweets every now and thenso if i was to go back and kind of havemy time again i i'd absolutely startgetting involved and start contributingand to the conversation much muchearlier because uh personally speakinganywaymy my knowledge just uh you knowskyrocketed compared to where i was justa couple of years ago and so big one forme that oneyeah that's uhand uh i just i think like learn bydoing right practice with small amountsumand get your feet wet rather than feelintimidated and feel like you have toread everything and listen to everythingand watch everything uhbefore you even get your feet wetyeah another one as well is and and mattmight roll his eyes at this one is iskind of going publicumthere there's a lot of value in instaying in the proverbial shadow so tospeak um i would urge people you knownot touh sort of start shouting from therooftops uh that they own bitcoin againbecause you know we talked earlier aboutkyc and how we kind ofcan paint a sort of red cross on yourback a little bit well shout from therooftops um when bitcoin hits anall-time high to all your friendsand might uh inadvertently do the samething one day um you know yeah 100 alittle bit jealous you never know he'sgoing to get jealous andtell somebody else you tell somebodyelse who'san individual that might want to try andget their hands on it soum i would be be candid about who youwho you speak to bitcoin about and it'sa bita double-edged sword that one because uhi think we've all got a little bit of apersonal responsibility to try and helpon on board others as well so um alsosay just kind of be selective about whoyou speak to it and what you sayyeah it is um it might sound a littlehypocritical coming for meum as aas as a as a public bitcoin figureumbutdefinitely in the beginning you shouldnotyou should you should not be talking youshould try and reduce how much you talkabout bitcoin don't make it obvious thatyou own bitcoin don't post on socialmediauh consider using a name like bitcoin qa does i mean it might surprise you buthe wasn't born with that namehe decided on that name himself for theinternet for his bitcoin workumin the future if you do want to becomemore public about ituhyou can do so in a moreresponsible wayum rather than doing it right in thebeginning you can never come back fromit once you do itum so it's something to keep in mindyou should never talk about your ownbitcoin you should never talk about yourown how much bitcoin you haveumthese are best practices uh you don'tyou don't uheven if it's a friend or a family memberit might seem like small amount todaybut in the futureuh it could be a large amount and theywill not forget it they tend to rememberone of the first questions mostfriends and family will ask you is howmuch bitcoin you own they love askingthat questiondo not answer it explain why you don'twant to answer it for themumif people do know you own bitcointhis is where that multi-sig setupreally shines because you can have itgeographically distributed you can haveyour keys in different locations um thatare far away from each other that makeyou getting compromised more difficulteven in a physical attack situation andobviously it is more ideal to live in aplace where you haveum proper gun rights and you can defendyourselfumso these are things to considerum if i was to do it againi probably would not be uh you know aspublic as i am about bitcoin um i made ajudgment calllater on in my bitcoin journey that ifelt we needed more public bitcoinfigures that were talking about realissues and specifically privacy um so imade that judgment call but there aresome mornings that i wake up and regretitumbut there are precautions you can takeand there are benefits though to beingsemi-public about your bitcoin usage uhmeeting people i've met some of the bestpeopleyou know i have i have basically i havefamily now that wouldn't exist otherwiseum but these are all things that youshould considerum as part of your bitcoin journey butin the beginningvery very very stronglywould sayyou know keep keep it as discreet aspossibleum you never knowyou knowyou you don't want to expose yourself toa malicious actor your government couldturn on bitcoina foreign government can use thatinformation against you uh if you'retraveling across a border or somethinglike thatso you you want to keep this in mindyeah the final um sign off one for me umwould beuhi just completely got out of my brainuh what is another two fa is another onea good one to touch on i think um yeswould be um if if you and it's just comeback into me now so i've got two tofinish off um if you again listen tothis podcast decide that no kosc is notfor you and you want to sign up for anexchange and a lot of these exchangeswill prompt you to use uh sms-basedtwo-factor authentication to um i'musing air quotes here to secure youraccountum this is where you'll get a textmessage to when you try and log into theto the exchange they'll send you a textmessage to authorize that login um therehave been multiple umuhinstances where this has beenexploited people have had theirinformation and their accounts hacked onthese exchangeswhich if youunfortunately have got funds on thataccountcan be withdrawn to whoever's got accessto your account they can withdraw it totheir own walletanda better alternative and would be to usean app-based uhtwo-factor authentication so an examplewould be umthere's one called anduh there's one called a edgiest uhthere's another one called um help meout here matt i've drawn a blank umuh did you say agesyeah i said aegis yep aegis is myfavoriteany app-based one and far more secureand there's been far f well aegis isopen source aegis is open source uhthat's a e g i s and the backup processis very easy you got to remember whenyou when you use these authenticatorapps umif your phone dies you want to make sureyou have a backup of themso yeah the most popular one is googleauthenticator and it's notlast i mean i haven't used it inmaybe six years or something like thatbut previously it wasn't easy to back upso make sure you're using one that iseasy to back upand back it up and keep multiple copiesyeah or the other alternative is you canget umlike a physical device that acts as yourthe second factor authentication lookslike a bit of a usb key that providesthe the additional authorizationbut less services tend to umoffer compatibility with those100umi i would say i think for most peoplethe physical device is overkillum can a sophisticated attackercompromise a phone base two factoruh yesum have we seen any widespread cases ofthat no do they still need your emailand your password yes umon that note you shouldn't be using thesame emails and the same passwords indifferent placesum if you go to haveibinpone.com you canput your email address in and it'll tellyou wheneveruh database gets leaked with your emailor your password or your personalinformation um so that's a veryimportant resource but but what we see alot of times is like there'll be like aleaklike maybe facebook will get hacked andthose emails and passwords will then beused at all the other services to tryand get into your accountum so that two-factor code gives you anadditional protection on top of that butyou really shouldbe trying to limit reuse of emailaddresses and never reuse passwords umyeahuh yeah there's one in the chat scoobysnacks asking is a password manager agood idea yes definitely would recommendit to anybody my personal favorite isis bit warden again another free andopen source uh software they do offer apaid version as well but the thefreemium uhoption is perf is perfectly good enoughfor for uh 99 of users i would sayyeah bit warden's great um you justgottaif you're using a password managerum there's some nuance there because ifyou're not self-hosting your passwordmanager you're using awhat's the main onelastpass people love lastpassumit's closed source you're kind ofputting all your eggs in one basketuhso there's some concern there you knowif you if you have all your passwords inthis password manager and that passwordmanager gets compromised then all ofyour accounts are compromisedumwhat i think is like a veryuh easy accessible thing forumnew users or people that are concernedis is your really important passwordsyou can just write them in a notebookyou write them in a notebooksomeone's going to need to get access tothat notebook physically in order tocompromise youumyou might not want to write it outcompletely clear you know maybe somethings you remember versus some thingsare on the paperyou can develop your own like kind ofcode system don't over complicate ityou'll probably forget the passwordum[Music]but uhpaper and pen paper and pen is a triedand true methodyeah absolutely and then just don't putit on athe final one that went out my headbefore um waswe've spoken about uh you know there's alot of information the past couple ofhours umdon't try and uh do everything in thespace of a week especially if you areliterally at step one um i would sort ofpick one of these topics you know wespoke about them in aumin a specific order for a reason and iwould urge people to sort of start fromstep one and try and master each stepbefore they move to the net before theymove on or at least not try to do toomany of them at the same timedepending on the approach depending onthe the approach that you take for thedifferent tools that we've we've spokenuh you know to do it properly and to doit justice and to understand it andpractice it like we've been like we'vebeen sort ofreiterating it's gonna take you you knowum a good bit of time you're gonna haveto dedicate some time to do this and tomaster some of these tools so trying todo too much too soon is setting yourselfup to to fail so take your time uh beum deliberate about it and and sort ofmaster something then move onyeah and our i that's great advice andas bitcoin q a said our order in thisepisode was intentionalso don't feel like you have to gothrough all the steps at once butgo throughthat order was how we we we chose thatorder specifically because we think it'sa very um[Music]efficient effectiveuh managing trade-offs and stuff balanceof what order you should kind of becoming into this um we also have someperson in the chatum who uses the nim some person so everytime i call him out in the chat i soundlike i'm just don't care about his nameuh asking for the best a two-factor appfor ios i really like authenticator plusfor ios users um i think it's availableon android as well but if you're onandroid i really just like aegisumso yeah there you go for that answerum i have on this list bitcoin q a ihave common questions do you have commonquestions that you have in mind orum i've got nothing noted down but kindof umoff the top of my headum a common one that i get is sort of uhis umis this setup good for me or is thiswallet the one i should useuhyou know insert service or or tool hereyou know is this goodum it's the thing with bitcoin and andusing the tools properly that we've beenspeaking about is thatwhat matter i might recommend from ourown personal experiencesmight not be perfectly applicable toyour own personal uh throat metal threatmodels or skill set um soagain we we have kind of covered thisground a little bit earlier but is umjust try things out um you know by i'mnot saying don't come to the people imatter myself and ask for advice youknow we're always um more than happy toto to help out um but the best thing todo is to sort ofget your hands dirty and try these toolsyou know you can do it for for free orfor a very low fees at the moment andjust testing out wallets or or differentdevicesor multi-sig setups if you want to gothat far coinjoin implementationsumbest thing to do is get your hands dirtyget get amongst the communities and youknow what's perfect for one person mightnot be perfect for another so umit's a bit of adyor do your own research and getcomfortable with what's going to workfor you really100 um just to reiterate umbitcoin q a has all of his guides atbitcoiner.guideumi have a list of resources and tools atcivildispatch.comhelpat the top of civildispatch.com help ihave also i have links toboth bitcoin q aummyselfand our buddy katan from australia whoruns ministry of nodes offers uhwe offer private one-on-ones and there'slinks to all of that at the top ofcivildispatch.comhelpum so if you dofeel that you you have the need for aone-on-one a specific time to jump on acallum that is available to you as well ihighly recommend both bitcoin q aand and katan uh for that and that's whythey are at the top of that pageumi thinkuh narwhal tacos has an interestingpoint i i kind of touched on it but ifelt like it was a little bit too earlyin the episode so i didn't go heavy intoitumhe's asking have you explained that noone actually holds their sats in a wallat just the key it took me a while towrap my head around thatthat is absolutely correctum you're not actually storing yourbitcoin you're storing the key thatallows you to access and spend yourbitcoin um so when we talk about allthese wallets when we talk abouthardware wallets and mobile wallets it'sreally uh either piece of software apiece of hardware that is that isstoring that secret key for you andallowing you to easily access that soyou can access your bitcoin um i thinkthat's an important point but i i do iwould say thatthat's almost more of ai don't know i i feel like it's more ofan advanced thingfor all intents and purposes you cankind of operate under the assumptionthat you're holding your bitcoin in thewallet butum it is a good it is a good point thankyou narwhal tacos um i think with allthat said it doesn't seem like we haveuh any any additional questions in thelive chat i would add that obviouslythis is still dispatch 43 there's been42 other episodes filled with contentum well that's a lot more advanced thanthis so if you want to dive into thatafter listening to this obviously feelfree to do that it's all available forfree without ads or sponsorsum q a you have any any additionalthoughts here before we wrap upi just want to reiterate just getamongst the communities use the toolsget your hands dirty don't be afraid totry things out um come to myself or mattfor any help and advice and just oneother you know we've mentioned katan umone of the prominent educator in thespaces uh btc sessions got a fantasticyoutube page that's got guy video guideson using literally everything to do withbitcoin so um if you're more of a visuallearner uh check out his youtube channelit's a fantastic resource as well 100that is also linked at civildispatch.comhelp or you can just search btc sessionson youtubeum i made him a channel on bitcointv.comi don't think he has uploaded anythingtherebut there's also a ton of great contentat bitcointv.com that is curated one ofthe issues and the pitfalls you shouldkeep in mind when you're on youtubeumespecially the high view count videosare filled withscams and bad advice um so you need tobe very careful uh you know if you'rewatching a btc sessions video it mightrecommend another video that looks likeit's reputable and that a lot of peoplehave watched and recommended ityou need to be very carefuluhat the end of the day bitcoin's aboutpersonal responsibilityumso no one's gonna be there if you loseyour bitcoin there's no getting it backuh and there'sthere's a lot of money to be made givingbad advice and showing bad productso you really really need to beskeptical all the timethink for yourself make your owndecisions and constantly keep learningand i want to be very clear herethat i'm not asking you to trust meeitheror bitcoin q a or catan or anything elsewe've mentioned in this video in thisvideo or any of the other civil dispatchepisodesyou need to constantlyfigure out things for yourself and makeyour own judgment calls if anyone'sasking you to trust thembe very very careful and just be verycareful in generalumbtc pins wants everyone all thenewcomers to know that they could buythey could buy merch from him atbtcpins.com so there you go btc pins

bitcoin onapple pay here's what he saidit's something that we're looking atit's not something we have uhimmediate plans to douhfori would sort of characterize it as thereare things that i wouldn't dolike umuh our our cash balancei wouldn't go invest that in crypto uhnot because i wouldn't invest my ownmoney in crypto but because i don'tthink people buy an apple stockto get exposure to cryptoand so if they want to do that they canthey can uhuhyou know invest directly in crypto orthrough other meansuh and so i wouldn't do thatand i'm i'm not planning to in theimmediate future to take crypto for ourproductsas a as a mean of tender uh but thereare other things that we're definitelylooking at like whatuh like i wouldn't want tohave anything to announce todaywell let me ask you a different questionbecause you just said that you might notdo it personallydo you own crypto in any bitcoin orethereum would you play around with thisi i do yeah i think it's reasonable toown it as a as a part of a diversifiedportfolio and i'm not giving anybodyinvestment advice by the wayso[Music]happy bitcoin tuesday freaks it's yourboy matt o'dell here for anothercitadel dispatch the interactive liveshow

it's all encompassing from startto finish new new bitcoin are cominginto the space trying to do things youknow the right way trying to do thingsin a secure wayumand and just have it all in a

you'relistening in and you think we missedsomethinguh feel free to put that in the livechat as well and just a reminder thelive chat is accessible through thetwitter twitch and youtube streams andthey all getfed into uh the main chat so with allthat said i'd like to introduce bitcoinq a how's it going bitcoin q ahey matt it's going good thank you forhaving me back on uh it's been a while ithink um episode number two was now withthat with ergo so uh yeah lookingforward to getting back to it and uhrunning through some some of thebeginner-focused uh stuff that seems tobe missing from some of the podcasts uhfloating around me to tend to get jumpinto the weeds pretty quickly sometimesdon't we yeah i mean i have a feeling weare going to also be jumping into theweeds but we're going to try and do itin a nice constructive path into theweedsyeah i need you to keep me uh keep me incheck on that onebut yeah you are a dispatch lg it hasbeen it's been a minute and uh we'vewe've both been through a loti like to see like to think that we'vebeen through it together and uh yeahjust uhlove that you're back joining us and youknow i hope it's you know not just thesecond time it'll be many more times inthe futureumso with all that said freaks uh we havea bit of a structure that we set up forthis episode which is unusual fordispatch but i think it'll keep usmore focused um and so we're going tostart withactuallygetting bitcoin for the first timeum so do you want to you want to startwith that bitcoin q ayeah so uh it's buying bitcoinsnever been easier than it is todaythere's uh exchanges popping up all overthe place every every man in this dogseems to beuh giving you the opportunity to to beable to buy bitcoin from within theirecosystem or their appumthe the kind of elephant in the roomunfortunately and uh is is the um knowyour customer or kyc is it's uh it'slovingly called within the spaceumkyc is a regulation that essentially anysort of businessentity that has a banking relationshiphas to abide by that kind of dictates umthat they must collect certain pieces ofinformation from anybody that they givea service to obviouslyin the context of bitcoin that's anexchange that sells you bitcoin fordollars pounds yen whatever yourjurisdiction isumso in practice that looks like if youlike go on the cash app and you try andsign up to cash app to buy bitcointhey require you to upload your id youraddressuh i'm not sure some some servicesrequire like a selfie um that's whatwe're talking about right here which isthis identification information that'srequired when you sign up to one ofthese regulated servicesright and some of these are some ofthese exchanges now are even doing uhvideos where you they take that like a3d scan of your face which is kind ofscary really andso with all that said why why is thatkind of um why is that sort of a badthing that that people like matt andmyself sort of try andumwarm people away from or at least paintthe dangers clearly for everybodyeverybody um so when you supply thisinformation to to be able to buy bitcoinin a you know a really sort of easy andstress free way you know cash apps agood example where you can just in acouple of clicks get some bitcoin into awallet that you controlbut one of the main problems is that youknow all of this information getsrounded up into a centralized databasethat's controlled bythe entity that you're doing businesswithum unfortunately these entities or someof these entities they won't toureverybody with the same brush um don'thave a great track record of uh securingit effectively umtalk about perfect timing we we heardabout um a hack with uh robin hoodyesterday was it it was seven millionusersseven million users uminformation has been leaked um nowthere's varying degrees of the severityof the leak some of it's just emailaddresses uh some of it's more personalinformation like banking details etcumyou know to name a few others equifaxfacebook t-mobile clubhouse linkedinuh coinbase ledger um all of thosecompanies umrequiresome form ofof your personal information to to dobusiness with them and and they've allhad hacks where again with varyingdegrees of severity that um somebodythat shouldn't have got their hands onyour information did so i'm you knowwhat we're not talking small fry heresome of these uh hacks were in to thetune of millions and millions of ofpeopleum now you know if that's something likefacebook and your uh email address getsleaked you know it's not really the endof the world it might piss you off alittle bitwhen you tie that into umsomething like bitcoin wherehopefully especially after you'velistened to this podcast and you're sortof securing your own wealth that mightbe uh in your house that might be in aloved one's house or a combination ofthoseif uh if if the wrong person was to gethold of this information you know yourselfie your home addressum indicate in the case of coinbase howmuch bitcoin you've actually boughtthat is umessentially painting a very large crosson your front door that ummight make it inviting to the wrong typeof people to come and pay you a visit tosee if they can relieve you of of thosesatsso that's one of the main umyou knowuh reasons that that i personally tryand sort of make people aware that yesgoing on to cash app or coinbase orwhatever is is you know they make itreally really simple they've got reallynice polished uis to to be able to goand umget some get your hands on some statswithin it within a couple of clicks umit'syou know one of the big big risks isthat this information is leaked on aregular basis and there are companies inspace that to their credit and haveyou know they've nev never umbeen fallen prey to one of these attacksand but unfortunately they do seem to becoming um more and more uh frequent umso yeahthat's one of the main risks with kyc soyeah i mean i would add a couple thingshere uh first of all even if you know acompany hasn't been compromised yet weshould basically operate under theassumption that they will be compromisedin the futureumthis information once it is taken isoften soldto other people as wellit can be combined with otherinformation that was leaked from otherdatabases so for instanceumif you know you you have the facebookleak and the facebook leak has yourmailing address in it and then you havethe ledger leak and your ledger leak hasyour email address in it but thefacebook link also had your emailaddress in it they can combine those twouh leaks to get your full email addressand your actual in-person addresssecond of all we've seen umwe've seen physical attacks happen topeople who were known bitcoiners and howmuch bitcoin they had uh sometimes itwas because of these leaks it's hard totell for sure sometimes it's becausepeople just talk about their bitcoin andhow much bitcoin they own which you alsoshouldn't doumthird of alluhthis information can obviously be usedagainst you by your own government itcan also be used against you by foreigngovernments in the future obviously itis painting a target as you are someonewho owns bitcoin and uses bitcoin andexactly how much bitcoin you haveuh and then fourth of all in thecoinbase league specificallyumall of your withdrawal history was alsoleaked so uh it can be used to trackyour future bitcoin transactions uhbased on that information and we will gofurther in onon bitcoin privacy and trade-offs ofbitcoin when using bitcoin trying to useit privately how to go about that inlater on in this episode but these arejust things to keep in mindright so you know all of which is issort of incredibly scary um and theother thing final thing odds aboutbefore we sort of look onto thealternatives is that you know umsomething that i like to sort of keep inmind and remind people is you knowbeing here for number go up is great youknow i'm not going to sit here and saythat um i don't like to see us hitall-time highs all the time um butbitcoin is also umcreated to be able to make thetransactions that they don't want you tomakenowif you're sort of uh tying all of yourbitcoin to your personal identity umyou're you're kind of putting a inyour armor before you've even startedthat you know if you do want to makethose purchases that umbitcoin allows you to make um due to itspseudonymity thenyou're sort of starting two steps backby tying your your bitcoin holdings toyour personal identity um which is wheresort of buying from a new kyc source itcomes in so that you can have umsome or hopefully you know in a perfectsituation all of the bitcoin that youownso before we get there before we getthere just one more thingkycthese records are forever once once youdo these records you have to assumethey're foreverum is it best practice to delete anaccountum i you know if you're no longer usingit yes but you should assume that actualdatabase record hasn't been deleted umand it might be used against you in thefuture um so these are things to keep inmind umnow let's move to okay so if you'retrying to avoid kyc you don't want touse one of these regulated services whatare your optionsright so the the sort of uh two mostcommon ones that kind of get bannedaround in terms of actually purchasingbitcoin um is bisque uh which is apeer-to-peer uh decentralized exchangewhere you essentially it's a maker takermodel where somebody will want to umsell some bitcoin and they will go on tobisque and they'll say you know i wantto sell uh x amount of bitcoin for thismuch um you know 500 whatever and andthen you as a buyer can go on to thatsort of uh peer-to-peer marketplace andand look for these offers to see onethat sort of fits your bill that youknow was is within your price range andyou know the amount that you want to buyyou can go on completely and honestanonymously and and sort of take theirtheir sell offer so that you can buythat amount of bitcoin from themumthis isbisqyep so it's an application that you justdownload onto your computer basicallyyou run it all locally uh you knowthere's no personal information youdon't need to show any id's to sign upthe only person again depending on thepayment method that you use you knowthere's many many payment methods umsome are better from a privacyperspective than others and but let'ssay you knowmost people are going to go on and andif they want to sort of be able to takea wider range of offers from you knowmore people across the world they'regoing to want to use the banking systemwhich you know might ring some alarmbells to some other people listening butumwhat also i say is what's worse issharing your banking information withone person who is very likely to wantvery likely to be a privacy preservingindividual because they you know theyprobably wouldn't be using bisqueotherwise versus uh the regulatedentities that throw all of yourinformation into a centralized honey potthat we've just explainedum so that's one way you know some ofthe more private options that areavailable on bisc umare sort of postal money orders whichyou know i don't really know great dealabout um because it's a u.s centricthing um but you've also got cash in themailand then there's various various otheroptions that are kind of uh relevant totheir sort of jurisdictionsumanother option as well is huddle huddlewhich worksquite similarly to the way i've justdescribed with bisc and the thedifference being is a huddle huddle iskind of a centralized company um thathosts uh the sort of buy and sell uhlocations for you you know it's awebsite huddlehuddle.comum where you can go and sort of makeoffers or you can take offers again inthe same fashion umso so there may be some uh other alarmbells are in game where thinking whereum well what happens if i go on tobiscor to huddle hollow um and i youknow take this buy offer and i sendsomebody some some you know us dollarsand what's to stop them from just neversending me the bitcoin so both of theseservices um work on what's called anescrow system where the seller will haveto deposit the bitcoin first into amulti-sig wallet that is controlled byum by the buyer the seller and the sortof centralized entity um so thatbasically they theyuh can't sort of run off uh once they'veyou know got hold of your dollarsbecause they have to deposit the bitcoinfirst and and you'll be notified to waituntil you send any of the payments sothat they've proved that they've sort ofdepositedthe bitcoin into that um there is stillsome risk there but it's a reduced riskyeah absolutely you knowit's kind of i would say it's more of agrief and attack than ayou're not really at risk of losingfunds it's more of a um going throughthe arbitration process to prove thatyou've sent the dollars so that you getthe bitcoin back in the end so it'sgonna be more of a headache more than arisk to to actually lose any uhany cash would you sayyeah more or less umsoyeahcontinue so some of the other options umif youuh you can buy from bitcoin atmsthere's a really great website calledcoinatm radar.comwhere you can go on and punch punchingyour physical location i would recommenddoing sousing a vpnand and it will tell you all of thebitcoin etms thatare in your local area the the generalpremise of these is that you uh walk upyou can deposit some cashuh give it a um bitcoin address uhhopefully from a wallet that you controlwhich we're going to come on to laterand the bitcoin will be depositeddirectly into that wallet that youcontroluh there are again as is always the casewith bitcoins from caveats um justbecause you're depositing cash doesn'timmediately make bitcoin atm superprivate depending on the umthe brand of atm machine that you usesome of them do still ask for id um butthat is uh distinguished on the websitei've just said which is callingatmradar.comright some ask for id and thenand then some ask for just a phonenumber some ask for bothyeah which and obviously the the onesthat just ask for the phone number arethe better ones because you can spoofthat with services like textverified.comwhere you can just get kind of a burnernumber uh to satisfy the atm's umuh you know phone number requirementsbut obviously that's not tied to to yourpersonal identityum and then before we continue before wecontinue since we're still like early inthe episode and i should have mentionedin the beginning uh bitcoin q a has uhmy favorite guides in the space so ifyou want to look up somethingspecifically or if you prefer readingum if you go to bitcoiner.guidehe has all of his guides listed there sojust keep that in mind okay continueyeah pretty much everything that we'retalking about i've got some uhsome form of information on it um soyeah moving on to other noko i seeopportunities um so we've covered uhpeer-to-peer peer-to-peer exchangeswe've covered atms and the the next sortof option is to uh is to earn it umwhich might sound a bit outlandish tosome people are new and entering thespace but also we'll say is thatumeverybody has some form of a uniqueskill um and there's always going to besomebody who needs umwhat you can offer them uh it's justabout sort of uh trying to build up abit of a reputation whether that's inyour local area or online and so thatyou canyou knowsell your time or your skills andknowledge um and receive satsin in in repayment for themand the other option again probably notas much of a beginner optionas i would like it to be but the otheroption is to mine itumalthough home mining does seem to begoing through somewhat of a renaissancewhich is really really great to see andso the the general premise of that isthat you canbuy a bitcoin miner you can plug thatinto your um outlet at home plug in anethernet port connect up to to a miningpool and stream yourself somesecret sats or some private no kyc satsuh directly again into your wallet thatyou control umthere's been you know a fair bit of foodbanded around that home mining is iskind oftoo difficult or it's too expensive umthe the thing i would say is that yeahit's very much dependent on yourelectricity prices um but again you knowthis this shows fairly us centric andthere's a lot of places in the u.s whereyou know and if you'reum earning anywhere less than i thinkyou knownails in the chat they'll probablycorrect me on this but i think you'reprofitable mine at the moment anywherebelow 30 sats 30 shots yeah so i meanwith with all of these techniques youmight be spending a little bit moremoney than you would beum if you went through one of theseregulated services um you'rethe way i justify it is i mean you'reyou're paying a little bit of a premiumfor privacyand you're paying that for privacy goingforward too so it keeps paying dividendsuh with mining specifically mining homemining is a fantastic wayuh in my opinion ofaccumulating kyc free setsumit's really nice because once you haveit plugged in it's just constantly goingyou don't even have to really thinkabout it just constantly bringing inmore sets um we already have two wholemining umcivil dispatches so if you go back ifyou go to civildispatch.comor if you go through the podcast feed orif you go to bitcointv.com and ourplaylist over there you can find thoseepisodes and we're about to have a thirdone too uhi think november 30th there's gonna be athird home mining episode so if that'ssomething that interests you you shouldgo check those out uh starting with thefirst one uh because we literally spentlike three hours on all the differenttrade-offs thereyeah just to come back on on somethingthat you said about um generallyspeaking you're absolutely right thatyou're gonna pay uma little bit more for uh noko ac satsyou know especially if you go to thepeer-to-peer exchangesum but i just i like to try and reframeit and you know it's not a a no kycpremium and the theprice that you see on a kyc exchange ilike to call it the um the discount thatyou get given um for giving up yourpersonal information and puttingyourself uh a little bit more at riskthan versus uh getting some sats thatare not tied to your identity so i thinkthat's like that useful framing yeah thereal price is the private way and thenexactly discount if you sacrifice yourprivacyum and then one method that you didn'tmention which isprobably the most uh accessible to newcoinersis if you have a friend or a couplefriends that are interested in bitcoinand they've been in bitcoin for a whileum obviously if you can if you can paythem cash for some of their bitcoinum that is the most private uhi wouldn't say the most private but it'sdefinitely the most accessible privateway for a new coinerand if they if they don't want to sellyou any they might know someone whowants to sell some soum that's always something to keep inmind cashin person isextremely gives you very good privacyguarantees periodumwhat else also like if you knowto the to the bitcoiners out therelistening to this uh showum you know guide your new cornerfriends in throughthat kind of method right and whether ornot you want to actually explicitly sellit to them that's one thing butyou know if you if you go out to dinnerhave them pay for dinner with their withtheir cash or their credit card and thenpay them back in bitcoin orgive them you know birthday gifts inbitcoin and like get them started in apeer-to-peer fashion rather than justthrowing them to the wolves and sendingthem to a regulated exchangeyeah there's a couple of people in thechat that have just uh rightfullyshouted out um as techo vouchers as welland which is essentially uh you'll getsort of stores uh that sort of sign upto become an azteco um sort of vendorand you can go in hand over some cashand you'll get sort of a voucher whereyou can go and claim the the equivalentamount of sats from that again directlyinto a wallet that you controlthe the the other caveat the sorry theonly caveat with azteco is that thethe sort of uh kyc responsibility if anyis put onto the specific vendor so itwon't just be you know don't justpresume that because there's an articleum vendor near you that it won't be nokyc uh each one is sort ofuh left to kind ofcome up with the their owninterpretation of whether they need todo it or not basicallyand you have that major chain in you inthe uk that's an azteca vendor rightwhat's the name of thatit was poundland but then it stopped acouple of months ago and it's showing nosigns of coming back unfortunately uhokay so as they realized what was goingon they're like ah we can't too muchliabilitywhich was a shame because they they havea store in literally every town therewas hundreds of them and it was massivefor the uk but yeah unfortunate to knowmore okay well that's a shame um if youwant toread more aboutthe dangers of kyc you can go to bitcoinq a's website no kyc only dot comumhowever you decide to proceed withobtaining bitcoin and accumulatingbitcoinum the next step istrying to secure it uhsecure it well and secure it in a waythat you don't have to trust a thirdparty uh who can seize your fundsum so how shouldhow should bitcoiners how should newcoiners go about that bitcoin q awhat are their optionsthe natural uh first step for mostpeople unfortunately like we've justsaid is is um a centralized exchangeagain like coinbase cash app or someonesomething like thatwhere you will go on deposit dollars oryour local currency they will uh sort ofcredit your account with you know theequivalent amount of statswhat you have there is um an iouwhere you've got an account with themwhere they say that you've got this muchbitcoin essentially what you actuallyhave in real terms is uh well it's aniou and you don't actually hold anybitcointhe the sort of uh very essence ofbitcoin is the uh that you know thatgoes to say you're not your keys notyour coins which is banded around a hellof a lot and for good reason and itessentially means that if you're notholding the keys for your bitcoin uh youdon't actually have any bitcoinso you bought someone in exchange um thethe next step would be to get yourselfum a mobile walletwhere you can uh generate the keys uhwithin that wallet um so that your youand only you are in control of uh any ofthe bitcoin that you send to that walletum so before we before we move on andi'm sorry that i keep cutting you off ii hope i hope it's uh fine with youbefore you move on umso so the risk is if you're holding itif you're holding it in one of thesecustodial wallets which is what theexchanges default toum and there's some other services thatalso are custodial walletsumbasically the telltale sign of that isthe way you access it is through ausername and passwordumyou don't have any backup yourself whathappens there is there's a highlikelihood that your account could getfrozen we've seen that with paypal inthe past with fiat with just us dollarswhere paypal will freeze your accountand you're not able to get your moneyum it could be stolen if the exchangegets compromised or the custodial walletgets compromisedum and obviously you're trusting yourprivacy completely with the custodianbecause they know all of yourtransactions and your current balancesso it's not idealum and you want to learn how to holdbitcoin yourself becauseone of the revolutionary things aboutbitcoin is that you can hold it yourselfin a way thatumsomeone has to physically compromise youuh to to take your bitcoinum soi guess you're about to start withmobile wallets i think mobile walletsare the most accessible way getting awallet on your phone basicallyum to hold your bitcoin for you rightyeah just before i get down to themobile wallet it comes back to the pointi made earlier about censorshipresistant or being able to make thepayments thatum you know you want to make not thatthey give you permission to to make umif you've got to uh ask for permissionfrom an exchange to be able to sendbitcoin to your desired destination umyou know you're asking for permissionand you know that's not why we're herewe want to be able to spend our money towhoever we want whenever we want sofirst step and the easiest step is toget a phone wallet you know they're freethey're easy to access you know you candownload from any popular app store orquite a lot of them offer umdirect downloads so that you canuh download from the the you know thechosen teams umwebsite or or github umthe a lot of people tend to rush in andtry and buy um you know the next besthardware wallet straight away whenthey've just bought sort of 100 ofbitcoin to dip their toes in a littlebitwell if you you know if you're justdipping your toes in to see if thisthing's uh working for you then itdoesn't make any sense to you know goout and buy a hardware wallet and thisis coming for somebody who works for ahardware wallet company um it doesn'tmake any sense to go out rush out andbuy acouple hundred dollars on a hardwarewallet when you own less than that inbitcoin so that's why you already have aperfectly good phone that you carryaround with you it's very easy to spendand receive fromum but the important thing here is thatyou use a reputable mobile walletthere's a lot of scammy mobile walletsdon't just open up the app store andsearch for bitcoin wallet you will get alot of bad options thereyeah the the unfortunately the the top10 um results for that sort of search inmost of the app stores are quite abysmalmy personal recommendations would besamurai wallet if you're an android useruh or blue wallet or if you're an iosuser uh moon wallet is also another onethat i know you're pretty bullish onthat as well yeah both blue wallet andmoon wallet that's with 2us m-u-u-n areavailable on both android and iosumthey'rethey're very easy to use for beginnersuh i i would say they're not veryintimidating umso don't be intimidated you shoulddownload one just try itso the the kind of general premise ofthese and unfortunately i mentioned moonwallet there it's gonna umit's gonna book the trend of what i'mabout to say but the general premise isyou'll download the app from your chosenlocation uh the the app when you set upa new wallet the app will show you alist of 12 or 24 words which is yourmaster secret um you know which is thethe master backup to your to yourbitcoin wallet anybody that gets theirhands on that and be that physically ordigitally um is going to be able to takeall of your fundsso make sure that you write that downand secure it somewhere um safe andthenso moon wallet has a different backupmethod um it'll prompt you and explainhow to back up that butwe will focus on this standard which issomething we call seed words which isthey're basically these wordsit's a phraseand the wallet generates it for you andyou need to keep them secret youabsolutely need to keep them secret soyou don't want to put them on aninternet connected device you put themon you don't want to like save them inyour icloud notes folder you don't wantto take a screenshot and upload it toicloud what you want to do is at thebare minimum you want to write it downon a piece of paper double check thatyou wrote it down correctly store itsomewhere securely because if someonegets access to it they have access toyour funds but as long as you have thosewordsyour phone you could drop your phone inthe toilet it could fall you know itcould fall and crack and break or justcompletely justyou know some phones just like stopworking sometimesas long as you have those seed words youcan reinstall the app on a new deviceand just put in those words put in thatphrase words and you will have access toyour fundsyeah and the beauty of that is like yousaid most of the you know 99 of thewallets umin the space all sort of work to thatsame standard so you know you wouldn'tnecessarily have to even uhdownload the exact same mobile wallet aslong as the mobile wallet that youchoose umit abides by the rules which again mostof them do then you can sort of put thatseed phrase into into any other walletand there's a quick question in the chatwhich i think is probably good to touchon before we move on to hardware walletsandsomebody asked how much would you needto own to get a hardware walletnow obviously i'm not going to be ableto answer that for the for everybodythat that's watching you know it's quitean individual questionand all i would say is you knowif it's yourthe only mobile wallet you've gottenit's on your daily phone i would use theequivalent of how much cash would youphysical cash would you carry aroundwith you um you know what's your limitat which it's gonna start um affectingyour life if you used to lose thatbalance umthe quick review the mobile wallet themobile wallet should be like almostconsideredis is like your spending wallet what youwould have right inin in your back pocket but uhgoing further when we go into moremethods of storing your bitcoin thatwould be more like a savings accountum except i you're about to say a caveatuh i mean i have my own caveat i wouldsayi thinkespecially if you're using a reputableonei think people can feel a little bitmore comfortable than the kind of amountof cash they would carry in their pocketum i know like i wouldn't feel morecomfortable i wouldn't feel thatcomfortable carrying more than like 400in my pocketum but like a mobile wallet especiallyif it's your first wallet you're justgetting started you're gettingcomfortable you have your seed wordsbacked upuh your phone's up to dateyou know we don't seehacks are theoretically possibleobviously phones get compromised all thetimeumbut i i would probably if i had to picka number i'd like being like the 5 000to 10 000 rangelike that's where you start having toreallyconsider securing it moreum and you should also operate under theassumption because bitcoin tends togo up fastumyou should be prepared ahead of timebecause it could beyou know it could be a thousand dollarsin there and then in six months it couldbe worth eight thousand dollarsyeah the the other thing i would say aswell is that thisalmost everybody has got a spare phonelying around at the house that you knowyou could use that as your sort ofdedicated bitcoin phone and where youcouldbe slightly more comfortable storing youknow maybe larger amountsrelative to the individual and and thenyou could kind of decant off into yoursort of daily phone what you might wantto spend on a day-to-day basisabsolutely nothing wrong with thatapproach as well if you didn't want toand shell out quickly for for umfor a hardware wallet which we can wecan come on to now and so hardwarewallet is well before we get to hardwarewallets you also havethere's also software wallets on on thecomputer that you can haveright so you have mobile wallets youhave software wallets on your computerwhere it's like you install an app onyour computerumi i mean i would saylike unless you're an advanced user andyou have like a dedicated computer andthis episode isn't for advanced usersthey should probably shy away from thatin the beginning i i think the mobilesecurity model is a stronger securitymodel as you know as long as you're notworried about like the nsa or somethingum or like the chinese intelligenceservicesor these intelligence services um mostmost of the population uh are not greatat securing their their computer uh mostpeople's computers are unless you'resort ofa bit of a hacker man there's this youknow a far more vulnerable device thanyour mobile phone iswhich is why like you said you know icompletely agree that i don't recommendthem especially for larger amounts umand i tend to sort of skip straight tothe hardware wallet after the mobilewallet stageumsohardware wallets um are essentially adedicated uh physical deviceum designed to manage the the keys thatcontrol your bitcoin um so with thembeing a a physical dedicated device youknow their one purpose is to secure yourbitcoin whereas your phone hasyou know it's essentially a computer inyour pocket and with all of that extrafunctionality that your phone hascompared to a hardware walletincreases the theoretical attack vectorswhere hackers orthe nsa whoever can umsort of try and attempt to get theirhands on your bitcoin so these devicesare very focused andthey're focused at securing your bitcoinfrom physical attack um and also uh fromum digital attack ie uh you knowsomebody stealing your keys um over theinternet if you were to connect one ofthese devices to your uhvery likely highly insecure computerumso they a lot of them most of the goodones um work uh you know that theirprimary umway of of sort of keeping things secureis that they operate with what's knownas an air gap where they they canoperate without being connectedphysically to to any other device andbecauseit's that physical umconnection that sometimes can introduceuh uh intro um extrathreat factors so the the idea just todistill it here like the idea of ahardware wallet is that you have aa device that's builtto securely hold your bitcoin welltechnically it's holding the keys toyour bitcoinum butfor all intents and purposes it's it'syou can think of it as holding yourbitcoin and and it interacts with eitheryour computer or your phone in a waythat those keysall the keys are what protect yourbitcoin gives you access to bitcoin andyou don't want someone else to haveaccess to those keys it keeps those keysoff that computer or off that phone soit stays on the deviceand that device is never connected tothe internet sothethe basic concept behind securingyour stash with a hardware wallet isthatuh for someone to compromise you theyneed to physically have access to youand the device orif they can compromise the device justthe device but they like have to comeinto your home or come into your officeand get that device rather than hackingyou through the internetright and you know the even um if ageneric attacker was togain physical access to to most of thesedevices and they're still going to um afair bit of time and a hell of a lot ofequipment to be able to um you knowcrack theum protections on the device to be abletoaccess the keys um and to be able tosteal your bitcoin so it's not just acase of umprotecting you from a malware infestedcomputer um if somebody was to break inthere's still pin protection on thedevice and so it's not just a case ifyou lose the device um and you loseaccess to your bitcoin again the thepremise that matt spoke about beforeabout writing down your seed words um isexactly the same with a hardware walletuh the differences here is that um thethe when you sort of uh generate thosethose 24 or 12 words and it's done in anoffline environment that's never beenconnected to the internet so that againit just removes that extra threat vectorwhere um you're not connected to anysort ofinternet connected devices so it's justthat extra layer or wrapper of securityperfectumshould wewhat is your favorite hardware walleti saw that one coming a mile offum so full disclosure um i work for a umhardware wallet manufacturer calledfoundation devicesand obvious biases aside i genuinelybelieve that we make the umthe best option for a beginner enteringthe space umit's incredibly secure but also veryeasy to operate uh so i should havenamed the devices called passport andand another great device is the callcard umwhich is probably looks a little bitscarier to the newcomer i would say umbut has some extra features um thatmight bemore beneficial for more advanced usersthat they could sort of leverage sothose would be my two favorites yeah iwould say my favorite is uh cold cardumi've used multiple versions of coldcards i highly recommend them umand then ifwe're not really going to go intocoins here but if youabsolutely need to gamble onother coins in the space rather thanjust bitcoin uh both foundation and coldcard are bitcoin onlyumi mean so i i would say either use aledger or a treasureuh hardware wallet if if you wantcoin support um but even in thatsituation you probably shouldgo with a bitcoin only hardware walletfor your bitcoin and then use the otherones for your coins and just likethe mobile wallets there are lots ofreally bad harder wallets out thereso don't just googlebest hardware wallet because a lot ofinfluencers are paidtopromote them so you'll see youtubevideos with 500 000 views saying to usea horrible hardware wallet soconsider thatyeah what i would say just to back thatup again is that you know likelihood isif you're listening to this that you'reat least aware um ofyou know bitcoin twitter and the peoplethat are umaround and popular on there and most ofthose people have been around for a goodnumber of years and they've probablytried all of these devices so look towhat most most of theirmost of those people are using or atleast recommended and when you're sortof doing your own research to see whichdevice is going to be best for youperfectumwhen they're using their hardware walletthey need to use it with awith software they need to use it withan appso what are your recommendations forwhich apps they should use with theirhardware walletthe best two for meif you want to stay on desktop whichgenerally gives you sort of a little bitmore extra functionality would be numberone be spiral wallet um hands down myfavorite umor if you like a little bit of a sort ofeasier to to operate interface with kindof lessadvanced features spectre desktop isalso a great onetwo great recommendations spectre usedto be my favorite now sparrow's myfavoriteyeah um whichmight uh be a good segue for what we'vegot coming up next uh well before we getthereyou can also useyou can also use both the cold card andthe foundation passport with blue walleton mobile so if youare going through the steps and you gotcomfortable with blue wallet alreadyum because you started with a mobilewallet uh you can then use blue walletwith both of those hardware walletswhich is nice especially i mean i ithink some people listening to thisprobably don't have a computer that'sso a lot of people don't have computersthey just have the computer in theirpocketyeah you know we're heading towards amobile first world aren't we if not ifwe're not already there and blue walletdoesoffer a great interface uh especially uhwith with the with the passport with theqr interfaces uh very very slick andvery easy to wrap your head around as abeginnerawesome okay so you want to go to thenext topicyou said yeah let'slet's hit nodes yeah so i talked aboutum inspector desktop and one of thegreat features about like the desktop isit actually has a built-in bitcoin nodeso uh the next step along your journeyuh hopefully will be to look to run yourown bitcoin nodeum a bitcoin node is you can look at itas your umsort of interface into your into thebitcoin world and it's going to be thatnext step along the sovereignty journeyso that you can and again one of the thebuzz phrases that you hear in the spaceis verify your own transactionsand so when you receive uh any bitcointransactionand that will bebeing passed to you via a whole networkof nodesand the wallet that you choose to usewill be connected to a node now thatnode could be uma centralized node or operated by anexchange uh it could bea node that you don't know who existsthat might actually be a chainsurveillance company or hopefully itcould be your own node that you can runum in your house relatively cheaplynow the benefits of of running your ownnode like i said is you can verify yourown transactions so that you can be surewhen somebody's sending you atransaction and that the transactionabides bythe this sort of rule set umthat the the network that you've chosento join umthat we all agree on uh to put that alittle bit simplea little bit simpler is that you canbe sure that sort of nobody's trying tocheat you and send you some fake bitcoinor a transaction that's not valid and sothat you know you might be selling goodsor services and they might be paying youin bitcoin for thatandand if you weren't verifying your owntransactions they might be able to umsend you um the way i like to frame itis it's using your own note to interactwith the bitcoin network you have to usea node and if you don't use your ownnodeumyou don't have counterfeit detection isis like kind of how i like to view itsomeone can kind of trick youuh into it into thinking you havebitcoin when you don't have bitcoin soyou want to use your own node for thatpurpose and then second of all which ithink is almost more tangible to peoplebecause to be honest uh we haven't seenthat's more of a theoretical attack andwe haven't really seen it play out itcould still play out in the future youshould assume it it will so you want touse your own node for counterfeitdetection but second of all it alsoif you don't use your own node um you'retrusting your privacy with whoever'snode you're using so you want to useyour own node so that you don't have totrusta potential potentially a stranger or acompanywith that that private transactioninformation and balance informationyeah it's about removing trustessentially and and by running your ownnode you're you're putting the trust inthe hardware and or the the softwarethat you are choosing to run uh not theone that's kind of been given to you ifyou're operating with an exchange or acentralized node runner and so there'suma a massive awash of choice and withvarying degrees oftechnical abilitythe the easiest way to get running withyour own nodeis to download a piece of softwarecalled bitcoin corethis is kind of the the sort of uh defacto software built by the the bitcoincore developers uh that is essentially apiece of software that you can in acouple of clicks download onto yourlaptop or desktop and and it will startto download the your own copy of theblockchain so that you can umtransact with the built-in wallet andto just to get started and verify yourown transaction that way that'sabsolutely the easiest way and as itouched on earlier uh spectre desktopactually has umessentially that built in as well justpackaged in a slightly different way foryou and so they're they're absolutelyfree and within a couple of clicksyou'll be on the way to downloading yourown copy of the blockchain and havingyour own node set upthe problem with a setup like that isthat umyou i can't really um generally speakingconnect any mobile wallets to it so ifyou were to want to transact when you'reout and about and you run bitcoin coreon your laptopand you wanted to send the transactionthe likelihood is you're not gonna haveyour laptop with you so you you know youwon't be able to to spend as easily assome of the node options that we'regoing to come up come on to uh in asecond i'll just pause see if matt's gotanything to add thereumyeah so i mean if you're using bitcoincore or if you're using the built-inbitcoin core inspectoruh yeah correct your you can't the mainnegative is you can't use it with themobile wallet the also the othernegative isum your transaction and balance infowill be on your computer so if it'sa computer you use for work or acomputer you use uhto play games or look at porn orsomething like that your social mediahabitit might be easily compromised and thatbecomes a it becomes mostly it becomes aprivacy issueumbecause all your transaction historywill be there and all of your balancehistory will be thereum but also you can't use it with mobilewallets which is a key component as wellyeah so so the next best option um andunfortunately the most expensive optionis what's known as a plug and play nodeso this is where you'll buyessentially a small box from one of thevarious teamsto name a few we've got uh ronin dojowe've got raspi blitz we've got startnine uh umbrell there's loads ofdifferent companies or my nodeno nothere's loads popping up um all withdifferent feature sets but essentiallythey sell your boxuh that you plug in at home you plug itinto your router you plug it into thepower outletand then within a couple of clicksyou're off and running again to to getyour own copy of the blockchain and haveyour no your own node up and runningand before we move on uh civil dispatchuhcivil dispatch 26i had all the major node teams on for aconversation ontheir node projects so if you'reinterested in having one of thesepurpose-built boxes or you a lot ofthose projects that were just namedallow you to actually buy the hardwareseparatelyand then install their software on it umconsider listening to that sill dispatchright so and the the kind of finaloption is the diy approach like matt'sjust touched on where all of theprojects that we just said and we'llhave a parts list you can go away andbuyspend a couple hundred dollars buying ahard drive and a single board computerand a couple of other cablesand build your own node and put your ownsoftware well put the software thatthese teams provideand onto that hardware uh the the endresult is that you get um the same nodewith all the same features um obviouslythe caveat is that you've got to gothrough the process of buying thehardware yourself flashing the softwareand onto a micro sd card uh which mightcause you some you know if you're a lesstechnical user and you're lesscomfortable with taking that approachand that's why the teams offer theplug-and-play note it does sound moreintimidating than it actually isand i would absolutelyso like i encourage new users to gettheir feet wet um also juston thejust to go back a little bit aboutbitcoin core i mean if you're using youcan use you can also use bitcoin core ifyou're running bitcoin core on the samecomputer you're running spectre on or asparrow they both can connect to itumif you do that process you really shouldbe using it on a dedicated computer iknow i like kind of touched on thatearlier when i said you know if you'reusing it for playing games or socialmediait could get compromised easier becauseyou're using it for all these othergeneral purposes you're downloadingsoftware on it that maybe you haven'tverified you definitely haven't verifiedand have no idea what's really runningthereum so if you are going to go thatapproachyou should have a dedicated device youshould consider a dedicated computer adedicated phone that you are using withit um and uhyeah in general dedicated devices areare going to be more secure and moreprivate you'rewhen we when we talk about security andbitcoin land whereyou don't don't let perfect be the enemyof good don't get overwhelmed becauseyour setup's not perfect but at the sametime you're just trying toreduce your threats so that you're notthe lowest hanging fruit most of thetime when we see these hacks it'stargeted at the people that are mostvulnerableyeah and the just to go back to the diyapproach that was outlining umall of these uh different projects thatwe've spoken about have got reallyreally good documentation and quitevibrant communities as well uh ontwitter telegram or their own dedicatedforum and so don't be afraid to you knowgo and have a browser the documentationlike matt said it's not actually asscary as i made it sound um and also youknow go and ask some questions in the inthe telegram chat or in the slack orwhatever you know um chat room that thethe the project has gotum you'll probably find or you'lldefinitely find thatall of these the people that are inthese communities are really welcomingand they've definitely been in yourposition before now and and you knowthey they found uh the thought of thisreally scary a couple of years ago andyou know now they might be runningseveral diy notes so they'll be don't beoff-put by it100um i will echo that sentiment i wouldjust add a slight caveat that there arescammers in these telegram groups andthese chat rooms um they will often tryand impersonateuhpeople that are involved with theproject or other notable figures to tryand get you feel comfortable never nevergive anybody uh your seed words thosesecret backup boards never give themtheir secret backup boardsand you know always be skeptical ifsomeone in one of those groups tries todm you separately and tries to go into aprivate chat you know sometimes it islegit but you need to be extra cautiousin that type of situationyeah and and if somebody does don't beafraid to ask in in the sort of mainroom you know tag the person who youthink might have dmd you and said isthat his issue at the mme exactly butalways uh just act on the the on air onthe side of caution and and keep thatsort of adversarial mindset to think youknow why is this person reaching out tome completely out of the blue after ijust asked my first question enteringthe room100um so all those node projectssupport something called electrum serverand electrum server is a standardumit's it's a standard way to interactwith your own node um you can use thoseelectrum server details and then you canput them into sparrowyou can put them into many of the mobilewallets that we mentioned earlier youcan put them into blue walletwith samurai specificallythey don't use electrum server they usesomething calleddojoand with that pairing is as simple asthere's a qr code and you just scan theqr code with your samurai wallet on yourphone and it'll pair up with your nodeyeah the good thing is with dojo as wellis it's uh implemented in the vastmajority of the the note packages nowthere's there's more that have dojo thatthen don't which is really great to seeindeedshould we hit on the coin joinokay soi i just want you know we're we're anhour inum if you're a newcomer you just listento this hour and you're intimidated as uh don't be intimidated you knowstart with step one where we talkedabout acquiring your bitcoinumthen you know learn how to hold your ownkeys and slowly move through the processdon't you know freak yourself out thatyou know now now i gotta run a node toolike i'm now i'm really intimidated youknow step by step get your feet wet getcomfortable send transactions receivetransactions back up your wallet restoreyour wallet just get comfortable with itget used to it don't it's not somethingto be scared of it's something that youlearn by doingyeah i uh i put a tweet a couple ofweeks ago actually that kind of echoesthat that you know if uh sending atransaction uh makes you feel a littlebit uneasy then you haven't sent enoughtransactions um you can see on screenthere that the mempool is uh you knowit's a little bit busy than what it wasbut a couple of sats per bite is goingto get your transaction confirmed veryquickly and that's going to cost you youknow less than a dollar to send atransaction so we don't have we don'thave that on the list but before we moveon to coin join on chain privacyutxo management we should probablyhow does how does a newcomer choose whatfee to pay they open up their walletthey go to send a transactionumwhat like how do bitcoin transactionfees work i feel like that is somethingwe tend to gloss overyeah we overlooked that one um wellfortunately most of the the good mobilewallets especially the ones that we'veuh mentioned uh on tonight's stream uhwill give you a couple of options uhwhere you canum you'll they'll either have you knowthree options sort of low prioritymedium priority and high priority likeagain like we can see on screen or theremight be a slider where you can manuallyadjust the feeand essentially the the higher that thefee you pay the more likely that uh yourtransaction is going to be uh confirmedor processed quickeruh againa caveat with that one we've got a lotof caveats tonight is that umthe uh some of the estimation the feeestimations umthese wallets all use different sort ofalgorithms as to how they um calculateor estimate the fee that would berequired to get you confirmed in thedisplayed priorityso matt's got on screen here a reallygreatwebsite called mempool.spaceum which can it shows you again the thepriority uh fee selections uh or what itwould adviseand based on uh correct me from wronggame map but based on what's currentlyin the mempool um as well as sort ofhistorical data as well so it's kind ofaalways a really good sort of accuratelook at you know if you want to get yourtransaction processed within the nextblock uh right now it would take anestimate of 13 sats per byte um butagain there's a little caveat here thatthere's still umtransactions with much lower transactionfees umthan 13 sats per byte that will also getget confirmed so it's kind of umit's not an exact science uh i will saythatbut multiple sources is always a goodone if you want to try and uhget it sort of nailed so i mean bitcoinis a run by a companybitcoin is adistributed networkum and so as a result how bitcointransactions workiswe have this chain of transactionsand the transactions are within blockswe call them blocksumroughly every 10 minutes there'll be anew bitcoin block and it will havefinalized transactions included in thatblockuntil you get into a blockyou sit in a waiting list that waitinglistis we call that the mempool we call itamenpool technically every node hastheir own mempoolumbut if your internet connection is solidin most situations those mempools shouldall look the same so when you go tomempool.space you're looking at theirmempool that will look very similar toif you looked at the same thing on yourown node which a lot of these nodeprojects by the way allow you to runmempool.space natively with your ownnodesothebasically you have this like free marketthat's constantly going on where you'redecide wherepeople are choosing which fee they'rewilling to spend and miners are going tousuallyinclude you in a block based on yourorder in that waiting list based on howmuch you want to spendso if it's a transaction between someoneyou trust um and you're willing to waita longer period of time you can pay alower fee if you're sending just toyourself you can pay the lowest fee wecall that's one sap per byte is thelowest fee because you're just sendingit to yourselfum you know if if in some crazysituation where a one sapper by nevergets confirmed ever which we've neverbeen through you can always resend thattransactionso you're gonna want touh choose your transaction fee based onthe urgency you want that transactionfinalized on the networkand most good wallets will basicallygive you a low medium and highyou knowthislow being i can wait medium being likei'm in the middle ground because it'smedium and high being i don't want towait i want it finalized as soon aspossibleyeah andit'sit's a very much a dynamic thing it'slike a queue that's always evolvingevery single second because there's moreand more transactions being sent youknow every second andumit's not within you know outside therealms of possibility thatwhat the fee that you put up right thissecondmight not be enough to get youimmediately uh processed into the nextblock in sort of five minutes timeum so it's it's very very dynamic andyou know that's why i said it's not sortof an exact science so generallyspeaking for most people the walletestimators are pretty good especially ifit's an urgent transaction that you needto be processedimmediately100 i'm glad we covered that topicum also uhjust uh before we move on to the nexttopic just to jump backwith hardware wallets uhyou know the backup to that hardwarewallet are those words you wrote downumyou have the option of putting them intosteel these steel plates are availablemany different vendors offer the steelplatesand the idea there is if you put it intosteel obviously it's going to be waterresistant and fire resistant it's goingto be more sturdy than paperyou might also consider makingduplicates of those seed words andhaving them in different places so likeif your office burns down or your houseburns down it's still in the otherlocationwith the caveat that it meansit could be more likely that someoneelse finds it because it's in morelocations so you need to think aboutthat very carefullyand then third of all with hardwarewallets which i forgot to mentionone thing i like to tell new coinersis it's a good idea to have to buy twoof whatever you decide to buybecause if you have a second oneyou canyou can have the same backup wordsinitialized on both devicesso then if something happens to yourdevice not only do you have the seedwords available those those secretbackup words available to restore yourdevice you also have the second devicethat still has access to your funds soyou're not in a panic situationum so i always i tend to recommend topeople that they should buy two of thesame device whichever they choose umso that they they can have twoinitialize and you can keep those inseparate locations as wellif you wantokay yeah i think that's good adviceso when you're opening up a bitcoinwallet it shows a balanceum a common misconception isthatthat you know you just it shows yourbitcoin balance that's what's in yourwallet but in reality what's in yourwallet is basically a bunch of differentbitcoin transactions that all add up tothat balanceum we call those utxos uhthose those are unspent transactionoutputs utxos is what we call them youcan think of them like bills in yourwallet like maybe your wallet you knowyour cash wallet has50 in it but in reality it has two 20sand a 10and that's how bitcoin wallets work soyou have all these small utxos in therethat add up to your balance and that hasprivacy implicationsbecause ififtwo of those utxos come togetherum in a single transaction they'reobviously linked on this chainuh forever right we call it theblockchain it's this ledger oftransactions they'll be linked togetherbecause they were both spent in the sametransactionso that brings us to this idea of utxomanagementand coin control the idea oftrying tomanage thosebitcoin transactions in a privacy andcost effective way should you want to gointo that a little bityeah definitely um and quick i willstart with the two wallets that we keepmentioning blue wallet and samurai umoffer all the features that i'm justabout to cover that sort of help when itwhen it comes to to utxo managementandinspectoryeah sorry yeah i keep referring tomobile wallets but yeah the all of thedesktop uh the good desktop wallets thatwe've spoken about i've all got utxomanagement features as well um sothere's a couple of facets to it thefirst one is the ability to uh label thethe utxos or the pieces of bitcoin thatyou've got in your wallet so what wouldbe an example of a label might be thatif matt was to pay me for dinner uh orpay me back for dinner um when ireceived that transaction into my walleti could put a label on that to say thatthat's come from martin it was fordinnerum i could then receive my wages from myemployerumand i could put the the relevant labelon that just to know that where theorigin uhof that utxo is fromumso the once i've labeled themwhen i'm making future transactionsand i'mthere's two ways you can make atransaction you can let the wallet toconstruct it for you automatically whichthey might choose any random utxos andmerge them together again like matt saidto which will show common ownership thatmight not be a problem however if you uhwant to preserve your privacy and imight not want my employer to know thati'm friends with matt because he's a badperson um because i've labeled those i'mnot a bad person thoughbecause i play radical[Music]because i've labeled those utxos when ireceived them at the time um in you knowtwo weeks down the line when i'm goingto make a transaction um i can then chyou know consider and the person thati'm paying you know do i want them toknow that i know matt or do i want themto know that i work for the company thatpaid me uh with this utxo i can makethat informed decision then to say wellactually i'm just going to spend fromone of those pieces of bitcoin oractually it's not a bad thing matt's notreally a bad person i'm gonna combinethe two uh because the value that i wantto send i need to combine the twoum so those are the two two sort of mainfacets to it and and but obviously youcan't ummake a an informed decision when youcome to spend um if you don't know theorigins of all of the etxos that you'vegot and so they kind of go hand in handreally um you need to label so that whenyou come to spend you can make theinformed decision as to whether youshould merge or not yeah so a key aspectof bitcoin isif someone sends you bitcointhey can see where that bitcoin goes inthe futureand if you receive bitcoin you can seewhere that bitcoin came from in the pastsothis is why labeling is importantbecause you want to knowwhere that transaction came fromor it goes tobecausethat's who you're exposing your privacyto in that situationis that a good yeah installation yeahwhich you know um might not be a problemfor you know the person that i'm payingmight not um be able toor be clever enough to to use blockchainanalysis um but the other sort of umadversary that we need to consider hereis chain analysis firms that might betrying to umcluster or monitor your unchain activitywho you're spending to who you'regetting change back from uh to monitoryour habits to try and um piece togetherumyou know the identity because theblockchain doesn't have any identitiesat that at the blockchain layer um butthese companies work to kind oftie all the pieces together so that theycan um de-anonymize people and so it'snot just a case of umyou know hiding how much you earn fromyour friend uh it's also you know thesemore sophisticated actors that have gotmore a lot more resources to throw atthis and that you've also got to bear inmind as well unfortunately yeah you bothyou both don't want you don't want youremployer to knowwhat you're spending things onand you don't want the guy who sells youa sandwich to know how much money youmakebut on top of that we also have theseprofessional surveillance mercenariesthat work for governments dictators andcompaniesand they are just out there constantlytrying to track bitcoin transactions soyou also have that as a concernwhich leads us nicely onto coinjoin ithink if unless there's anything elseyou want to touch on no let's yep we cantalk about coinjoin now so coinjoin umis um acoordinated or collaborative transactionwhereyou and at least one other personwillcollaborate to construct the transactionthat casts some doubtas to theorigin and the output of the transactionto umto make suream thatstill could you still hear mei can still hear you yes oh sorry ithought i dropped out yes it's acoinjoin is a collaborative transactionwhere umthe the idea is that theuh somebody watching the blockchainagain chain surveillance firm youremployer your friend whoever they can'tumdeterministically orwith good probability be able to trackthepeople on the input side of thetransaction to the output side of thetransactionso it effectively attempts to put upsort of um a brick wall in your you knowthe the utxos history so that umanybody looking on chain can't be sure100umyou know is there one person involved inthis transaction is there 10 peopleinvolved in this transaction it justcasts doubt on the the uh path that thebitcoin has taken and and who sort of umyou know has the bitcoin change handshasn't it we we're not really sure so sotracking bitcoin is a probability gameumthese surveillance companies and theirtools will basically or just someonewho's curious and trying to spy on youum will basically assign a probabilityto every transaction if ownership haschanged because one of the things aboutbitcoin isyou know i could send bitcoin to myselfor i could send it to bitcoin q a anduh the chain doesn't delineate betweenthat so a key aspect of tracking bitcointransactions isumdetermining some kind of probabilitythat bitcoin actually changed hands andthen from there trying to seewhich hands it went from from who to whoum so coinjoin is this idea of acollaborative transaction and you canthink of it likeumjust for an example if you have fivepeople that are doing a coin jointtogetherinstead of uh having a simple path thatyou're following on chain and decidingif ownership has changed um all of asudden there's five different potentialpaths it could go downyou don't know which of the five peoplethat participatedwhich of their five outputs are themso it breaks that probability chainand it's a useful tool in terms oftrying torecr to have forward privacy have thisidea of someone who sent you bitcoindoesn't necessarily know which path yourbitcoin took going forwardyeah and specifically with umimplementations of coinjoin likewhirlpool which are known as equaloutput coin joints um the the the sortof notion is that everybody um on theoutput side all of the utx on the outputside of the transactionlook absolutely identical and soit's kind of uh i always like to use theanalogy of v for vendetta where you'vegot the million mask marchit's essentially the same thing but onthe blockchain where all of these utxosare indistinguishable from one anotherand so like matt said you've got someforward privacyand be quickand soi the the three major coin jointprojects our samurai whirlpool joinedmarket in wasabiumcitadel dispatch 15 was with the wasabiteam civil dispatch 16was with the join market teamand civil dispatchi don't know where he is i also did asamurai oneum is citadel dispatchit's there in your feed somewhere youknow uhstefan can just rattle them off he knowsexactly which one is which always amazesme that umi don't know which one it is i'll comeback to it and tell you but it's there'sthere's another dispatch with thesamurai team so if you're interested inthis uh consider going back andlistening to those threeumme and bitcoin q auh like samurai whirlpool the best youcan also you you don't have to usesamurai walla with it you can usesparrow wallet with it as wellumyeah yeah co-sign that samurai orsparrow a hands-down win is for me umespecially from a from a beginner'sperspective um definitely the easiestones to get started with in my opinionyou can continue on i'm trying to figureout which dispatchi'lli'll cover off one quick question that'sum quite on topic and somebody askedwhat's the difference betweenum coinjoin that we've just spoken abouton a coin tumbler so the unfortunatelythe words uh or the the meanings havebeen kind of umwhitewashed somewhat over the years butum generally speaking a coin tumbler isa centralized service where you willhave tosend inyour bitcoin and give up a custody of itto whoever's running the tumbler andthey will send you somebody else'sbitcoin backand i absolutely wouldn't recommendanybody use thesebecause you're putting yourselfum completely in the hands of whoever'srunning the tumbler and that you knowwhether they're going to send you yourbitcoin back or notand yeah soand you also not only you're trustingthem with your bitcoin if you use acustodial mixer it's the same ideas ascustodyum because custodial risks with walletsum you're also you're trusting them withyour privacy and your fundsum so the key aspect of coinjoin is isthe idea that you are reducing trust inany kind of centralized third party umwasabi and samurai have a centralizedserver that they doum[Music]that they use to coordinate the coinjoins to make them easier better uxuh and more reliablethose coordinators are blindedwith samurai specifically you can use itwithout your own node and then you'retrusting samurai's node so that goesback to our earlier conversation aboutusing your own node you should use yourown node when you use samuraiotherwise you are trusting them withyour transaction and balance informationas as is the case with all light walletsum i found it so so it's still dispatch15 is wasabi still dispatch 16 is joinedmarket and still dispatch 30 is samuraiso consider listening to thoseokay i think are we done on coinjsshould we move on to the next topic um ihave multisig as the next topic butshould we do lightning real quick firstsure thing yeah yeah i think it's apt umsoquick high level on what the thelightning network is uh it is a scalingsolution for bitcoin that umallows you toum transact with uhactual real bitcoin um but you don't doso with what's known as an on-chainfootprint and so it allows you to sortof lock up a small amount of well asmuch bitcoin as you want onto thissecond layer solution known as thelightning networkso that you can umyou essentially just defer the theoverall settlement um of any number oftransactions from going on chain to toreduce fees and also to allow you totransact um much quickerso whereas uh one on chain transactionyou know might cost you a couple hundredsats depending on the fees and you youmight be able to send you know 10or even 100lightning network um transactions forthe sameuh for the same amount of fees um nowthere is uhunfortunately lots of caveats with thelightning network again in terms ofbeing able to do it properly uh with uhthe best way to do so be with one of theuh no packages that we've spoken aboutbefore andwhich will dictate that you need tomanage your own sort ofyour own channels which is essentiallywhere you lock up this bitcoin to beable to to transact on this second layerumso it's a little bit more of a hurdle toto get on board with um but you you sortof can save yourself a fair bit on feesespecially if we ever see a feast bikeagain um which i think is inevitable umthe i don't knowinevitable um sofirst of all there's been a lot ofdispatches on lightning if you gothrough the feedconsider listening to those there's likea lot of different caveats and nuanceswhen using lightningspecifically with privacy i did a fullprivacy episode with openobs and anthonythat's still dispatch 21 that's onlightning privacyuh so consider checking that out but themain differentiation that you as a newuser should think about with lightningis going back to our transaction feeconversation earlierwhich iswhen you use a regular bitcointransactionyour transaction fee is not based on theamount you send it could be kind ofweird for youuh it's it's actually based on theamount of utxos that you useuh for the transaction it's based on thedata size not the amount of money thatis sentsoyou could end up sending a five dollartransaction with bitcoin on chain aregular bitcoin transaction and it couldcost the same as sendinga five million dollar transactionnow with lightningit's different the way fees arecalculated on lightning is based on theamount you're sending so that'll be morecomparable to something that you're usedto in traditional finance world where ifyou send more money you're going to paya higher fee you send less money you'regoing to pay a lower feenowuh moon wallet with 2us as we talkedabout earlier mobile wallet supportslightningand blue wallet supports lightning nowif you use blue wallet in its defaultstate with lightning it's going to be acustodial walletwhich i don't loveuh if you insist on using it use it witha small amount because they can takeyour funds you are trusting them withyour privacy um ifuhyou can also use blue wallet withsomething called lnd hub which some ofthese node projects offeri think umbral and my node offered idon't know who else offers it but if youuse it with lnd hub or your friend's lndhub then it's not custodial with bluewallet it's custodial with who's everrunning the lnd hub so if you run thelnd hub yourselfthen it's not custodialotherother lightning specific wallets onmobilethat you can use so moon does bothblue wallet does boththen there's lightning specific mobilewallets that are very good uh there'sphoenixwallet uh there's breeze walletumbreeze b-r-e-e-zcontinuing the bitcoin naming scheme ofusing words and spelling themdifferently um is there anotherlightning wallet that i'm missinglightningeclair as well haven't youwell claire is phoenixphoenixyeah why do they have two okay but yeahboth of those are good yeah one allowsyou to manage your own channels and theother one does it for youokay phoenix does it for youyepokay so forget eclair your new corneryou have phoenix and you have breezewallet or you can use moon or bluewallet and that'srather than for savings you should thinkof that more asokay this is like my spending wallet mytransaction fees are based on the amounti send i'm going to be sending smalleramounts umso i i might use lightning rightyeah i agree i'm quite a big fan ofphoenix um especially from a perspectiveof you know one that a wallet thatmanages the channels for you and i mightget a lot of for this in the chatbut i'm i'm a firm believer that mostnew users don't shouldn't strive todive head first into lightning withtheir own channels because it's it'sit's not easy it's not approachable andeverything that we've already discussedum in terms of holding your own keys umuh using coinjoin and and not using kycare far more important than uh strivingto get your own channels up and runningum quickly uh i don't know what youthink about that matt and i'm waitingfor the in the chat no i mean ithink i i i think umlightning on mobile uh with the walletswe just mentioned moon blueum breeze phoenixfor smaller spending amountsuh is very accessibleuh actuallyif you if you actually want to dolightning in a proper sovereign wayum that i would say is a more advancedthing don't get intimidated by it but ii think it's important for ourall-encompassinggetting started guide that we do mentionit it exists and what are the you knowdifferent trade-offs basically thetrade-off there is a little bit you'regetting less security uh you're gettingless reliability with lightning umbut you're getting lower feesfaster transactions all else equalum[Music]and it could be very useful in a mobilespending type of situationyeah i agreephoenix and brees really great ways toto get started with lightning that havesort of their own unique um trade-offsuh that kind of give the the best ofboth worlds from it from a new userperspectivewhen you compare them with umcustodial solutions like the defaultblue wallet or running your own channelsand that's one of theyeah i mean that's one of the reasonswhy i like moon so much like moon with2us has like different tradeoffsum it doesn't have a standardized backupprocessuh it's you know if if you'rea lot of big corners will say it's youknow not a lightning wallet but at theend of the dayit's not a lightning wallet because youstore all your funds on chain you're notstoring it in a proper lightning walletum but what's cool about moon isif you scan a qr code it could be alightning qr code or it could be aregular bitcoin qr code and it justautomaticallyfigures that out for youum and and vice versa yeah so so you canjust have you can have some spendingcash in your moon wall at muunand whatever whatever bitcoin qr codeyou scan it will send but it doesn'thave power user features it doesn't havethat coin selection that we were talkingabout with utxo management it doesn'thave labelingit doesn't have a standard backupprocessso these are all things to keep in mindright multisig multisig let's let's gohere's where we get into the weeds alittle bit um right so you've been inthe weeds for a whileall of the uh wallets that we've spokenabout umthe desktop wallets mobile wallets alloperate umon what we colloquially call a singlesig setup where they have um a singlesecret or backup um which is requiredwhen you want to spend your bitcoin amulti-sig wallet is where you combinetwo or more of theseseparate wallets together to create abrand new walletwhen you set up this multisig wallet youcan dictatethe minimumamount of keys required to be able tomake ato sign or authorize a send transactionso that could betwo from a possible three keys is apopular one all the way up to somethingelaborate like 11 or 15 you know whichmight be uh used in sort of a businesssetting props um but two of three whereyou need two signers from a possiblethree that were created to that we useto create the wallet to sign off on anytransactions from that wallet so whywould you want to do that wellwith a single sig wallet and some of thethree theoretical attack vectors ifsomeone's to someone but somebody was tosteal your deviceand and umwhile you know if they snatch your phonewhile it's out of your hand and you'vegot your wallet unlocked um they cansteal your bitcoin if that was one ofthe keys in a multi-sig wallet where youneeded two to spend from then they can'tsteal anything from youumanother one of the attacks that multisigprotect from is known as a retirementattack where there might be a malicioushardware wallet vendor thatdoesn't publish their source code um andthey umhave some uhmalware baked into into the the into thedevice and that is actually uh has theability to stealyour bitcoin i will say again correct meif i'm wrong game out but that has neverhappened again it's a theoretical attackbut if you were to use um a multi-sigsetup where you've got differenthardware wallet manufacturers if one ofthose is is maliciousum they can't get access to your fundsbecause they don't have you know if it'sjust one key out of two that arerequired they don't have the uhthe minimum number of keys required tosteal anythingall the goodall the good wallets all the goodhardware wallets are open source sotheoretically open source meansthat the code is available for you toverifyum and you can read the code line byline nowif you're a new coiner you're probablyup to this point you're already reallyintimidated you're like matt i can'tread codei'm aware okaysoat the end of the dayit is very good that you're able totechnically verify the code but mostpeople will be updating their hardwarewallets and they will not be verifyingthe code so there is some trust that youare you're trusting that hardware walletmanufacturer to not ship uh maliciouscode to you and you're also trustingthemuh that that the actual device wasn'tcompromised when it was first sent toyou right so with multisig the idea isyou can have multiple but specificallyin a hardware wallet ida hardware wallet multisig the idea isyou can have multiple vendorsuh that aremultiple different hardware wallets thatcome together to form your walletandyou needa combination of them as bitcoin q a wassaying a common one is two of three youneed two of them to spend the fundsthis reduces trust in any specifichardware wallet manufactureryou also have the added benefituh that those backup words instead ofthose backup words being aumone and done situation if someone findsthose secret backup words we call themseed words if someone finds those wordsthey have access to your funds in amulti-sig setup you haveummultiple sets of backup words and theyhave to find the required threshold ofbackup wordsin order to spend your funds so ifyou're using a two of three you're gonnahave three sets of backup words you'regonna have three hardware walletsthose backup boards obviously can be onsteel as we said earlierum and you can have them in differentlocations so bitcoin gives you bitcoinwith multisig gives you this uniquesituationwhere you can have a geographicallydistributeduh security setup where you're holdingyour own coinbutthethe the keys to access it can be locatedin different places they can beduplicated you can keep copies of themin different places and for someone toactually compromise you and take yourfunds they're gonna need to have accessto a combination secretwe lost bitcoin q a about two minutesago or a minute and a half ago and i'mjust gonna keep talking until hereconnectssothat is the main benefit of multisig[Music]do not once again do not get intimidatedhereuhplenty of people store bitcoin in singlesig uh setups it is thenormal way of setting it upum this is something you might graduatetouh multisig ux multisigumi guess ux can be kind of a complicatedwordlike the way you interface with themultisig walletis a relativelynew thing in bitcoinumso it it has a little bit more of alearning curve it is a little bit morerough around the edgessoyou want to get really comfortable withit as i said earlier you want to bebacking up restoring spending receivinggetting comfortable with it separatelyof your single sig setupnow one cool aspect of multisigis that you canactually have a single sig walletuh so you can be using a hardware walletthat is single sig and then you cantake that single sig and you canactually also use it in a multi-sigenvironmentandit can be one signer of for instance thetwo of three in the multi-sig but alsoit could also be its separate walletum andi guess the main advantage thereumi guess there's two main advantagesthere first of all if someone findsyour single sigback up your your secret words uh itmight have some small amount of funds onit and they think that's all your fundsthey they can't tell that it's in amulti-sig setupumso they might just take that funds andthink they took all your bitcoin umthis thesecondary benefit isthat you know you can repurpose thesethese hardware wallets and use them formultiple wallets now one other caveathere is with multi-sig you do want toback up additional information besidesjust your seed wordsumbitcoin q a came in and then left againso i will continueumthe popular multi-sig softwaresparrowspectre supports it blue wallet supportsitthey will tell you what you need to backup and make sure you save all thatinformation now that informationthat additional information that's notyour seed words umthey will have terms like derivationpathum descriptorthe list of something called x pubs youdon't necessarily have to know what allof that means you just have to save itand you just have to realize thatwhileseed words area security risk if someone gets yourseed wordsthat information that separateinformation that you have to back upwith a multi-stick wallet is a privacyrisk so if someone finds that they cansee how much you're holding in themultisig but they can't necessarilyspend itbut you need that information plus yourbackup boards in order touh to spend your funds bitcoin q are youbacki am apologies for that that'll happen ithink it's my networkno worries at all um i just continued onand i just kept talking about multisigdo you be holding it downumii get i mean i think we arei i think i sufficiently explainedmultisig tradeoffs and and benefitsumshould we move on to mistakes commonmistakesyeah did you cover sort of thealternatives to doing it yourself themultitec approach no i didn't that'sgreat why don't you go into thatyeah so obviously matt's just outlinedsome of the potential pitfalls withdoing it yourself umso one of the other options is known askind of collaborative custodyalternatives where um there will be acentralized service uhsome examples are on chain capital anduh casaumwhere they will help you coordinate amultisit quorum and where they hold oneof the keysand so that in the event that you wereto umso i'll give you an example you'd have akey on your mobile phoneyou'd have a key on a hardware walletand one of theseservices will hold the key as wellso they only have one key so they can'tsteal from you which is greatumbut if you were to lose say your phonewhat their key or the key on yourhardware while and he didn't have itbacked up they will be able to step inas a third party to help you move yourbitcoin so that in a doomsday scenarioand you um you don't lose your lifesavings which is really greatyou will pay for this service and againi'm not sure on how much each charge thebottom tier i think is just over 100umlast time i checked per year and one ofthe the trade-offs with this is that umunless you sign up uh without yourpersonal information which i believe isquite difficult to do umthethese uh centralized um entities thathold the key and part of yourmulti-sitcorum they know who you arethey know how much bitcoin you hold inthat wallet because they hold one of thekeys and they alsohold the sort of uhthe wallet file if you like to put itsimply and so that they canjust as a kyc exchange can umbe able to tie you to your bitcoinidentity so it's worth paying up thetrade-offs yeah and you're using theirnode sothe assumption is if you do this if youuse one of these providersuh you're trusting them with yourprivacy but they will hold your hand andthey will have a spare key for you aswellum and they will help you onboard intothe process they will help you gethardware wallets they will go throughthat whole process but you are trustingthem with your privacy they know yourtransactions they know your balancesandin 99 of situations they know who youare as well uh they'll know the ipaddress of your of your devices that youconnect fromthis is all kind of getting a little bittoo much into the weeds but the key isthat you're trusting them with yourprivacyum i was explaining earlier justbasically doing it yourself so you coulduse your own note and you aren'ttrusting someone in that situation youcan still haveumother people hold keys for you so abitcoin q a started with a two of threesetup because that's a very common setupbut another common setup is a three offive setup and if you do a three of fivesetup you have five total keys and youneed three to spendsoif you need three to spendyou can hold three keys yourself so thatyou know you have and you put them indifferent locations and you know youhave enough to spend it yourself butthen you can also have you know a familymember a frienda lawyerholdhold a key you can have differentcombinations of people hold the key soit can be very useful inum[Music]specifically in in situations whereyou're trying like inheritancesituations where if if you pass away youhave large bitcoin savings uh you knowmaybe a lawyer is holding one in a trustmaybe a couple family members areholding individual ones and theybasically all need to collaboratetogether in order to spend your funds ifyou have three keys with other peopleum but you can also do it in a way whereyou don'tyou don't they never have the thresholdthey need to compromise you pluscombined togetheryeah i think umjust one final thing before we move onto the next topic um inheritance is abig one for me that um i i sort of liketo drive over people who seem to seemkeen to kind of jump into the diyapproaches thatyou know you might have spent some timelistening to some podcasts watching someuh tutorials or reading some guides andfeel comfortable in setting up amultisigumsetup um but what happens if you're notaround tomorrow unexpectedly uh is yourspouse your next kin are they going tobe able to coordinate a spend from a twoor three or a three or five do they knowwhere to find the keys do they know howto recover it and if you answer no toany of those questions then uh all ofyour life savings disappears when youdisappear soand something to bear in mind especiallyif you're going to take the diy approach100 i'd also add that there's a middleground hereuh specifically supported by cold cardcalled seed xor and basically in thatsituation instead of having one seedit's not multisig but instead of havingone seed you have two seeds and you needboth of them in order to spend yourfundsso it's a little bit different thanmulti-sig it can be more accessible topeople uh because you don't have theseadditionalcomplications that we were justdiscussing with multi-sigbut it gives you that benefit of nothaving a single seedbackup wordsthat can be compromised by someonethere's also something that's supportedby pretty much every wallet out therecalled a passphraseand in that situation you have thesebackup boards are usually 12 wordphrases or 24 word phrases thepassphrase is the 13th word or the 25thword and you pick that yourselfso if you do that method then you cankeep the passphrase separate from yourbackup words if someone wants tocompromise you they need access to bothumand i mean if it's a weak passphrasethey might just take your backup boardsand keep trying pass raisesumbut it it adds an additional umburden on them to try and compromise youwithout going through a multi-sig setupum anotherinteresting thing about passphrases isyou can store money on the bear backupwords and then you cannot when you use apasswords it's a separate wallet soin that situation you can actually keepfunds on youryour basic backup boardsand then if someone finds that they'lljust steal those that money and theymight not know you have a passphrasewith the majority of your savings in itum so that's just something to keep inmindawesome do you want to cover off uh somesome common mistakesnext on the listyeah i think common mistakes is a goodspot to go nextuh so i've got quite a lengthy list hereandthe first one of which unfortunately iuhfell fell prey to a little bit um andthat is uh it comes back to our veryfirst pointof cape kycmultiple exchanges and without any realneed to really um so i've just uh sortof expose myself to you know put my nameon loads of different databasesand soit's an unfortunate one that you can'treally undo like we spoke about beforeand if you were to you know listen tothis podcast and decide that youumstill want to gofor a kyc exchange because you think youknow the task of going uh no care adviceandtry and limit your umyour exposure to this by just signing upwith one reputable exchange umi think that's a good one to start anddid youi think that's very good advice like ifyou are going to use a kyc service whereyou're providing your identityinformation you should choose itcarefully you should choose someone youtrust the mostand you shouldnot sign up for a lot of people justsign up for a ton of different servicesyou should only you should sign up forthe bare minimum ideally if you're gonnado it you sign up for oneyou use it solely just to buy bitcoinand then send it to your own walletsumand and you don't you don't use anyother additional kyc services you wantto limit that as much as possiblesecond thing is did you change your micsetup at all because it's way worse nowthan it was beforeuhhello i changed my computer um i'll havea player how much while you're talkingnow turn up is it just quietno we can hear you but it's just likebreaking up a little bit it's likecutting in and outall right i'll let i'll play aroundumanother common mistakeuhthat i see people make isi i mean gambling on coins so a lotof people will think that um bitcoin istoo expensive and i've missed the boatand i i'm too late to bitcoin umliterally every single person who hasentered bitcoin at any time in bitcoinhistory has thought they were too latethere's like a famous screenshot ofsomeone on one of the bitcoin forums uhlamenting that they didn't get in atfive cents and instead they got in at adollar and they were too late and theymissed the busum so everyone feels that wayuh you're not alone in that it'simportant to realize that you cantransact insmaller units of account we call themsatssoyou can you don't have to have a fullbitcoin you don't you don't you don'tneed like right now bitcoins at almost70 thousand dollars you don't need toput 70 000 and to use bitcoin uh satsare the smallest unit of bitcoin there'sa hundred million of themper bitcoin andright now sats you can get 1500 for adollar so you can send any amount ofsats you want to send you can send twodollars worth you can send 25 centsworthumit doesn't matter don't get caught up inin in thinking that bitcoin is tooexpensiveuhwhat common thing that these other coinswill dois they make it so they have so manyunitsthat it seems like it's cheaper than itis just to try and get you in the doorit's a it's a marketing tactic so justkeep that in mind uh q are you thereyeah how's my mic now oh so much betteri'm glad i brought it up perfect okay doyou have more common mistakesuh yeah common one um is just notpracticing umenough with transacting uh testing mybackups for my hardware walletstesting different wallets even usingtest net just practice practice practiceand getting comfortable uh using the thevarious tools that we've spoken aboutandgetting comfortable with it either usingtestnet which is basically uha copy a carbon copy of bitcoin that'shas that holds no value you can get itfor free onwebsites called faucets where you can goon and just mimic the normal behavior ofa walletand without the fear oflosing any real value and so you cansend some test net bitcoin to to your hardware wallet and youcan wipe it recover itand just to get really reallycomfortable with with that process sothatif um the worst was happening and yousomething was to happen to your houseuh where you say bitcoin wherever youstore your coin andyou're when you're in that packed stateit's not like the first time you touchyour hardware wallet for five yearsbecause you you know you've done thatyou know people call practice so you'vegot this lots of time if you send realvalue in there but it'sconnected to you and because you know ifyou're in a panic and you you need tomove your bitcoin quickly the last thingyou might be doing is doing itin unfamiliar uhsituation or in a familiarsituation wherebecause that's when mistakes happen andyou could uh muck something upyeah so we see that happen a lot whereyou know peopleuh so i actually don'tespecially for newcomers i don't know ifyou need to use testnetum it adds just anothercomplication to your processumbut but what happens a lot is likepeople will buy bitcoin they'll send itto a hardware wallet they never reallyuh get comfortable with itthen bitcoin goes up in valuesignificantly and like four years laterthey're trying to spend it and they'rejust not comfortable at allso you really want to get comfortablewith it you want to practice sendingreceiving backing up and restoring umand just you know i don't think testthat's necessary in that situationbecause you should just do it with thesmall amounts you knowuse you know send five dollars back andforthuh erase the wallet restore it from yourbackup see that your five dollars arestill thereum one nice thing about my earlierapproach that i mentioned if having twoof the same hardware walletis without putting funds at risk at allyou can load up one hardware wallet withsome bitcoinand then you can restore iton your second hardware wallet you canload up those secret words onto thathardware wallet and if your funds arethere and you can spend them then youknow you did the backup and restoreprocess correctly without actuallywiping the original wallet so that'sanotherbenefit you're basically verifying yourbackup and restore processyou don't want to be in a situationwhere you have a lot of moneyandyou have a lot of money on the line andyou've never done a backup you've neverhave you've never done a restoredprocess and you're just freaking out andmaybe you wrote down the words wrongi've had that happen to friends wherewe've had to guess the word that theythey wrote down wrong or wrote down inbad handwriting um so you don't youdon't want to be in that situation youwant to practice practice practicei think just to add to that uh backupprocess as well is thatmost of the umor the hardware wallets that we'vetalked about this evening havemultiple different types of backups aswell so i think it's worth noting thatpractice using both of them as well sowe've got the the siege words umboth call card and passport alsoofferingbackups as well where you can store itbackup onto a micro sd card um which is alittle bit easier to store and so iwould urge people to practice restoringfrom both methods as well becauseat the end of the day if again if in adoomsday scenario you don't know whichmethod of backup you're actually goingto have access to or which is survivedwhatever um you know doomsday scenariohas actually happened100um before we move on to more commonmistakes we have alex mccluskey in thechat asking about 401k ira fundsum if you're trying to hold bitcoin in aa in a in a tax beneficial way in yourretirement accounti would just keep this very simple uh ifyou do haveuh a 401k or an ira where you alreadyhave funds in it and you want to movethem into bitcoinjust consider using uh the serviceoffered by unchained capital that'sunchained.com disclosure they are asponsor of ofmy other show rabbit will recap thisshow does not have sponsorsumbut they're a sponsor becausethey're a good team it's a good productumi have friends there that are workingthere my buddy jeff andrew runs theirtheir retirement division and they willhold your handthey will help you through it obviouslyas we said earlier the caveat is you'retrusting them with your privacyum but pretty much in all situationswith retirement funds if you're using atax beneficial retirement uh methodyou're going to have to trust someonebecause it's all getting reported to thegovernment as wellthe nice thing about what unchained doesis you hold your own keys so you getthat tax benefit um but you're holdingyour own keys they can't spend yourfundsa lot of the other programs that are outthereumcan can spend your funds at will and youhave to trust them completely with thesecurity of your funds and your privacyso just something to keep in mindyeah the next one umfrom me is kind of a little bit moreoutside of the box umi lurked around on on bitcoin twitterand in some of the communities uh for alot longer than i really should have umwhen i started to uh interact with withpeople in the you knowwallet chat rooms or the no chat roomsand to use a few examplesmy knowledge grew exponentially fromthen onwards from having thoseinteractions versus me just sitting onthe sidelines and kind of you knowliking a few tweets every now and thenso if i was to go back and kind of havemy time again i i'd absolutely startgetting involved and start contributingand to the conversation much muchearlier because uh personally speakinganywaymy my knowledge just uh you knowskyrocketed compared to where i was justa couple of years ago and so big one forme that oneyeah that's uhand uh i just i think like learn bydoing right practice with small amountsumand get your feet wet rather than feelintimidated and feel like you have toread everything and listen to everythingand watch everything uhbefore you even get your feet wetyeah another one as well is and and mattmight roll his eyes at this one is iskind of going publicumthere there's a lot of value in instaying in the proverbial shadow so tospeak um i would urge people you knownot touh sort of start shouting from therooftops uh that they own bitcoin againbecause you know we talked earlier aboutkyc and how we kind ofcan paint a sort of red cross on yourback a little bit well shout from therooftops um when bitcoin hits anall-time high to all your friendsand might uh inadvertently do the samething one day um you know yeah 100 alittle bit jealous you never know he'sgoing to get jealous andtell somebody else you tell somebodyelse who'san individual that might want to try andget their hands on it soum i would be be candid about who youwho you speak to bitcoin about and it'sa bita double-edged sword that one because uhi think we've all got a little bit of apersonal responsibility to try and helpon on board others as well so um alsosay just kind of be selective about whoyou speak to it and what you sayyeah it is um it might sound a littlehypocritical coming for meum as aas as a as a public bitcoin figureumbutdefinitely in the beginning you shouldnotyou should you should not be talking youshould try and reduce how much you talkabout bitcoin don't make it obvious thatyou own bitcoin don't post on socialmediauh consider using a name like bitcoin qa does i mean it might surprise you buthe wasn't born with that namehe decided on that name himself for theinternet for his bitcoin workumin the future if you do want to becomemore public about ituhyou can do so in a moreresponsible wayum rather than doing it right in thebeginning you can never come back fromit once you do itum so it's something to keep in mindyou should never talk about your ownbitcoin you should never talk about yourown how much bitcoin you haveumthese are best practices uh you don'tyou don't uheven if it's a friend or a family memberit might seem like small amount todaybut in the futureuh it could be a large amount and theywill not forget it they tend to rememberone of the first questions mostfriends and family will ask you is howmuch bitcoin you own they love askingthat questiondo not answer it explain why you don'twant to answer it for themumif people do know you own bitcointhis is where that multi-sig setupreally shines because you can have itgeographically distributed you can haveyour keys in different locations um thatare far away from each other that makeyou getting compromised more difficulteven in a physical attack situation andobviously it is more ideal to live in aplace where you haveum proper gun rights and you can defendyourselfumso these are things to considerum if i was to do it againi probably would not be uh you know aspublic as i am about bitcoin um i made ajudgment calllater on in my bitcoin journey that ifelt we needed more public bitcoinfigures that were talking about realissues and specifically privacy um so imade that judgment call but there aresome mornings that i wake up and regretitumbut there are precautions you can takeand there are benefits though to beingsemi-public about your bitcoin usage uhmeeting people i've met some of the bestpeopleyou know i have i have basically i havefamily now that wouldn't exist otherwiseum but these are all things that youshould considerum as part of your bitcoin journey butin the beginningvery very very stronglywould sayyou know keep keep it as discreet aspossibleum you never knowyou knowyou you don't want to expose yourself toa malicious actor your government couldturn on bitcoina foreign government can use thatinformation against you uh if you'retraveling across a border or somethinglike thatso you you want to keep this in mindyeah the final um sign off one for me umwould beuhi just completely got out of my brainuh what is another two fa is another onea good one to touch on i think um yeswould be um if if you and it's just comeback into me now so i've got two tofinish off um if you again listen tothis podcast decide that no kosc is notfor you and you want to sign up for anexchange and a lot of these exchangeswill prompt you to use uh sms-basedtwo-factor authentication to um i'musing air quotes here to secure youraccountum this is where you'll get a textmessage to when you try and log into theto the exchange they'll send you a textmessage to authorize that login um therehave been multiple umuhinstances where this has beenexploited people have had theirinformation and their accounts hacked onthese exchangeswhich if youunfortunately have got funds on thataccountcan be withdrawn to whoever's got accessto your account they can withdraw it totheir own walletanda better alternative and would be to usean app-based uhtwo-factor authentication so an examplewould be umthere's one called anduh there's one called a edgiest uhthere's another one called um help meout here matt i've drawn a blank umuh did you say agesyeah i said aegis yep aegis is myfavoriteany app-based one and far more secureand there's been far f well aegis isopen source aegis is open source uhthat's a e g i s and the backup processis very easy you got to remember whenyou when you use these authenticatorapps umif your phone dies you want to make sureyou have a backup of themso yeah the most popular one is googleauthenticator and it's notlast i mean i haven't used it inmaybe six years or something like thatbut previously it wasn't easy to back upso make sure you're using one that iseasy to back upand back it up and keep multiple copiesyeah or the other alternative is you canget umlike a physical device that acts as yourthe second factor authentication lookslike a bit of a usb key that providesthe the additional authorizationbut less services tend to umoffer compatibility with those100umi i would say i think for most peoplethe physical device is overkillum can a sophisticated attackercompromise a phone base two factoruh yesum have we seen any widespread cases ofthat no do they still need your emailand your password yes umon that note you shouldn't be using thesame emails and the same passwords indifferent placesum if you go to haveibinpone.com you canput your email address in and it'll tellyou wheneveruh database gets leaked with your emailor your password or your personalinformation um so that's a veryimportant resource but but what we see alot of times is like there'll be like aleaklike maybe facebook will get hacked andthose emails and passwords will then beused at all the other services to tryand get into your accountum so that two-factor code gives you anadditional protection on top of that butyou really shouldbe trying to limit reuse of emailaddresses and never reuse passwords umyeahuh yeah there's one in the chat scoobysnacks asking is a password manager agood idea yes definitely would recommendit to anybody my personal favorite isis bit warden again another free andopen source uh software they do offer apaid version as well but the thefreemium uhoption is perf is perfectly good enoughfor for uh 99 of users i would sayyeah bit warden's great um you justgottaif you're using a password managerum there's some nuance there because ifyou're not self-hosting your passwordmanager you're using awhat's the main onelastpass people love lastpassumit's closed source you're kind ofputting all your eggs in one basketuhso there's some concern there you knowif you if you have all your passwords inthis password manager and that passwordmanager gets compromised then all ofyour accounts are compromisedumwhat i think is like a veryuh easy accessible thing forumnew users or people that are concernedis is your really important passwordsyou can just write them in a notebookyou write them in a notebooksomeone's going to need to get access tothat notebook physically in order tocompromise youumyou might not want to write it outcompletely clear you know maybe somethings you remember versus some thingsare on the paperyou can develop your own like kind ofcode system don't over complicate ityou'll probably forget the passwordum[Music]but uhpaper and pen paper and pen is a triedand true methodyeah absolutely and then just don't putit on athe final one that went out my headbefore um waswe've spoken about uh you know there's alot of information the past couple ofhours umdon't try and uh do everything in thespace of a week especially if you areliterally at step one um i would sort ofpick one of these topics you know wespoke about them in aumin a specific order for a reason and iwould urge people to sort of start fromstep one and try and master each stepbefore they move to the net before theymove on or at least not try to do toomany of them at the same timedepending on the approach depending onthe the approach that you take for thedifferent tools that we've we've spokenuh you know to do it properly and to doit justice and to understand it andpractice it like we've been like we'vebeen sort ofreiterating it's gonna take you you knowum a good bit of time you're gonna haveto dedicate some time to do this and tomaster some of these tools so trying todo too much too soon is setting yourselfup to to fail so take your time uh beum deliberate about it and and sort ofmaster something then move onyeah and our i that's great advice andas bitcoin q a said our order in thisepisode was intentionalso don't feel like you have to gothrough all the steps at once butgo throughthat order was how we we we chose thatorder specifically because we think it'sa very um[Music]efficient effectiveuh managing trade-offs and stuff balanceof what order you should kind of becoming into this um we also have someperson in the chatum who uses the nim some person so everytime i call him out in the chat i soundlike i'm just don't care about his nameuh asking for the best a two-factor appfor ios i really like authenticator plusfor ios users um i think it's availableon android as well but if you're onandroid i really just like aegisumso yeah there you go for that answerum i have on this list bitcoin q a ihave common questions do you have commonquestions that you have in mind orum i've got nothing noted down but kindof umoff the top of my headum a common one that i get is sort of uhis umis this setup good for me or is thiswallet the one i should useuhyou know insert service or or tool hereyou know is this goodum it's the thing with bitcoin and andusing the tools properly that we've beenspeaking about is thatwhat matter i might recommend from ourown personal experiencesmight not be perfectly applicable toyour own personal uh throat metal threatmodels or skill set um soagain we we have kind of covered thisground a little bit earlier but is umjust try things out um you know by i'mnot saying don't come to the people imatter myself and ask for advice youknow we're always um more than happy toto to help out um but the best thing todo is to sort ofget your hands dirty and try these toolsyou know you can do it for for free orfor a very low fees at the moment andjust testing out wallets or or differentdevicesor multi-sig setups if you want to gothat far coinjoin implementationsumbest thing to do is get your hands dirtyget get amongst the communities and youknow what's perfect for one person mightnot be perfect for another so umit's a bit of adyor do your own research and getcomfortable with what's going to workfor you really100 um just to reiterate umbitcoin q a has all of his guides atbitcoiner.guideumi have a list of resources and tools atcivildispatch.comhelpat the top of civildispatch.com help ihave also i have links toboth bitcoin q aummyselfand our buddy katan from australia whoruns ministry of nodes offers uhwe offer private one-on-ones and there'slinks to all of that at the top

katan uh for that and that's whythey are at the top of that pageumi thinkuh narwhal tacos has an interestingpoint i i kind of touched on it but ifelt like it was a little bit too earlyin the episode so i didn't go heavy intoitumhe's asking have you explained that noone actually holds their sats in a wallat just the key it took me a while towrap my head around thatthat is absolutely correctum you're not actually storing yourbitcoin you're storing the key thatallows you to access and spend yourbitcoin um so when we talk about allthese wallets when we talk abouthardware wallets and mobile wallets it'sreally uh either piece of software apiece of hardware that is that isstoring that secret key for you andallowing you to easily access that soyou can access your bitcoin um i thinkthat's an important point but i i do iwould say thatthat's almost more of ai don't know i i feel like it's more ofan advanced thingfor all intents and purposes you cankind of operate under the assumptionthat you're holding your bitcoin in thewallet butum it is a good it is a good point thankyou narwhal tacos um i think with allthat said it doesn't seem like we haveuh any any additional questions in thelive chat i would add that obviouslythis is still dispatch 43 there's been42 other episodes filled with contentum well that's a lot more advanced thanthis so if you want to dive into thatafter

bitcoin onapple pay here's what he saidit's something that we're looking atit's not something we have uhimmediate plans to douhfori would sort of characterize it as thereare things that i wouldn't dolike umuh our our cash balancei wouldn't go invest that in crypto uhnot because i wouldn't invest my ownmoney in crypto but because i don'tthink people buy an apple stockto get exposure to cryptoand so if they want to do that they canthey can uhuhyou know invest directly in crypto orthrough other meansuh and so i wouldn't do thatand i'm i'm not planning to in theimmediate future to take crypto for ourproductsas a as a mean of tender uh but thereare other things that we're definitelylooking at like whatuh like i wouldn't want tohave anything to announce todaywell let me ask you a different questionbecause you just said that you might notdo it personallydo you own crypto in any bitcoin orethereum would you play around with thisi i do yeah i think it's reasonable toown it as a as a part of a diversifiedportfolio and i'm not giving anybodyinvestment advice by the wayso[Music]happy bitcoin tuesday freaks it's yourboy matt o'dell here for anothercitadel dispatch the interactive liveshow

it's all encompassing from startto finish new new bitcoin are cominginto the space trying to do things youknow the right way trying to do thingsin a secure wayumand and just have it all in a singleepisode have it all in a singleconversationso as i was saying earlier the writerdies that are in the live chat um if youhave questions put your questions in ifif you're not a beginner and you'relistening in and you think we missedsomethinguh feel free to put that in the livechat as well and just a reminder thelive chat is accessible through thetwitter twitch and youtube streams andthey all getfed into uh the main chat so with allthat said i'd like to introduce bitcoinq a how's it going bitcoin q ahey matt it's going good thank you forhaving me back on uh it's been a while ithink um episode number two was now withthat with ergo so uh yeah lookingforward to getting back to it and uhrunning through some some of thebeginner-focused uh stuff that seems tobe missing from some of the podcasts uhfloating around me to tend to get jumpinto the weeds pretty quickly sometimesdon't we yeah i mean i have a feeling weare going to also be jumping into theweeds but we're going to try and do itin a nice constructive path into theweedsyeah i need you to keep me uh keep me incheck on that onebut yeah you are a dispatch lg it hasbeen it's been a minute and uh we'vewe've both been through a loti like to see like to think that we'vebeen through it together and uh yeahjust uhlove that you're back joining us and youknow i hope it's you know not just thesecond time it'll be many more times inthe futureumso with all that said freaks uh we havea bit of a structure that we set up forthis episode which is unusual fordispatch but i think it'll keep usmore focused um and so we're going tostart withactuallygetting bitcoin for the first timeum so do you want to you want to startwith that bitcoin q ayeah so uh it's buying bitcoinsnever been easier than it is todaythere's uh exchanges popping up all overthe place every every man in this dogseems to beuh giving you the opportunity to to beable to buy bitcoin from within theirecosystem or their appumthe the kind of elephant in the roomunfortunately and uh is is the um knowyour customer or kyc is it's uh it'slovingly called within the spaceumkyc is a regulation that essentially anysort of businessentity that has a banking relationshiphas to abide by that kind of dictates umthat they must collect certain pieces ofinformation from anybody that they givea service to obviouslyin the context of bitcoin that's anexchange that sells you bitcoin fordollars pounds yen whatever yourjurisdiction isumso in practice that looks like if youlike go on the cash app and you try andsign up to cash app to buy bitcointhey require you to upload your id youraddressuh i'm not sure some some servicesrequire like a selfie um that's whatwe're talking about right here which isthis identification information that'srequired when you sign up to one ofthese regulated servicesright and some of these are some ofthese exchanges now are even doing uhvideos where you they take that like a3d scan of your face which is kind ofscary really andso with all that said why why is thatkind of um why is that sort of a badthing that that people like matt andmyself sort of try andumwarm people away from or at least paintthe dangers clearly for everybodyeverybody um so when you supply thisinformation to to be able to buy bitcoinin a you know a really sort of easy andstress free way you know cash apps agood example where you can just in acouple of clicks get some bitcoin into awallet that you controlbut one of the main problems is that youknow all of this information getsrounded up into a centralized databasethat's controlled bythe entity that you're doing businesswithum unfortunately these entities or someof these entities they won't toureverybody with the same brush um don'thave a great track record of uh securingit effectively umtalk about perfect timing we we heardabout um a hack with uh robin hoodyesterday was it it was seven millionusersseven million users uminformation has been leaked um nowthere's varying degrees of the severityof the leak some of it's just emailaddresses uh some of it's more personalinformation like banking details etcumyou know to name a few others equifaxfacebook t-mobile clubhouse linkedinuh coinbase ledger um all of thosecompanies umrequiresome form ofof your personal information to to dobusiness with them and and they've allhad hacks where again with varyingdegrees of severity that um somebodythat shouldn't have got their hands onyour information did so i'm you knowwhat we're not talking small fry heresome of these uh hacks were in to thetune of millions and millions of ofpeopleum now you know if that's something likefacebook and your uh email address getsleaked you know it's not really the endof the world it might piss you off alittle bitwhen you tie that into umsomething like bitcoin wherehopefully especially after you'velistened to this podcast and you're sortof securing your own wealth that mightbe uh in your house that might be in aloved one's house or a combination ofthoseif uh if if the wrong person was to gethold of this information you know yourselfie your home addressum indicate in the case of coinbase howmuch bitcoin you've actually boughtthat is umessentially painting a very large crosson your front door that ummight make it inviting to the wrong typeof people to come and pay you a visit tosee if they can relieve you of of thosesatsso that's one of the main umyou knowuh reasons that that i personally tryand sort of make people aware that yesgoing on to cash app or coinbase orwhatever is is you know they make itreally really simple they've got reallynice polished uis to to be able to goand umget some get your hands on some statswithin it within a couple of clicks umit'syou know one of the big big risks isthat this information is leaked on aregular basis and there are companies inspace that to their credit and haveyou know they've nev never umbeen fallen prey to one of these attacksand but unfortunately they do seem to becoming um more and more uh frequent umso yeahthat's one of the main risks with kyc soyeah i mean i would add a couple thingshere uh first of all even if you know acompany hasn't been compromised yet weshould basically operate under theassumption that they will be compromisedin the futureumthis information once it is taken isoften soldto other people as wellit can be combined with otherinformation that was leaked from otherdatabases so for instanceumif you know you you have the facebookleak and the facebook leak has yourmailing address in it and then you havethe ledger leak and your ledger leak hasyour email address in it but thefacebook link also had your emailaddress in it they can combine those twouh leaks to get your full email addressand your actual in-person addresssecond of all we've seen umwe've seen physical attacks happen topeople who were known bitcoiners and howmuch bitcoin they had uh sometimes itwas because of these leaks it's hard totell for sure sometimes it's becausepeople just talk about their bitcoin andhow much bitcoin they own which you alsoshouldn't doumthird of alluhthis information can obviously be usedagainst you by your own government itcan also be used against you by foreigngovernments in the future obviously itis painting a target as you are someonewho owns bitcoin and uses bitcoin andexactly how much bitcoin you haveuh and then fourth of all in thecoinbase league specificallyumall of your withdrawal history was alsoleaked so uh it can be used to trackyour future bitcoin transactions uhbased on that information and we will gofurther in onon bitcoin privacy and trade-offs ofbitcoin when using bitcoin trying to useit privately how to go about that inlater on in this episode but these arejust things to keep in mindright so you know all of which is issort of incredibly scary um and theother thing final thing odds aboutbefore we sort of look onto thealternatives is that you know umsomething that i like to sort of keep inmind and remind people is you knowbeing here for number go up is great youknow i'm not going to sit here and saythat um i don't like to see us hitall-time highs all the time um butbitcoin is also umcreated to be able to make thetransactions that they don't want you tomakenowif you're sort of uh tying all of yourbitcoin to your personal identity umyou're you're kind of putting a inyour armor before you've even startedthat you know if you do want to makethose purchases that umbitcoin allows you to make um due to itspseudonymity thenyou're sort of starting two steps backby tying your your bitcoin holdings toyour personal identity um which is wheresort of buying from a new kyc source itcomes in so that you can have umsome or hopefully you know in a perfectsituation all of the bitcoin that youownso before we get there before we getthere just one more thingkycthese records are forever once once youdo these records you have to assumethey're foreverum is it best practice to delete anaccountum i you know if you're no longer usingit yes but you should assume that actualdatabase record hasn't been deleted umand it might be used against you in thefuture um so these are things to keep inmind umnow let's move to okay so if you'retrying to avoid kyc you don't want touse one of these regulated services whatare your optionsright so the the sort of uh two mostcommon ones that kind of get bannedaround in terms of actually purchasingbitcoin um is bisque uh which is apeer-to-peer uh decentralized exchangewhere you essentially it's a maker takermodel where somebody will want to umsell some bitcoin and they will go on tobisque and they'll say you know i wantto sell uh x amount of bitcoin for thismuch um you know 500 whatever and andthen you as a buyer can go on to thatsort of uh peer-to-peer marketplace andand look for these offers to see onethat sort of fits your bill that youknow was is within your price range andyou know the amount that you want to buyyou can go on completely and honestanonymously and and sort of take theirtheir sell offer so that you can buythat amount of bitcoin from themumthis isbisqyep so it's an application that you justdownload onto your computer basicallyyou run it all locally uh you knowthere's no personal information youdon't need to show any id's to sign upthe only person again depending on thepayment method that you use you knowthere's many many payment methods umsome are better from a privacyperspective than others and but let'ssay you knowmost people are going to go on and andif they want to sort of be able to takea wider range of offers from you knowmore people across the world they'regoing to want to use the banking systemwhich you know might ring some alarmbells to some other people listening butumwhat also i say is what's worse issharing your banking information withone person who is very likely to wantvery likely to be a privacy preservingindividual because they you know theyprobably wouldn't be using bisqueotherwise versus uh the regulatedentities that throw all of yourinformation into a centralized honey potthat we've just explainedum so that's one way you know some ofthe more private options that areavailable on bisc umare sort of postal money orders whichyou know i don't really know great dealabout um because it's a u.s centricthing um but you've also got cash in themailand then there's various various otheroptions that are kind of uh relevant totheir sort of jurisdictionsumanother option as well is huddle huddlewhich worksquite similarly to the way i've justdescribed with bisc and the thedifference being is a huddle huddle iskind of a centralized company um thathosts uh the sort of buy and sell uhlocations for you you know it's awebsite huddlehuddle.comum where you can go and sort of makeoffers or you can take offers again inthe same fashion umso so there may be some uh other alarmbells are in game where thinking whereum well what happens if i go on tobiscor to huddle hollow um and i youknow take this buy offer and i sendsomebody some some you know us dollarsand what's to stop them from just neversending me the bitcoin so both of theseservices um work on what's called anescrow system where the seller will haveto deposit the bitcoin first into amulti-sig wallet that is controlled byum by the buyer the seller and the sortof centralized entity um so thatbasically they theyuh can't sort of run off uh once they'veyou know got hold of your dollarsbecause they have to deposit the bitcoinfirst and and you'll be notified to waituntil you send any of the payments sothat they've proved that they've sort ofdepositedthe bitcoin into that um there is stillsome risk there but it's a reduced riskyeah absolutely you knowit's kind of i would say it's more of agrief and attack than ayou're not really at risk of losingfunds it's more of a um going throughthe arbitration process to prove thatyou've sent the dollars so that you getthe bitcoin back in the end so it'sgonna be more of a headache more than arisk to to actually lose any uhany cash would you sayyeah more or less umsoyeahcontinue so some of the other options umif youuh you can buy from bitcoin atmsthere's a really great website calledcoinatm radar.comwhere you can go on and punch punchingyour physical location i would recommenddoing sousing a vpnand and it will tell you all of thebitcoin etms thatare in your local area the the generalpremise of these is that you uh walk upyou can deposit some cashuh give it a um bitcoin address uhhopefully from a wallet that you controlwhich we're going to come on to laterand the bitcoin will be depositeddirectly into that wallet that youcontroluh there are again as is always the casewith bitcoins from caveats um justbecause you're depositing cash doesn'timmediately make bitcoin atm superprivate depending on the umthe brand of atm machine that you usesome of them do still ask for id um butthat is uh distinguished on the websitei've just said which is callingatmradar.comright some ask for id and thenand then some ask for just a phonenumber some ask for bothyeah which and obviously the the onesthat just ask for the phone number arethe better ones because you can spoofthat with services like textverified.comwhere you can just get kind of a burnernumber uh to satisfy the atm's umuh you know phone number requirementsbut obviously that's not tied to to yourpersonal identityum and then before we continue before wecontinue since we're still like early inthe episode and i should have mentionedin the beginning uh bitcoin q a has uhmy favorite guides in the space so ifyou want to look up somethingspecifically or if you prefer readingum if you go to bitcoiner.guidehe has all of his guides listed there sojust keep that in mind okay continueyeah pretty much everything that we'retalking about i've got some uhsome form of information on it um soyeah moving on to other noko i seeopportunities um so we've covered uhpeer-to-peer peer-to-peer exchangeswe've covered atms and the the next sortof option is to uh is to earn it umwhich might sound a bit outlandish tosome people are new and entering thespace but also we'll say is thatumeverybody has some form of a uniqueskill um and there's always going to besomebody who needs umwhat you can offer them uh it's justabout sort of uh trying to build up abit of a reputation whether that's inyour local area or online and so thatyou canyou knowsell your time or your skills andknowledge um and receive satsin in in repayment for themand the other option again probably notas much of a beginner optionas i would like it to be but the otheroption is to mine itumalthough home mining does seem to begoing through somewhat of a renaissancewhich is really really great to see andso the the general premise of that isthat you canbuy a bitcoin miner you can plug thatinto your um outlet at home plug in anethernet port connect up to to a miningpool and stream yourself somesecret sats or some private no kyc satsuh directly again into your wallet thatyou control umthere's been you know a fair bit of foodbanded around that home mining is iskind oftoo difficult or it's too expensive umthe the thing i would say is that yeahit's very much dependent on yourelectricity prices um but again you knowthis this shows fairly us centric andthere's a lot of places in the u.s whereyou know and if you'reum earning anywhere less than i thinkyou knownails in the chat they'll probablycorrect me on this but i think you'reprofitable mine at the moment anywherebelow 30 sats 30 shots yeah so i meanwith with all of these techniques youmight be spending a little bit moremoney than you would beum if you went through one of theseregulated services um you'rethe way i justify it is i mean you'reyou're paying a little bit of a premiumfor privacyand you're paying that for privacy goingforward too so it keeps paying dividendsuh with mining specifically mining homemining is a fantastic wayuh in my opinion ofaccumulating kyc free setsumit's really nice because once you haveit plugged in it's just constantly goingyou don't even have to really thinkabout it just constantly bringing inmore sets um we already have two wholemining umcivil dispatches so if you go back ifyou go to civildispatch.comor if you go through the podcast feed orif you go to bitcointv.com and ourplaylist over there you can find thoseepisodes and we're about to have a thirdone too uhi think november 30th there's gonna be athird home mining episode so if that'ssomething that interests you you shouldgo check those out uh starting with thefirst one uh because we literally spentlike three hours on all the differenttrade-offs thereyeah just to come back on on somethingthat you said about um generallyspeaking you're absolutely right thatyou're gonna pay uma little bit more for uh noko ac satsyou know especially if you go to thepeer-to-peer exchangesum but i just i like to try and reframeit and you know it's not a a no kycpremium and the theprice that you see on a kyc exchange ilike to call it the um the discount thatyou get given um for giving up yourpersonal information and puttingyourself uh a little bit more at riskthan versus uh getting some sats thatare not tied to your identity so i thinkthat's like that useful framing yeah thereal price is the private way and thenexactly discount if you sacrifice yourprivacyum and then one method that you didn'tmention which isprobably the most uh accessible to newcoinersis if you have a friend or a couplefriends that are interested in bitcoinand they've been in bitcoin for a whileum obviously if you can if you can paythem cash for some of their bitcoinum that is the most private uhi wouldn't say the most private but it'sdefinitely the most accessible privateway for a new coinerand if they if they don't want to sellyou any they might know someone whowants to sell some soum that's always something to keep inmind cashin person isextremely gives you very good privacyguarantees periodumwhat else also like if you knowto the to the bitcoiners out therelistening to this uh showum you know guide your new cornerfriends in throughthat kind of method right and whether ornot you want to actually explicitly sellit to them that's one thing butyou know if you if you go out to dinnerhave them pay for dinner with their withtheir cash or their credit card and thenpay them back in bitcoin orgive them you know birthday gifts inbitcoin and like get them started in apeer-to-peer fashion rather than justthrowing them to the wolves and sendingthem to a regulated exchangeyeah there's a couple of people in thechat that have just uh rightfullyshouted out um as techo vouchers as welland which is essentially uh you'll getsort of stores uh that sort of sign upto become an azteco um sort of vendorand you can go in hand over some cashand you'll get sort of a voucher whereyou can go and claim the the equivalentamount of sats from that again directlyinto a wallet that you controlthe the the other caveat the sorry theonly caveat with azteco is that thethe sort of uh kyc responsibility if anyis put onto the specific vendor so itwon't just be you know don't justpresume that because there's an articleum vendor near you that it won't be nokyc uh each one is sort ofuh left to kind ofcome up with the their owninterpretation of whether they need todo it or not basicallyand you have that major chain in you inthe uk that's an azteca vendor rightwhat's the name of thatit was poundland but then it stopped acouple of months ago and it's showing nosigns of coming back unfortunately uhokay so as they realized what was goingon they're like ah we can't too muchliabilitywhich was a shame because they they havea store in literally every town therewas hundreds of them and it was massivefor the uk but yeah unfortunate to knowmore okay well that's a shame um if youwant toread more aboutthe dangers of kyc you can go to bitcoinq a's website no kyc only dot comumhowever you decide to proceed withobtaining bitcoin and accumulatingbitcoinum the next step istrying to secure it uhsecure it well and secure it in a waythat you don't have to trust a thirdparty uh who can seize your fundsum so how shouldhow should bitcoiners how should newcoiners go about that bitcoin q awhat are their optionsthe natural uh first step for mostpeople unfortunately like we've justsaid is is um a centralized exchangeagain like coinbase cash app or someonesomething like thatwhere you will go on deposit dollars oryour local currency they will uh sort ofcredit your account with you know theequivalent amount of statswhat you have there is um an iouwhere you've got an account with themwhere they say that you've got this muchbitcoin essentially what you actuallyhave in real terms is uh well it's aniou and you don't actually hold anybitcointhe the sort of uh very essence ofbitcoin is the uh that you know thatgoes to say you're not your keys notyour coins which is banded around a hellof a lot and for good reason and itessentially means that if you're notholding the keys for your bitcoin uh youdon't actually have any bitcoinso you bought someone in exchange um thethe next step would be to get yourselfum a mobile walletwhere you can uh generate the keys uhwithin that wallet um so that your youand only you are in control of uh any ofthe bitcoin that you send to that walletum so before we before we move on andi'm sorry that i keep cutting you off ii hope i hope it's uh fine with youbefore you move on umso so the risk is if you're holding itif you're holding it in one of thesecustodial wallets which is what theexchanges default toum and there's some other services thatalso are custodial walletsumbasically the telltale sign of that isthe way you access it is through ausername and passwordumyou don't have any backup yourself whathappens there is there's a highlikelihood that your account could getfrozen we've seen that with paypal inthe past with fiat with just us dollarswhere paypal will freeze your accountand you're not able to get your moneyum it could be stolen if the exchangegets compromised or the custodial walletgets compromisedum and obviously you're trusting yourprivacy completely with the custodianbecause they know all of yourtransactions and your current balancesso it's not idealum and you want to learn how to holdbitcoin yourself becauseone of the revolutionary things aboutbitcoin is that you can hold it yourselfin a way thatumsomeone has to physically compromise youuh to to take your bitcoinum soi guess you're about to start withmobile wallets i think mobile walletsare the most accessible way getting awallet on your phone basicallyum to hold your bitcoin for you rightyeah just before i get down to themobile wallet it comes back to the pointi made earlier about censorshipresistant or being able to make thepayments thatum you know you want to make not thatthey give you permission to to make umif you've got to uh ask for permissionfrom an exchange to be able to sendbitcoin to your desired destination umyou know you're asking for permissionand you know that's not why we're herewe want to be able to spend our money towhoever we want whenever we want sofirst step and the easiest step is toget a phone wallet you know they're freethey're easy to access you know you candownload from any popular app store orquite a lot of them offer umdirect downloads so that you canuh download from the the you know thechosen teams umwebsite or or github umthe a lot of people tend to rush in andtry and buy um you know the next besthardware wallet straight away whenthey've just bought sort of 100 ofbitcoin to dip their toes in a littlebitwell if you you know if you're justdipping your toes in to see if thisthing's uh working for you then itdoesn't make any sense to you know goout and buy a hardware wallet and thisis coming for somebody who works for ahardware wallet company um it doesn'tmake any sense to go out rush out andbuy acouple hundred dollars on a hardwarewallet when you own less than that inbitcoin so that's why you already have aperfectly good phone that you carryaround with you it's very easy to spendand receive fromum but the important thing here is thatyou use a reputable mobile walletthere's a lot of scammy mobile walletsdon't just open up the app store andsearch for bitcoin wallet you will get alot of bad options thereyeah the the unfortunately the the top10 um results for that sort of search inmost of the app stores are quite abysmalmy personal recommendations would besamurai wallet if you're an android useruh or blue wallet or if you're an iosuser uh moon wallet is also another onethat i know you're pretty bullish onthat as well yeah both blue wallet andmoon wallet that's with 2us m-u-u-n areavailable on both android and iosumthey'rethey're very easy to use for beginnersuh i i would say they're not veryintimidating umso don't be intimidated you shoulddownload one just try itso the the kind of general premise ofthese and unfortunately i mentioned moonwallet there it's gonna umit's gonna book the trend of what i'mabout to say but the general premise isyou'll download the app from your chosenlocation uh the the app when you set upa new wallet the app will show you alist of 12 or 24 words which is yourmaster secret um you know which is thethe master backup to your to yourbitcoin wallet anybody that gets theirhands on that and be that physically ordigitally um is going to be able to takeall of your fundsso make sure that you write that downand secure it somewhere um safe andthenso moon wallet has a different backupmethod um it'll prompt you and explainhow to back up that butwe will focus on this standard which issomething we call seed words which isthey're basically these wordsit's a phraseand the wallet generates it for you andyou need to keep them secret youabsolutely need to keep them secret soyou don't want to put them on aninternet connected device you put themon you don't want to like save them inyour icloud notes folder you don't wantto take a screenshot and upload it toicloud what you want to do is at thebare minimum you want to write it downon a piece of paper double check thatyou wrote it down correctly store itsomewhere securely because if someonegets access to it they have access toyour funds but as long as you have thosewordsyour phone you could drop your phone inthe toilet it could fall you know itcould fall and crack and break or justcompletely justyou know some phones just like stopworking sometimesas long as you have those seed words youcan reinstall the app on a new deviceand just put in those words put in thatphrase words and you will have access toyour fundsyeah and the beauty of that is like yousaid most of the you know 99 of thewallets umin the space all sort of work to thatsame standard so you know you wouldn'tnecessarily have to even uhdownload the exact same mobile wallet aslong as the mobile wallet that youchoose umit abides by the rules which again mostof them do then you can sort of put thatseed phrase into into any other walletand there's a quick question in the chatwhich i think is probably good to touchon before we move on to hardware walletsandsomebody asked how much would you needto own to get a hardware walletnow obviously i'm not going to be ableto answer that for the for everybodythat that's watching you know it's quitean individual questionand all i would say is you knowif it's yourthe only mobile wallet you've gottenit's on your daily phone i would use theequivalent of how much cash would youphysical cash would you carry aroundwith you um you know what's your limitat which it's gonna start um affectingyour life if you used to lose thatbalance umthe quick review the mobile wallet themobile wallet should be like almostconsideredis is like your spending wallet what youwould have right inin in your back pocket but uhgoing further when we go into moremethods of storing your bitcoin thatwould be more like a savings accountum except i you're about to say a caveatuh i mean i have my own caveat i wouldsayi thinkespecially if you're using a reputableonei think people can feel a little bitmore comfortable than the kind of amountof cash they would carry in their pocketum i know like i wouldn't feel morecomfortable i wouldn't feel thatcomfortable carrying more than like 400in my pocketum but like a mobile wallet especiallyif it's your first wallet you're justgetting started you're gettingcomfortable you have your seed wordsbacked upuh your phone's up to dateyou know we don't seehacks are theoretically possibleobviously phones get compromised all thetimeumbut i i would probably if i had to picka number i'd like being like the 5 000to 10 000 rangelike that's where you start having toreallyconsider securing it moreum and you should also operate under theassumption because bitcoin tends togo up fastumyou should be prepared ahead of timebecause it could beyou know it could be a thousand dollarsin there and then in six months it couldbe worth eight thousand dollarsyeah the the other thing i would say aswell is that thisalmost everybody has got a spare phonelying around at the house that you knowyou could use that as your sort ofdedicated bitcoin phone and where youcouldbe slightly more comfortable storing youknow maybe larger amountsrelative to the individual and and thenyou could kind of decant off into yoursort of daily phone what you might wantto spend on a day-to-day basisabsolutely nothing wrong with thatapproach as well if you didn't want toand shell out quickly for for umfor a hardware wallet which we can wecan come on to now and so hardwarewallet is well before we get to hardwarewallets you also havethere's also software wallets on on thecomputer that you can haveright so you have mobile wallets youhave software wallets on your computerwhere it's like you install an app onyour computerumi i mean i would saylike unless you're an advanced user andyou have like a dedicated computer andthis episode isn't for advanced usersthey should probably shy away from thatin the beginning i i think the mobilesecurity model is a stronger securitymodel as you know as long as you're notworried about like the nsa or somethingum or like the chinese intelligenceservicesor these intelligence services um mostmost of the population uh are not greatat securing their their computer uh mostpeople's computers are unless you'resort ofa bit of a hacker man there's this youknow a far more vulnerable device thanyour mobile phone iswhich is why like you said you know icompletely agree that i don't recommendthem especially for larger amounts umand i tend to sort of skip straight tothe hardware wallet after the mobilewallet stageumsohardware wallets um are essentially adedicated uh physical deviceum designed to manage the the keys thatcontrol your bitcoin um so with thembeing a a physical dedicated device youknow their one purpose is to secure yourbitcoin whereas your phone hasyou know it's essentially a computer inyour pocket and with all of that extrafunctionality that your phone hascompared to a hardware walletincreases the theoretical attack vectorswhere hackers orthe nsa whoever can umsort of try and attempt to get theirhands on your bitcoin so these devicesare very focused andthey're focused at securing your bitcoinfrom physical attack um and also uh fromum digital attack ie uh you knowsomebody stealing your keys um over theinternet if you were to connect one ofthese devices to your uhvery likely highly insecure computerumso they a lot of them most of the goodones um work uh you know that theirprimary umway of of sort of keeping things secureis that they operate with what's knownas an air gap where they they canoperate without being connectedphysically to to any other device andbecauseit's that physical umconnection that sometimes can introduceuh uh intro um extrathreat factors so the the idea just todistill it here like the idea of ahardware wallet is that you have aa device that's builtto securely hold your bitcoin welltechnically it's holding the keys toyour bitcoinum butfor all intents and purposes it's it'syou can think of it as holding yourbitcoin and and it interacts with eitheryour computer or your phone in a waythat those keysall the keys are what protect yourbitcoin gives you access to bitcoin andyou don't want someone else to haveaccess to those keys it keeps those keysoff that computer or off that phone soit stays on the deviceand that device is never connected tothe internet sothethe basic concept behind securingyour stash with a hardware wallet isthatuh for someone to compromise you theyneed to physically have access to youand the device orif they can compromise the device justthe device but they like have to comeinto your home or come into your officeand get that device rather than hackingyou through the internetright and you know the even um if ageneric attacker was togain physical access to to most of thesedevices and they're still going to um afair bit of time and a hell of a lot ofequipment to be able to um you knowcrack theum protections on the device to be abletoaccess the keys um and to be able tosteal your bitcoin so it's not just acase of umprotecting you from a malware infestedcomputer um if somebody was to break inthere's still pin protection on thedevice and so it's not just a case ifyou lose the device um and you loseaccess to your bitcoin again the thepremise that matt spoke about beforeabout writing down your seed words um isexactly the same with a hardware walletuh the differences here is that um thethe when you sort of uh generate thosethose 24 or 12 words and it's done in anoffline environment that's never beenconnected to the internet so that againit just removes that extra threat vectorwhere um you're not connected to anysort ofinternet connected devices so it's justthat extra layer or wrapper of securityperfectumshould wewhat is your favorite hardware walleti saw that one coming a mile offum so full disclosure um i work for a umhardware wallet manufacturer calledfoundation devicesand obvious biases aside i genuinelybelieve that we make the umthe best option for a beginner enteringthe space umit's incredibly secure but also veryeasy to operate uh so i should havenamed the devices called passport andand another great device is the callcard umwhich is probably looks a little bitscarier to the newcomer i would say umbut has some extra features um thatmight bemore beneficial for more advanced usersthat they could sort of leverage sothose would be my two favorites yeah iwould say my favorite is uh cold cardumi've used multiple versions of coldcards i highly recommend them umand then ifwe're not really going to go intocoins here but if youabsolutely need to gamble onother coins in the space rather thanjust bitcoin uh both foundation and coldcard are bitcoin onlyumi mean so i i would say either use aledger or a treasureuh hardware wallet if if you wantcoin support um but even in thatsituation you probably shouldgo with a bitcoin only hardware walletfor your bitcoin and then use the otherones for your coins and just likethe mobile wallets there are lots ofreally bad harder wallets out thereso don't just googlebest hardware wallet because a lot ofinfluencers are paidtopromote them so you'll see youtubevideos with 500 000 views saying to usea horrible hardware wallet soconsider thatyeah what i would say just to back thatup again is that you know likelihood isif you're listening to this that you'reat least aware um ofyou know bitcoin twitter and the peoplethat are umaround and popular on there and most ofthose people have been around for a goodnumber of years and they've probablytried all of these devices so look towhat most most of theirmost of those people are using or atleast recommended and when you're sortof doing your own research to see whichdevice is going to be best for youperfectumwhen they're using their hardware walletthey need to use it with awith software they need to use it withan appso what are your recommendations forwhich apps they should use with theirhardware walletthe best two for meif you want to stay on desktop whichgenerally gives you sort of a little bitmore extra functionality would be numberone be spiral wallet um hands down myfavorite umor if you like a little bit of a sort ofeasier to to operate interface with kindof lessadvanced features spectre desktop isalso a great onetwo great recommendations spectre usedto be my favorite now sparrow's myfavoriteyeah um whichmight uh be a good segue for what we'vegot coming up next uh well before we getthereyou can also useyou can also use both the cold card andthe foundation passport with blue walleton mobile so if youare going through the steps and you gotcomfortable with blue wallet alreadyum because you started with a mobilewallet uh you can then use blue walletwith both of those hardware walletswhich is nice especially i mean i ithink some people listening to thisprobably don't have a computer that'sso a lot of people don't have computersthey just have the computer in theirpocketyeah you know we're heading towards amobile first world aren't we if not ifwe're not already there and blue walletdoesoffer a great interface uh especially uhwith with the with the passport with theqr interfaces uh very very slick andvery easy to wrap your head around as abeginnerawesome okay so you want to go to thenext topicyou said yeah let'slet's hit nodes yeah so i talked aboutum inspector desktop and one of thegreat features about like the desktop isit actually has a built-in bitcoin nodeso uh the next step along your journeyuh hopefully will be to look to run yourown bitcoin nodeum a bitcoin node is you can look at itas your umsort of interface into your into thebitcoin world and it's going to be thatnext step along the sovereignty journeyso that you can and again one of the thebuzz phrases that you hear in the spaceis verify your own transactionsand so when you receive uh any bitcointransactionand that will bebeing passed to you via a whole networkof nodesand the wallet that you choose to usewill be connected to a node now thatnode could be uma centralized node or operated by anexchange uh it could bea node that you don't know who existsthat might actually be a chainsurveillance company or hopefully itcould be your own node that you can runum in your house relatively cheaplynow the benefits of of running your ownnode like i said is you can verify yourown transactions so that you can be surewhen somebody's sending you atransaction and that the transactionabides bythe this sort of rule set umthat the the network that you've chosento join umthat we all agree on uh to put that alittle bit simplea little bit simpler is that you canbe sure that sort of nobody's trying tocheat you and send you some fake bitcoinor a transaction that's not valid and sothat you know you might be selling goodsor services and they might be paying youin bitcoin for thatandand if you weren't verifying your owntransactions they might be able to umsend you um the way i like to frame itis it's using your own note to interactwith the bitcoin network you have to usea node and if you don't use your ownnodeumyou don't have counterfeit detection isis like kind of how i like to view itsomeone can kind of trick youuh into it into thinking you havebitcoin when you don't have bitcoin soyou want to use your own node for thatpurpose and then second of all which ithink is almost more tangible to peoplebecause to be honest uh we haven't seenthat's more of a theoretical attack andwe haven't really seen it play out itcould still play out in the future youshould assume it it will so you want touse your own node for counterfeitdetection but second of all it alsoif you don't use your own node um you'retrusting your privacy with whoever'snode you're using so you want to useyour own node so that you don't have totrusta potential potentially a stranger or acompanywith that that private transactioninformation and balance informationyeah it's about removing trustessentially and and by running your ownnode you're you're putting the trust inthe hardware and or the the softwarethat you are choosing to run uh not theone that's kind of been given to you ifyou're operating with an exchange or acentralized node runner and so there'suma a massive awash of choice and withvarying degrees oftechnical abilitythe the easiest way to get running withyour own nodeis to download a piece of softwarecalled bitcoin corethis is kind of the the sort of uh defacto software built by the the bitcoincore developers uh that is essentially apiece of software that you can in acouple of clicks download onto yourlaptop or desktop and and it will startto download the your own copy of theblockchain so that you can umtransact with the built-in wallet andto just to get started and verify yourown transaction that way that'sabsolutely the easiest way and as itouched on earlier uh spectre desktopactually has umessentially that built in as well justpackaged in a slightly different way foryou and so they're they're absolutelyfree and within a couple of clicksyou'll be on the way to downloading yourown copy of the blockchain and havingyour own node set upthe problem with a setup like that isthat umyou i can't really um generally speakingconnect any mobile wallets to it so ifyou were to want to transact when you'reout and about and you run bitcoin coreon your laptopand you wanted to send the transactionthe likelihood is you're not gonna haveyour laptop with you so you you know youwon't be able to to spend as easily assome of the node options that we'regoing to come up come on to uh in asecond i'll just pause see if matt's gotanything to add thereumyeah so i mean if you're using bitcoincore or if you're using the built-inbitcoin core inspectoruh yeah correct your you can't the mainnegative is you can't use it with themobile wallet the also the othernegative isum your transaction and balance infowill be on your computer so if it'sa computer you use for work or acomputer you use uhto play games or look at porn orsomething like that your social mediahabitit might be easily compromised and thatbecomes a it becomes mostly it becomes aprivacy issueumbecause all your transaction historywill be there and all of your balancehistory will be thereum but also you can't use it with mobilewallets which is a key component as wellyeah so so the next best option um andunfortunately the most expensive optionis what's known as a plug and play nodeso this is where you'll buyessentially a small box from one of thevarious teamsto name a few we've got uh ronin dojowe've got raspi blitz we've got startnine uh umbrell there's loads ofdifferent companies or my nodeno nothere's loads popping up um all withdifferent feature sets but essentiallythey sell your boxuh that you plug in at home you plug itinto your router you plug it into thepower outletand then within a couple of clicksyou're off and running again to to getyour own copy of the blockchain and haveyour no your own node up and runningand before we move on uh civil dispatchuhcivil dispatch 26i had all the major node teams on for aconversation ontheir node projects so if you'reinterested in having one of thesepurpose-built boxes or you a lot ofthose projects that were just namedallow you to actually buy the hardwareseparatelyand then install their software on it umconsider listening to that sill dispatchright so and the the kind of finaloption is the diy approach like matt'sjust touched on where all of theprojects that we just said and we'llhave a parts list you can go away andbuyspend a couple hundred dollars buying ahard drive and a single board computerand a couple of other cablesand build your own node and put your ownsoftware well put the software thatthese teams provideand onto that hardware uh the the endresult is that you get um the same nodewith all the same features um obviouslythe caveat is that you've got to gothrough the process of buying thehardware yourself flashing the softwareand onto a micro sd card uh which mightcause you some you know if you're a lesstechnical user and you're lesscomfortable with taking that approachand that's why the teams offer theplug-and-play note it does sound moreintimidating than it actually isand i would absolutelyso like i encourage new users to gettheir feet wet um also juston thejust to go back a little bit aboutbitcoin core i mean if you're using youcan use you can also use bitcoin core ifyou're running bitcoin core on the samecomputer you're running spectre on or asparrow they both can connect to itumif you do that process you really shouldbe using it on a dedicated computer iknow i like kind of touched on thatearlier when i said you know if you'reusing it for playing games or socialmediait could get compromised easier becauseyou're using it for all these othergeneral purposes you're downloadingsoftware on it that maybe you haven'tverified you definitely haven't verifiedand have no idea what's really runningthereum so if you are going to go thatapproachyou should have a dedicated device youshould consider a dedicated computer adedicated phone that you are using withit um and uhyeah in general dedicated devices areare going to be more secure and moreprivate you'rewhen we when we talk about security andbitcoin land whereyou don't don't let perfect be the enemyof good don't get overwhelmed becauseyour setup's not perfect but at the sametime you're just trying toreduce your threats so that you're notthe lowest hanging fruit most of thetime when we see these hacks it'stargeted at the people that are mostvulnerableyeah and the just to go back to the diyapproach that was outlining umall of these uh different projects thatwe've spoken about have got reallyreally good documentation and quitevibrant communities as well uh ontwitter telegram or their own dedicatedforum and so don't be afraid to you knowgo and have a browser the documentationlike matt said it's not actually asscary as i made it sound um and also youknow go and ask some questions in the inthe telegram chat or in the slack orwhatever you know um chat room that thethe the project has gotum you'll probably find or you'lldefinitely find thatall of these the people that are inthese communities are really welcomingand they've definitely been in yourposition before now and and you knowthey they found uh the thought of thisreally scary a couple of years ago andyou know now they might be runningseveral diy notes so they'll be don't beoff-put by it100um i will echo that sentiment i wouldjust add a slight caveat that there arescammers in these telegram groups andthese chat rooms um they will often tryand impersonateuhpeople that are involved with theproject or other notable figures to tryand get you feel comfortable never nevergive anybody uh your seed words thosesecret backup boards never give themtheir secret backup boardsand you know always be skeptical ifsomeone in one of those groups tries todm you separately and tries to go into aprivate chat you know sometimes it islegit but you need to be extra cautiousin that type of situationyeah and and if somebody does don't beafraid to ask in in the sort of mainroom you know tag the person who youthink might have dmd you and said isthat his issue at the mme exactly butalways uh just act on the the on air onthe side of caution and and keep thatsort of adversarial mindset to think youknow why is this person reaching out tome completely out of the blue after ijust asked my first question enteringthe room100um so all those node projectssupport something called electrum serverand electrum server is a standardumit's it's a standard way to interactwith your own node um you can use thoseelectrum server details and then you canput them into sparrowyou can put them into many of the mobilewallets that we mentioned earlier youcan put them into blue walletwith samurai specificallythey don't use electrum server they usesomething calleddojoand with that pairing is as simple asthere's a qr code and you just scan theqr code with your samurai wallet on yourphone and it'll pair up with your nodeyeah the good thing is with dojo as wellis it's uh implemented in the vastmajority of the the note packages nowthere's there's more that have dojo thatthen don't which is really great to seeindeedshould we hit on the coin joinokay soi i just want you know we're we're anhour inum if you're a newcomer you just listento this hour and you're intimidated as uh don't be intimidated you knowstart with step one where we talkedabout acquiring your bitcoinumthen you know learn how to hold your ownkeys and slowly move through the processdon't you know freak yourself out thatyou know now now i gotta run a node toolike i'm now i'm really intimidated youknow step by step get your feet wet getcomfortable send transactions receivetransactions back up your wallet restoreyour wallet just get comfortable with itget used to it don't it's not somethingto be scared of it's something that youlearn by doingyeah i uh i put a tweet a couple ofweeks ago actually that kind of echoesthat that you know if uh sending atransaction uh makes you feel a littlebit uneasy then you haven't sent enoughtransactions um you can see on screenthere that the mempool is uh you knowit's a little bit busy than what it wasbut a couple of sats per bite is goingto get your transaction confirmed veryquickly and that's going to cost you youknow less than a dollar to send atransaction so we don't have we don'thave that on the list but before we moveon to coin join on chain privacyutxo management we should probablyhow does how does a newcomer choose whatfee to pay they open up their walletthey go to send a transactionumwhat like how do bitcoin transactionfees work i feel like that is somethingwe tend to gloss overyeah we overlooked that one um wellfortunately most of the the good mobilewallets especially the ones that we'veuh mentioned uh on tonight's stream uhwill give you a couple of options uhwhere you canum you'll they'll either have you knowthree options sort of low prioritymedium priority and high priority likeagain like we can see on screen or theremight be a slider where you can manuallyadjust the feeand essentially the the higher that thefee you pay the more likely that uh yourtransaction is going to be uh confirmedor processed quickeruh againa caveat with that one we've got a lotof caveats tonight is that umthe uh some of the estimation the feeestimations umthese wallets all use different sort ofalgorithms as to how they um calculateor estimate the fee that would berequired to get you confirmed in thedisplayed priorityso matt's got on screen here a reallygreatwebsite called mempool.spaceum which can it shows you again the thepriority uh fee selections uh or what itwould adviseand based on uh correct me from wronggame map but based on what's currentlyin the mempool um as well as sort ofhistorical data as well so it's kind ofaalways a really good sort of accuratelook at you know if you want to get yourtransaction processed within the nextblock uh right now it would take anestimate of 13 sats per byte um butagain there's a little caveat here thatthere's still umtransactions with much lower transactionfees umthan 13 sats per byte that will also getget confirmed so it's kind of umit's not an exact science uh i will saythatbut multiple sources is always a goodone if you want to try and uhget it sort of nailed so i mean bitcoinis a run by a companybitcoin is adistributed networkum and so as a result how bitcointransactions workiswe have this chain of transactionsand the transactions are within blockswe call them blocksumroughly every 10 minutes there'll be anew bitcoin block and it will havefinalized transactions included in thatblockuntil you get into a blockyou sit in a waiting list that waitinglistis we call that the mempool we call itamenpool technically every node hastheir own mempoolumbut if your internet connection is solidin most situations those mempools shouldall look the same so when you go tomempool.space you're looking at theirmempool that will look very similar toif you looked at the same thing on yourown node which a lot of these nodeprojects by the way allow you to runmempool.space natively with your ownnodesothebasically you have this like free marketthat's constantly going on where you'redecide wherepeople are choosing which fee they'rewilling to spend and miners are going tousuallyinclude you in a block based on yourorder in that waiting list based on howmuch you want to spendso if it's a transaction between someoneyou trust um and you're willing to waita longer period of time you can pay alower fee if you're sending just toyourself you can pay the lowest fee wecall that's one sap per byte is thelowest fee because you're just sendingit to yourselfum you know if if in some crazysituation where a one sapper by nevergets confirmed ever which we've neverbeen through you can always resend thattransactionso you're gonna want touh choose your transaction fee based onthe urgency you want that transactionfinalized on the networkand most good wallets will basicallygive you a low medium and highyou knowthislow being i can wait medium being likei'm in the middle ground because it'smedium and high being i don't want towait i want it finalized as soon aspossibleyeah andit'sit's a very much a dynamic thing it'slike a queue that's always evolvingevery single second because there's moreand more transactions being sent youknow every second andumit's not within you know outside therealms of possibility thatwhat the fee that you put up right thissecondmight not be enough to get youimmediately uh processed into the nextblock in sort of five minutes timeum so it's it's very very dynamic andyou know that's why i said it's not sortof an exact science so generallyspeaking for most people the walletestimators are pretty good especially ifit's an urgent transaction that you needto be processedimmediately100 i'm glad we covered that topicum also uhjust uh before we move on to the nexttopic just to jump backwith hardware wallets uhyou know the backup to that hardwarewallet are those words you wrote downumyou have the option of putting them intosteel these steel plates are availablemany different vendors offer the steelplatesand the idea there is if you put it intosteel obviously it's going to be waterresistant and fire resistant it's goingto be more sturdy than paperyou might also consider makingduplicates of those seed words andhaving them in different places so likeif your office burns down or your houseburns down it's still in the otherlocationwith the caveat that it meansit could be more likely that someoneelse finds it because it's in morelocations so you need to think aboutthat very carefullyand then third of all with hardwarewallets which i forgot to mentionone thing i like to tell new coinersis it's a good idea to have to buy twoof whatever you decide to buybecause if you have a second oneyou canyou can have the same backup wordsinitialized on both devicesso then if something happens to yourdevice not only do you have the seedwords available those those secretbackup words available to restore yourdevice you also have the second devicethat still has access to your funds soyou're not in a panic situationum so i always i tend to recommend topeople that they should buy two of thesame device whichever they choose umso that they they can have twoinitialize and you can keep those inseparate locations as wellif you wantokay yeah i think that's good adviceso when you're opening up a bitcoinwallet it shows a balanceum a common misconception isthatthat you know you just it shows yourbitcoin balance that's what's in yourwallet but in reality what's in yourwallet is basically a bunch of differentbitcoin transactions that all add up tothat balanceum we call those utxos uhthose those are unspent transactionoutputs utxos is what we call them youcan think of them like bills in yourwallet like maybe your wallet you knowyour cash wallet has50 in it but in reality it has two 20sand a 10and that's how bitcoin wallets work soyou have all these small utxos in therethat add up to your balance and that hasprivacy implicationsbecause ififtwo of those utxos come togetherum in a single transaction they'reobviously linked on this chainuh forever right we call it theblockchain it's this ledger oftransactions they'll be linked togetherbecause they were both spent in the sametransactionso that brings us to this idea of utxomanagementand coin control the idea oftrying tomanage thosebitcoin transactions in a privacy andcost effective way should you want to gointo that a little bityeah definitely um and quick i willstart with the two wallets that we keepmentioning blue wallet and samurai umoffer all the features that i'm justabout to cover that sort of help when itwhen it comes to to utxo managementandinspectoryeah sorry yeah i keep referring tomobile wallets but yeah the all of thedesktop uh the good desktop wallets thatwe've spoken about i've all got utxomanagement features as well um sothere's a couple of facets to it thefirst one is the ability to uh label thethe utxos or the pieces of bitcoin thatyou've got in your wallet so what wouldbe an example of a label might be thatif matt was to pay me for dinner uh orpay me back for dinner um when ireceived that transaction into my walleti could put a label on that to say thatthat's come from martin it was fordinnerum i could then receive my wages from myemployerumand i could put the the relevant labelon that just to know that where theorigin uhof that utxo is fromumso the once i've labeled themwhen i'm making future transactionsand i'mthere's two ways you can make atransaction you can let the wallet toconstruct it for you automatically whichthey might choose any random utxos andmerge them together again like matt saidto which will show common ownership thatmight not be a problem however if you uhwant to preserve your privacy and imight not want my employer to know thati'm friends with matt because he's a badperson um because i've labeled those i'mnot a bad person thoughbecause i play radical[Music]because i've labeled those utxos when ireceived them at the time um in you knowtwo weeks down the line when i'm goingto make a transaction um i can then chyou know consider and the person thati'm paying you know do i want them toknow that i know matt or do i want themto know that i work for the company thatpaid me uh with this utxo i can makethat informed decision then to say wellactually i'm just going to spend fromone of those pieces of bitcoin oractually it's not a bad thing matt's notreally a bad person i'm gonna combinethe two uh because the value that i wantto send i need to combine the twoum so those are the two two sort of mainfacets to it and and but obviously youcan't ummake a an informed decision when youcome to spend um if you don't know theorigins of all of the etxos that you'vegot and so they kind of go hand in handreally um you need to label so that whenyou come to spend you can make theinformed decision as to whether youshould merge or not yeah so a key aspectof bitcoin isif someone sends you bitcointhey can see where that bitcoin goes inthe futureand if you receive bitcoin you can seewhere that bitcoin came from in the pastsothis is why labeling is importantbecause you want to knowwhere that transaction came fromor it goes tobecausethat's who you're exposing your privacyto in that situationis that a good yeah installation yeahwhich you know um might not be a problemfor you know the person that i'm payingmight not um be able toor be clever enough to to use blockchainanalysis um but the other sort of umadversary that we need to consider hereis chain analysis firms that might betrying to umcluster or monitor your unchain activitywho you're spending to who you'regetting change back from uh to monitoryour habits to try and um piece togetherumyou know the identity because theblockchain doesn't have any identitiesat that at the blockchain layer um butthese companies work to kind oftie all the pieces together so that theycan um de-anonymize people and so it'snot just a case of umyou know hiding how much you earn fromyour friend uh it's also you know thesemore sophisticated actors that have gotmore a lot more resources to throw atthis and that you've also got to bear inmind as well unfortunately yeah you bothyou both don't want you don't want youremployer to knowwhat you're spending things onand you don't want the guy who sells youa sandwich to know how much money youmakebut on top of that we also have theseprofessional surveillance mercenariesthat work for governments dictators andcompaniesand they are just out there constantlytrying to track bitcoin transactions soyou also have that as a concernwhich leads us nicely onto coinjoin ithink if unless there's anything elseyou want to touch on no let's yep we cantalk about coinjoin now so coinjoin umis um acoordinated or collaborative transactionwhereyou and at least one other personwillcollaborate to construct the transactionthat casts some doubtas to theorigin and the output of the transactionto umto make suream thatstill could you still hear mei can still hear you yes oh sorry ithought i dropped out yes it's acoinjoin is a collaborative transactionwhere umthe the idea is that theuh somebody watching the blockchainagain chain surveillance firm youremployer your friend whoever they can'tumdeterministically orwith good probability be able to trackthepeople on the input side of thetransaction to the output side of thetransactionso it effectively attempts to put upsort of um a brick wall in your you knowthe the utxos history so that umanybody looking on chain can't be sure100umyou know is there one person involved inthis transaction is there 10 peopleinvolved in this transaction it justcasts doubt on the the uh path that thebitcoin has taken and and who sort of umyou know has the bitcoin change handshasn't it we we're not really sure so sotracking bitcoin is a probability gameumthese surveillance companies and theirtools will basically or just someonewho's curious and trying to spy on youum will basically assign a probabilityto every transaction if ownership haschanged because one of the things aboutbitcoin isyou know i could send bitcoin to myselfor i could send it to bitcoin q a anduh the chain doesn't delineate betweenthat so a key aspect of tracking bitcointransactions isumdetermining some kind of probabilitythat bitcoin actually changed hands andthen from there trying to seewhich hands it went from from who to whoum so coinjoin is this idea of acollaborative transaction and you canthink of it likeumjust for an example if you have fivepeople that are doing a coin jointtogetherinstead of uh having a simple path thatyou're following on chain and decidingif ownership has changed um all of asudden there's five different potentialpaths it could go downyou don't know which of the five peoplethat participatedwhich of their five outputs are themso it breaks that probability chainand it's a useful tool in terms oftrying torecr to have forward privacy have thisidea of someone who sent you bitcoindoesn't necessarily know which path yourbitcoin took going forwardyeah and specifically with umimplementations of coinjoin likewhirlpool which are known as equaloutput coin joints um the the the sortof notion is that everybody um on theoutput side all of the utx on the outputside of the transactionlook absolutely identical and soit's kind of uh i always like to use theanalogy of v for vendetta where you'vegot the million mask marchit's essentially the same thing but onthe blockchain where all of these utxosare indistinguishable from one anotherand so like matt said you've got someforward privacyand be quickand soi the the three major coin jointprojects our samurai whirlpool joinedmarket in wasabiumcitadel dispatch 15 was with the wasabiteam civil dispatch 16was with the join market teamand civil dispatchi don't know where he is i also did asamurai oneum is citadel dispatchit's there in your feed somewhere youknow uhstefan can just rattle them off he knowsexactly which one is which always amazesme that umi don't know which one it is i'll comeback to it and tell you but it's there'sthere's another dispatch with thesamurai team so if you're interested inthis uh consider going back andlistening to those threeumme and bitcoin q auh like samurai whirlpool the best youcan also you you don't have to usesamurai walla with it you can usesparrow wallet with it as wellumyeah yeah co-sign that samurai orsparrow a hands-down win is for me umespecially from a from a beginner'sperspective um definitely the easiestones to get started with in my opinionyou can continue on i'm trying to figureout which dispatchi'lli'll cover off one quick question that'sum quite on topic and somebody askedwhat's the difference betweenum coinjoin that we've just spoken abouton a coin tumbler so the unfortunatelythe words uh or the the meanings havebeen kind of umwhitewashed somewhat over the years butum generally speaking a coin tumbler isa centralized service where you willhave tosend inyour bitcoin and give up a custody of itto whoever's running the tumbler andthey will send you somebody else'sbitcoin backand i absolutely wouldn't recommendanybody use thesebecause you're putting yourselfum completely in the hands of whoever'srunning the tumbler and that you knowwhether they're going to send you yourbitcoin back or notand yeah soand you also not only you're trustingthem with your bitcoin if you use acustodial mixer it's the same ideas ascustodyum because custodial risks with walletsum you're also you're trusting them withyour privacy and your fundsum so the key aspect of coinjoin is isthe idea that you are reducing trust inany kind of centralized third party umwasabi and samurai have a centralizedserver that they doum[Music]that they use to coordinate the coinjoins to make them easier better uxuh and more reliablethose coordinators are blindedwith samurai specifically you can use itwithout your own node and then you'retrusting samurai's node so that goesback to our earlier conversation aboutusing your own node you should use yourown node when you use samuraiotherwise you are trusting them withyour transaction and balance informationas as is the case with all light walletsum i found it so so it's still dispatch15 is wasabi still dispatch 16 is joinedmarket and still dispatch 30 is samuraiso consider listening to thoseokay i think are we done on coinjsshould we move on to the next topic um ihave multisig as the next topic butshould we do lightning real quick firstsure thing yeah yeah i think it's apt umsoquick high level on what the thelightning network is uh it is a scalingsolution for bitcoin that umallows you toum transact with uhactual real bitcoin um but you don't doso with what's known as an on-chainfootprint and so it allows you to sortof lock up a small amount of well asmuch bitcoin as you want onto thissecond layer solution known as thelightning networkso that you can umyou essentially just defer the theoverall settlement um of any number oftransactions from going on chain to toreduce fees and also to allow you totransact um much quickerso whereas uh one on chain transactionyou know might cost you a couple hundredsats depending on the fees and you youmight be able to send you know 10or even 100lightning network um transactions forthe sameuh for the same amount of fees um nowthere is uhunfortunately lots of caveats with thelightning network again in terms ofbeing able to do it properly uh with uhthe best way to do so be with one of theuh no packages that we've spoken aboutbefore andwhich will dictate that you need tomanage your own sort ofyour own channels which is essentiallywhere you lock up this bitcoin to beable to to transact on this second layerumso it's a little bit more of a hurdle toto get on board with um but you you sortof can save yourself a fair bit on feesespecially if we ever see a feast bikeagain um which i think is inevitable umthe i don't knowinevitable um sofirst of all there's been a lot ofdispatches on lightning if you gothrough the feedconsider listening to those there's likea lot of different caveats and nuanceswhen using lightningspecifically with privacy i did a fullprivacy episode with openobs and anthonythat's still dispatch 21 that's onlightning privacyuh so consider checking that out but themain differentiation that you as a newuser should think about with lightningis going back to our transaction feeconversation earlierwhich iswhen you use a regular bitcointransactionyour transaction fee is not based on theamount you send it could be kind ofweird for youuh it's it's actually based on theamount of utxos that you useuh for the transaction it's based on thedata size not the amount of money thatis sentsoyou could end up sending a five dollartransaction with bitcoin on chain aregular bitcoin transaction and it couldcost the same as sendinga five million dollar transactionnow with lightningit's different the way fees arecalculated on lightning is based on theamount you're sending so that'll be morecomparable to something that you're usedto in traditional finance world where ifyou send more money you're going to paya higher fee you send less money you'regoing to pay a lower feenowuh moon wallet with 2us as we talkedabout earlier mobile wallet supportslightningand blue wallet supports lightning nowif you use blue wallet in its defaultstate with lightning it's going to be acustodial walletwhich i don't loveuh if you insist on using it use it witha small amount because they can takeyour funds you are trusting them withyour privacy um ifuhyou can also use blue wallet withsomething called lnd hub which some ofthese node projects offeri think umbral and my node offered idon't know who else offers it but if youuse it with lnd hub or your friend's lndhub then it's not custodial with bluewallet it's custodial with who's everrunning the lnd hub so if you run thelnd hub yourselfthen it's not custodialotherother lightning specific wallets onmobilethat you can use so moon does bothblue wallet does boththen there's lightning specific mobilewallets that are very good uh there'sphoenixwallet uh there's breeze walletumbreeze b-r-e-e-zcontinuing the bitcoin naming scheme ofusing words and spelling themdifferently um is there anotherlightning wallet that i'm missinglightningeclair as well haven't youwell claire is phoenixphoenixyeah why do they have two okay but yeahboth of those are good yeah one allowsyou to manage your own channels and theother one does it for youokay phoenix does it for youyepokay so forget eclair your new corneryou have phoenix and you have breezewallet or you can use moon or bluewallet and that'srather than for savings you should thinkof that more asokay this is like my spending wallet mytransaction fees are based on the amounti send i'm going to be sending smalleramounts umso i i might use lightning rightyeah i agree i'm quite a big fan ofphoenix um especially from a perspectiveof you know one that a wallet thatmanages the channels for you and i mightget a lot of for this in the chatbut i'm i'm a firm believer that mostnew users don't shouldn't strive todive head first into lightning withtheir own channels because it's it'sit's not easy it's not approachable andeverything that we've already discussedum in terms of holding your own keys umuh using coinjoin and and not using kycare far more important than uh strivingto get your own channels up and runningum quickly uh i don't know what youthink about that matt and i'm waitingfor the in the chat no i mean ithink i i i think umlightning on mobile uh with the walletswe just mentioned moon blueum breeze phoenixfor smaller spending amountsuh is very accessibleuh actuallyif you if you actually want to dolightning in a proper sovereign wayum that i would say is a more advancedthing don't get intimidated by it but ii think it's important for ourall-encompassinggetting started guide that we do mentionit it exists and what are the you knowdifferent trade-offs basically thetrade-off there is a little bit you'regetting less security uh you're gettingless reliability with lightning umbut you're getting lower feesfaster transactions all else equalum[Music]and it could be very useful in a mobilespending type of situationyeah i agreephoenix and brees really great ways toto get started with lightning that havesort of their own unique um trade-offsuh that kind of give the the best ofboth worlds from it from a new userperspectivewhen you compare them with umcustodial solutions like the defaultblue wallet or running your own channelsand that's one of theyeah i mean that's one of the reasonswhy i like moon so much like moon with2us has like different tradeoffsum it doesn't have a standardized backupprocessuh it's you know if if you'rea lot of big corners will say it's youknow not a lightning wallet but at theend of the dayit's not a lightning wallet because youstore all your funds on chain you're notstoring it in a proper lightning walletum but what's cool about moon isif you scan a qr code it could be alightning qr code or it could be aregular bitcoin qr code and it justautomaticallyfigures that out for youum and and vice versa yeah so so you canjust have you can have some spendingcash in your moon wall at muunand whatever whatever bitcoin qr codeyou scan it will send but it doesn'thave power user features it doesn't havethat coin selection that we were talkingabout with utxo management it doesn'thave labelingit doesn't have a standard backupprocessso these are all things to keep in mindright multisig multisig let's let's gohere's where we get into the weeds alittle bit um right so you've been inthe weeds for a whileall of the uh wallets that we've spokenabout umthe desktop wallets mobile wallets alloperate umon what we colloquially call a singlesig setup where they have um a singlesecret or backup um which is requiredwhen you want to spend your bitcoin amulti-sig wallet is where you combinetwo or more of theseseparate wallets together to create abrand new walletwhen you set up this multisig wallet youcan dictatethe minimumamount of keys required to be able tomake ato sign or authorize a send transactionso that could betwo from a possible three keys is apopular one all the way up to somethingelaborate like 11 or 15 you know whichmight be uh used in sort of a businesssetting props um but two of three whereyou need two signers from a possiblethree that were created to that we useto create the wallet to sign off on anytransactions from that wallet so whywould you want to do that wellwith a single sig wallet and some of thethree theoretical attack vectors ifsomeone's to someone but somebody was tosteal your deviceand and umwhile you know if they snatch your phonewhile it's out of your hand and you'vegot your wallet unlocked um they cansteal your bitcoin if that was one ofthe keys in a multi-sig wallet where youneeded two to spend from then they can'tsteal anything from youumanother one of the attacks that multisigprotect from is known as a retirementattack where there might be a malicioushardware wallet vendor thatdoesn't publish their source code um andthey umhave some uhmalware baked into into the the into thedevice and that is actually uh has theability to stealyour bitcoin i will say again correct meif i'm wrong game out but that has neverhappened again it's a theoretical attackbut if you were to use um a multi-sigsetup where you've got differenthardware wallet manufacturers if one ofthose is is maliciousum they can't get access to your fundsbecause they don't have you know if it'sjust one key out of two that arerequired they don't have the uhthe minimum number of keys required tosteal anythingall the goodall the good wallets all the goodhardware wallets are open source sotheoretically open source meansthat the code is available for you toverifyum and you can read the code line byline nowif you're a new coiner you're probablyup to this point you're already reallyintimidated you're like matt i can'tread codei'm aware okaysoat the end of the dayit is very good that you're able totechnically verify the code but mostpeople will be updating their hardwarewallets and they will not be verifyingthe code so there is some trust that youare you're trusting that hardware walletmanufacturer to not ship uh maliciouscode to you and you're also trustingthemuh that that the actual device wasn'tcompromised when it was first sent toyou right so with multisig the idea isyou can have multiple but specificallyin a hardware wallet ida hardware wallet multisig the idea isyou can have multiple vendorsuh that aremultiple different hardware wallets thatcome together to form your walletandyou needa combination of them as bitcoin q a wassaying a common one is two of three youneed two of them to spend the fundsthis reduces trust in any specifichardware wallet manufactureryou also have the added benefituh that those backup words instead ofthose backup words being aumone and done situation if someone findsthose secret backup words we call themseed words if someone finds those wordsthey have access to your funds in amulti-sig setup you haveummultiple sets of backup words and theyhave to find the required threshold ofbackup wordsin order to spend your funds so ifyou're using a two of three you're gonnahave three sets of backup words you'regonna have three hardware walletsthose backup boards obviously can be onsteel as we said earlierum and you can have them in differentlocations so bitcoin gives you bitcoinwith multisig gives you this uniquesituationwhere you can have a geographicallydistributeduh security setup where you're holdingyour own coinbutthethe the keys to access it can be locatedin different places they can beduplicated you can keep copies of themin different places and for someone toactually compromise you and take yourfunds they're gonna need to have accessto a combination secretwe lost bitcoin q a about two minutesago or a minute and a half ago and i'mjust gonna keep talking until hereconnectssothat is the main benefit of multisig[Music]do not once again do not get intimidatedhereuhplenty of people store bitcoin in singlesig uh setups it is thenormal way of setting it upum this is something you might graduatetouh multisig ux multisigumi guess ux can be kind of a complicatedwordlike the way you interface with themultisig walletis a relativelynew thing in bitcoinumso it it has a little bit more of alearning curve it is a little bit morerough around the edgessoyou want to get really comfortable withit as i said earlier you want to bebacking up restoring spending receivinggetting comfortable with it separatelyof your single sig setupnow one cool aspect of multisigis that you canactually have a single sig walletuh so you can be using a hardware walletthat is single sig and then you cantake that single sig and you canactually also use it in a multi-sigenvironmentandit can be one signer of for instance thetwo of three in the multi-sig but alsoit could also be its separate walletum andi guess the main advantage thereumi guess there's two main advantagesthere first of all if someone findsyour single sigback up your your secret words uh itmight have some small amount of funds onit and they think that's all your fundsthey they can't tell that it's in amulti-sig setupumso they might just take that funds andthink they took all your bitcoin umthis thesecondary benefit isthat you know you can repurpose thesethese hardware wallets and use them formultiple wallets now one other caveathere is with multi-sig you do want toback up additional information besidesjust your seed wordsumbitcoin q a came in and then left againso i will continueumthe popular multi-sig softwaresparrowspectre supports it blue wallet supportsitthey will tell you what you need to backup and make sure you save all thatinformation now that informationthat additional information that's notyour seed words umthey will have terms like derivationpathum descriptorthe list of something called x pubs youdon't necessarily have to know what allof that means you just have to save itand you just have to realize thatwhileseed words area security risk if someone gets yourseed wordsthat information that separateinformation that you have to back upwith a multi-stick wallet is a privacyrisk so if someone finds that they cansee how much you're holding in themultisig but they can't necessarilyspend itbut you need that information plus yourbackup boards in order touh to spend your funds bitcoin q are youbacki am apologies for that that'll happen ithink it's my networkno worries at all um i just continued onand i just kept talking about multisigdo you be holding it downumii get i mean i think we arei i think i sufficiently explainedmultisig tradeoffs and and benefitsumshould we move on to mistakes commonmistakesyeah did you cover sort of thealternatives to doing it yourself themultitec approach no i didn't that'sgreat why don't you go into thatyeah so obviously matt's just outlinedsome of the potential pitfalls withdoing it yourself umso one of the other options is known askind of collaborative custodyalternatives where um there will be acentralized service uhsome examples are on chain capital anduh casaumwhere they will help you coordinate amultisit quorum and where they hold oneof the keysand so that in the event that you wereto umso i'll give you an example you'd have akey on your mobile phoneyou'd have a key on a hardware walletand one of theseservices will hold the key as wellso they only have one key so they can'tsteal from you which is greatumbut if you were to lose say your phonewhat their key or the key on yourhardware while and he didn't have itbacked up they will be able to step inas a third party to help you move yourbitcoin so that in a doomsday scenarioand you um you don't lose your lifesavings which is really greatyou will pay for this service and againi'm not sure on how much each charge thebottom tier i think is just over 100umlast time i checked per year and one ofthe the trade-offs with this is that umunless you sign up uh without yourpersonal information which i believe isquite difficult to do umthethese uh centralized um entities thathold the key and part of yourmulti-sitcorum they know who you arethey know how much bitcoin you hold inthat wallet because they hold one of thekeys and they alsohold the sort of uhthe wallet file if you like to put itsimply and so that they canjust as a kyc exchange can umbe able to tie you to your bitcoinidentity so it's worth paying up thetrade-offs yeah and you're using theirnode sothe assumption is if you do this if youuse one of these providersuh you're trusting them with yourprivacy but they will hold your hand andthey will have a spare key for you aswellum and they will help you onboard intothe process they will help you gethardware wallets they will go throughthat whole process but you are trustingthem with your privacy they know yourtransactions they know your balancesandin 99 of situations they know who youare as well uh they'll know the ipaddress of your of your devices that youconnect fromthis is all kind of getting a little bittoo much into the weeds but the key isthat you're trusting them with yourprivacyum i was explaining earlier justbasically doing it yourself so you coulduse your own note and you aren'ttrusting someone in that situation youcan still haveumother people hold keys for you so abitcoin q a started with a two of threesetup because that's a very common setupbut another common setup is a three offive setup and if you do a three of fivesetup you have five total keys and youneed three to spendsoif you need three to spendyou can hold three keys yourself so thatyou know you have and you put them indifferent locations and you know youhave enough to spend it yourself butthen you can also have you know a familymember a frienda lawyerholdhold a key you can have differentcombinations of people hold the key soit can be very useful inum[Music]specifically in in situations whereyou're trying like inheritancesituations where if if you pass away youhave large bitcoin savings uh you knowmaybe a lawyer is holding one in a trustmaybe a couple family members areholding individual ones and theybasically all need to collaboratetogether in order to spend your funds ifyou have three keys with other peopleum but you can also do it in a way whereyou don'tyou don't they never have the thresholdthey need to compromise you pluscombined togetheryeah i think umjust one final thing before we move onto the next topic um inheritance is abig one for me that um i i sort of liketo drive over people who seem to seemkeen to kind of jump into the diyapproaches thatyou know you might have spent some timelistening to some podcasts watching someuh tutorials or reading some guides andfeel comfortable in setting up amultisigumsetup um but what happens if you're notaround tomorrow unexpectedly uh is yourspouse your next kin are they going tobe able to coordinate a spend from a twoor three or a three or five do they knowwhere to find the keys do they know howto recover it and if you answer no toany of those questions then uh all ofyour life savings disappears when youdisappear soand something to bear in mind especiallyif you're going to take the diy approach100 i'd also add that there's a middleground hereuh specifically supported by cold cardcalled seed xor and basically in thatsituation instead of having one seedit's not multisig but instead of havingone seed you have two seeds and you needboth of them in order to spend yourfundsso it's a little bit different thanmulti-sig it can be more accessible topeople uh because you don't have theseadditionalcomplications that we were justdiscussing with multi-sigbut it gives you that benefit of nothaving a single seedbackup wordsthat can be compromised by someonethere's also something that's supportedby pretty much every wallet out therecalled a passphraseand in that situation you have thesebackup boards are usually 12 wordphrases or 24 word phrases thepassphrase is the 13th word or the 25thword and you pick that yourselfso if you do that method then you cankeep the passphrase separate from yourbackup words if someone wants tocompromise you they need access to bothumand i mean if it's a weak passphrasethey might just take your backup boardsand keep trying pass raisesumbut it it adds an additional umburden on them to try and compromise youwithout going through a multi-sig setupum anotherinteresting thing about passphrases isyou can store money on the bear backupwords and then you cannot when you use apasswords it's a separate wallet soin that situation you can actually keepfunds on youryour basic backup boardsand then if someone finds that they'lljust steal those that money and theymight not know you have a passphrasewith the majority of your savings in itum so that's just something to keep inmindawesome do you want to cover off uh somesome common mistakesnext on the listyeah i think common mistakes is a goodspot to go nextuh so i've got quite a lengthy list hereandthe first one of which unfortunately iuhfell fell prey to a little bit um andthat is uh it comes back to our veryfirst pointof cape kycmultiple exchanges and without any realneed to really um so i've just uh sortof expose myself to you know put my nameon loads of different databasesand soit's an unfortunate one that you can'treally undo like we spoke about beforeand if you were to you know listen tothis podcast and decide that youumstill want to gofor a kyc exchange because you think youknow the task of going uh no care adviceandtry and limit your umyour exposure to this by just signing upwith one reputable exchange umi think that's a good one to start anddid youi think that's very good advice like ifyou are going to use a kyc service whereyou're providing your identityinformation you should choose itcarefully you should choose someone youtrust the mostand you shouldnot sign up for a lot of people justsign up for a ton of different servicesyou should only you should sign up forthe bare minimum ideally if you're gonnado it you sign up for oneyou use it solely just to buy bitcoinand then send it to your own walletsumand and you don't you don't use anyother additional kyc services you wantto limit that as much as possiblesecond thing is did you change your micsetup at all because it's way worse nowthan it was beforeuhhello i changed my computer um i'll havea player how much while you're talkingnow turn up is it just quietno we can hear you but it's just likebreaking up a little bit it's likecutting in and outall right i'll let i'll play aroundumanother common mistakeuhthat i see people make isi i mean gambling on coins so a lotof people will think that um bitcoin istoo expensive and i've missed the boatand i i'm too late to bitcoin umliterally every single person who hasentered bitcoin at any time in bitcoinhistory has thought they were too latethere's like a famous screenshot ofsomeone on one of the bitcoin forums uhlamenting that they didn't get in atfive cents and instead they got in at adollar and they were too late and theymissed the busum so everyone feels that wayuh you're not alone in that it'simportant to realize that you cantransact insmaller units of account we call themsatssoyou can you don't have to have a fullbitcoin you don't you don't you don'tneed like right now bitcoins at almost70 thousand dollars you don't need toput 70 000 and to use bitcoin uh satsare the smallest unit of bitcoin there'sa hundred million of themper bitcoin andright now sats you can get 1500 for adollar so you can send any amount ofsats you want to send you can send twodollars worth you can send 25 centsworthumit doesn't matter don't get caught up inin in thinking that bitcoin is tooexpensiveuhwhat common thing that these other coinswill dois they make it so they have so manyunitsthat it seems like it's cheaper than itis just to try and get you in the doorit's a it's a marketing tactic so justkeep that in mind uh q are you thereyeah how's my mic now oh so much betteri'm glad i brought it up perfect okay doyou have more common mistakesuh yeah common one um is just notpracticing umenough with transacting uh testing mybackups for my hardware walletstesting different wallets even usingtest net just practice practice practiceand getting comfortable uh using the thevarious tools that we've spoken aboutandgetting comfortable with it either usingtestnet which is basically uha copy a carbon copy of bitcoin that'shas that holds no value you can get itfor free onwebsites called faucets where you can goon and just mimic the normal behavior ofa walletand without the fear oflosing any real value and so you cansend some test net bitcoin to to your hardware wallet and youcan wipe it recover itand just to get really reallycomfortable with with that process sothatif um the worst was happening and yousomething was to happen to your houseuh where you say bitcoin wherever youstore your coin andyou're when you're in that packed stateit's not like the first time you touchyour hardware wallet for five yearsbecause you you know you've done thatyou know people call practice so you'vegot this lots of time if you send realvalue in there but it'sconnected to you and because you know ifyou're in a panic and you you need tomove your bitcoin quickly the last thingyou might be doing is doing itin unfamiliar uhsituation or in a familiarsituation wherebecause that's when mistakes happen andyou could uh muck something upyeah so we see that happen a lot whereyou know peopleuh so i actually don'tespecially for newcomers i don't know ifyou need to use testnetum it adds just anothercomplication to your processumbut but what happens a lot is likepeople will buy bitcoin they'll send itto a hardware wallet they never reallyuh get comfortable with itthen bitcoin goes up in valuesignificantly and like four years laterthey're trying to spend it and they'rejust not comfortable at allso you really want to get comfortablewith it you want to practice sendingreceiving backing up and restoring umand just you know i don't think testthat's necessary in that situationbecause you should just do it with thesmall amounts you knowuse you know send five dollars back andforthuh erase the wallet restore it from yourbackup see that your five dollars arestill thereum one nice thing about my earlierapproach that i mentioned if having twoof the same hardware walletis without putting funds at risk at allyou can load up one hardware wallet withsome bitcoinand then you can restore iton your second hardware wallet you canload up those secret words onto thathardware wallet and if your funds arethere and you can spend them then youknow you did the backup and restoreprocess correctly without actuallywiping the original wallet so that'sanotherbenefit you're basically verifying yourbackup and restore processyou don't want to be in a situationwhere you have a lot of moneyandyou have a lot of money on the line andyou've never done a backup you've neverhave you've never done a restoredprocess and you're just freaking out andmaybe you wrote down the words wrongi've had that happen to friends wherewe've had to guess the word that theythey wrote down wrong or wrote down inbad handwriting um so you don't youdon't want to be in that situation youwant to practice practice practicei think just to add to that uh backupprocess as well is thatmost of the umor the hardware wallets that we'vetalked about this evening havemultiple different types of backups aswell so i think it's worth noting thatpractice using both of them as well sowe've got the the siege words umboth call card and passport alsoofferingbackups as well where you can store itbackup onto a micro sd card um which is alittle bit easier to store and so iwould urge people to practice restoringfrom both methods as well becauseat the end of the day if again if in adoomsday scenario you don't know whichmethod of backup you're actually goingto have access to or which is survivedwhatever um you know doomsday scenariohas actually happened100um before we move on to more commonmistakes we have alex mccluskey in thechat asking about 401k ira fundsum if you're trying to hold bitcoin in aa in a in a tax beneficial way in yourretirement accounti would just keep this very simple uh ifyou do haveuh a 401k or an ira where you alreadyhave funds

they willhold your handthey will help you through it obviouslyas we said earlier the caveat is you'retrusting them with your privacyum but pretty much in all situationswith retirement funds if you're using atax beneficial retirement uh methodyou're going to have to trust someonebecause it's all getting reported to thegovernment as wellthe nice thing about what unchained doesis you hold your own keys so you getthat tax benefit um but you're holdingyour own keys they can't spend yourfundsa lot of the other programs that are outthereumcan can spend your funds at will and youhave to trust them completely with thesecurity of your funds and your privacyso just something to keep in mindyeah the next one umfrom me is kind of a little bit moreoutside of the box umi lurked around on on bitcoin twitterand in some of the communities uh for alot longer than i really should have umwhen i started to uh interact with withpeople in the you knowwallet chat rooms or the no chat roomsand to use a few examplesmy knowledge grew exponentially fromthen onwards from having thoseinteractions versus me just sitting onthe sidelines and kind of you knowliking a few tweets every now and thenso if i was to go back and kind of havemy time again i i'd absolutely startgetting involved and start contributingand to the conversation much muchearlier because uh personally speakinganywaymy my knowledge just uh you knowskyrocketed compared to where i was justa couple of years ago and so big one forme that oneyeah that's uhand uh i just i think like learn bydoing right practice with small amountsumand get your feet wet rather than feelintimidated and feel like you have toread everything and listen to everythingand watch everything uhbefore you even get your feet wetyeah another one as well is and and mattmight roll his eyes at this one is iskind of going publicumthere there's a lot of value in instaying in the proverbial shadow so tospeak um i would urge people you knownot touh sort of start shouting from therooftops uh that they own bitcoin againbecause you know we talked earlier aboutkyc and how we kind ofcan paint a sort of red cross on yourback a little bit well shout from therooftops um when bitcoin hits anall-time high to all your friendsand might uh inadvertently do the samething one day um you know yeah 100 alittle bit jealous you never know he'sgoing to get jealous andtell somebody else you tell somebodyelse who'san individual that might want to try andget their hands on it soum i would be be candid about who youwho you speak to bitcoin about and it'sa bita double-edged sword that one because uhi think we've all got a little bit of apersonal responsibility to try and helpon on board others as well so um alsosay just kind of be selective about whoyou speak to it and what you sayyeah it is um it might sound a littlehypocritical coming for meum as aas as a as a public bitcoin figureumbutdefinitely in the beginning you shouldnotyou should you should not be talking youshould try and reduce how much you talkabout bitcoin don't make it obvious thatyou own bitcoin don't post on socialmediauh consider using a name like bitcoin qa does i mean it might surprise you buthe wasn't born with that namehe decided on that name himself for theinternet for his bitcoin workumin the future if you do want to becomemore public about ituhyou can do so in a moreresponsible wayum rather than doing it right in thebeginning you can never come back fromit once you do itum so it's something to keep in mindyou should never talk about your ownbitcoin you should never talk about yourown how much bitcoin you haveumthese are best practices uh you don'tyou don't uheven if it's a friend or a family memberit might seem like small amount todaybut in the futureuh it could be a large amount and theywill not forget it they tend to rememberone of the first questions mostfriends and family will ask you is howmuch bitcoin you own they love askingthat questiondo not answer it explain why you don'twant to answer it for themumif people do know you own bitcointhis is where that multi-sig setupreally shines because you can have itgeographically distributed you can haveyour keys in different locations um thatare far away from each other that makeyou getting compromised more difficulteven in a physical attack situation andobviously it is more ideal to live in aplace where you haveum proper gun rights and you can defendyourselfumso these are things to considerum if i was to do it againi probably would not be uh you know aspublic as i am about bitcoin um i made ajudgment calllater on in my bitcoin journey that ifelt we needed more public bitcoinfigures that were talking about realissues and specifically privacy um so imade that judgment call but there aresome mornings that i wake up and regretitumbut there are precautions you can takeand there are benefits though to beingsemi-public about your bitcoin usage uhmeeting people i've met some of the bestpeopleyou know i have i have basically i havefamily now that wouldn't exist otherwiseum but these are all things that youshould considerum as part of your bitcoin journey butin the beginningvery very very stronglywould sayyou know keep keep it as discreet aspossibleum you never knowyou knowyou you don't want to expose yourself toa malicious actor your government couldturn on bitcoina foreign government can use thatinformation against you uh if you'retraveling across a border or somethinglike thatso you you want to keep this in mindyeah the final um sign off one for me umwould beuhi just completely got out of my brainuh what is another two fa is another onea good one to touch on i think um yeswould be um if if you and it's just comeback into me now so i've got two tofinish off um if you again listen tothis podcast decide that no kosc is notfor you and you want to sign up for anexchange and a lot of these exchangeswill prompt you to use uh sms-basedtwo-factor authentication to um i'musing air quotes here to secure youraccountum this is where you'll get a textmessage to when you try and log into theto the exchange they'll send you a textmessage to authorize that login um therehave been multiple umuhinstances where this has beenexploited people have had theirinformation and their accounts hacked onthese exchangeswhich if youunfortunately have got funds on thataccountcan be withdrawn to whoever's got accessto your account they can withdraw it totheir own walletanda better alternative and would be to usean app-based uhtwo-factor authentication so an examplewould be umthere's one called anduh there's one called a edgiest uhthere's another one called um help meout here matt i've drawn a blank umuh did you say agesyeah i said aegis yep aegis is myfavoriteany app-based one and far more secureand there's been far f well aegis isopen source aegis is open source uhthat's a e g i s and the backup processis very easy you got to remember whenyou when you use these authenticatorapps umif your phone dies you want to make sureyou have a backup of themso yeah the most popular one is googleauthenticator and it's notlast i mean i haven't used it inmaybe six years or something like thatbut previously it wasn't easy to back upso make sure you're using one that iseasy to back upand back it up and keep multiple copiesyeah or the other alternative is you canget umlike a physical device that acts as yourthe second factor authentication lookslike a bit of a usb key that providesthe the additional authorizationbut less services tend to umoffer compatibility with those100umi i would say i think for most peoplethe physical device is overkillum can a sophisticated attackercompromise a phone base two factoruh yesum have we seen any widespread cases ofthat no do they still need your emailand your password yes umon that note you shouldn't be using thesame emails and the same passwords indifferent placesum if you go to haveibinpone.com you canput your email address in and it'll tellyou wheneveruh database gets leaked with your emailor your password or your personalinformation um so that's a veryimportant resource but but what we see alot of times is like there'll be like aleaklike maybe facebook will get hacked andthose emails and passwords will then beused at all the other services to tryand get into your accountum so that two-factor code gives you anadditional protection on top of that butyou really shouldbe trying to limit reuse of emailaddresses and never reuse passwords umyeahuh yeah there's one in the chat scoobysnacks asking is a password manager agood idea yes definitely would recommendit to anybody my personal favorite isis bit warden again another free andopen source uh software they do offer apaid version as well but the thefreemium uhoption is perf is perfectly good enoughfor for uh 99 of users i would sayyeah bit warden's great um you justgottaif you're using a password managerum there's some nuance there because ifyou're not self-hosting your passwordmanager you're using awhat's the main onelastpass people love lastpassumit's closed source you're kind ofputting all your eggs in one basketuhso there's some concern there you knowif you if you have all your passwords inthis password manager and that passwordmanager gets compromised then all ofyour accounts are compromisedumwhat i think is like a veryuh easy accessible thing forumnew users or people that are concernedis is your really important passwordsyou can just write them in a notebookyou write them in a notebooksomeone's going to need to get access tothat notebook physically in order tocompromise youumyou might not want to write it outcompletely clear you know maybe somethings you remember versus some thingsare on the paperyou can develop your own like kind ofcode system don't over complicate ityou'll probably forget the passwordum[Music]but uhpaper and pen paper and pen is a triedand true methodyeah absolutely and then just don't putit on athe final one that went out my headbefore um waswe've spoken about uh you know there's alot of information the past couple ofhours umdon't try and uh do everything in thespace of a week especially if you areliterally at step one um i would sort ofpick one of these topics you know wespoke about them in aumin a specific order for a reason and iwould urge people to sort of start fromstep one and try and master each stepbefore they move to the net before theymove on or at least not try to do toomany of them at the same timedepending on the approach depending onthe the approach that you take for thedifferent tools that we've we've spokenuh you know to do it properly and to doit justice and to understand it andpractice it like we've been like we'vebeen sort ofreiterating it's gonna take you you knowum a good bit of time you're gonna haveto dedicate some time to do this and tomaster some of these tools so trying todo too much too soon is setting yourselfup to to fail so take your time uh beum deliberate about it and and sort ofmaster something then move onyeah and our i that's great advice andas bitcoin q a said our order in thisepisode was intentionalso don't feel like you have to gothrough all the steps at once butgo throughthat order was how we we we chose thatorder specifically because we think it'sa very um[Music]efficient effectiveuh managing trade-offs and stuff balanceof what order you should kind of becoming into this um we also have someperson in the chatum who uses the nim some person so everytime i call him out in the chat i soundlike i'm just don't care about his nameuh asking for the best a two-factor appfor ios i really like authenticator plusfor ios users um i think it's availableon android as well but if you're onandroid i really just like aegisumso yeah there you go for that answerum i have on this list bitcoin q a ihave common questions do you have commonquestions that you have in mind orum i've got nothing noted down but kindof umoff the top of my headum a common one that i get is sort of uhis umis this setup good for me or is thiswallet the one i should useuhyou know insert service or or tool hereyou know is this goodum it's the thing with bitcoin and andusing the tools properly that we've beenspeaking about is thatwhat matter i might recommend from ourown personal experiencesmight not be perfectly applicable toyour own personal uh throat metal threatmodels or skill set um soagain we we have kind of covered thisground a little bit earlier but is umjust try things out um you know by i'mnot saying don't come to the people imatter myself and ask for advice youknow we're always um more than happy toto to help out um but the best thing todo is to sort ofget your hands dirty and try these toolsyou know you can do it for for free orfor a very low fees at the moment andjust testing out wallets or or differentdevicesor multi-sig setups if you want to gothat far coinjoin implementationsumbest thing to do is get your hands dirtyget get amongst the communities and youknow what's perfect for one person mightnot be perfect for another so umit's a bit of adyor do your own research and getcomfortable with what's going to workfor you really100 um just to reiterate umbitcoin q a has all of his guides atbitcoiner.guideumi have a list of resources and tools atcivildispatch.comhelpat the top of civildispatch.com help ihave also i have links toboth bitcoin q aummyselfand our buddy katan from australia whoruns ministry of nodes offers uhwe offer private one-on-ones and there'slinks to all of that at the top ofcivildispatch.comhelpum so if you dofeel that you you have the need for aone-on-one a specific time to jump on acallum that is available to you as well ihighly recommend both bitcoin q aand and katan uh for that and that's whythey are at the top of that pageumi thinkuh narwhal tacos has an interestingpoint i i kind of touched on it but ifelt like it was a little bit too earlyin the episode so i didn't go heavy intoitumhe's asking have you explained that noone actually holds their sats in a wallat just the key it took me a while towrap my head around thatthat is absolutely correctum you're not actually storing yourbitcoin you're storing the key thatallows you to access and spend yourbitcoin um so when we talk about allthese wallets when we talk abouthardware wallets and mobile wallets it'sreally uh either piece of software apiece of hardware that is that isstoring that secret key for you andallowing you to easily access that soyou can access your bitcoin um i thinkthat's an important point but i i do iwould say thatthat's almost more of ai don't know i i feel like it's more ofan advanced thingfor all intents and purposes you cankind of operate under the assumptionthat you're holding your bitcoin in thewallet butum it is a good it is a good point thankyou narwhal tacos um i think with allthat said it doesn't seem like we haveuh any any additional questions in thelive chat i would add that obviouslythis is still dispatch 43 there's been42 other episodes filled with contentum well that's a lot more advanced thanthis so if you want to dive into thatafter listening to this obviously feelfree to do that it's all available forfree without ads or sponsorsum q a you have any any additionalthoughts here before we wrap upi just want to reiterate just getamongst the communities use the toolsget your hands dirty don't be afraid totry things out um come to myself or mattfor any help and advice and just oneother you know we've mentioned katan umone of the prominent educator in thespaces uh btc sessions got a fantasticyoutube page that's got guy video guideson using literally everything to do withbitcoin so um if you're more of a visuallearner uh check out his youtube channelit's a fantastic resource as well 100that is also linked at civildispatch.comhelp or you can just search btc sessionson youtubeum i made him a channel on bitcointv.comi don't think he has uploaded anythingtherebut there's also a ton of great contentat bitcointv.com that is curated one ofthe issues and the pitfalls you shouldkeep in mind when you're on youtubeumespecially the high view count videosare filled withscams and bad advice um so you need tobe very careful uh you know if you'rewatching a btc sessions video it mightrecommend another video that looks likeit's reputable and that a lot of peoplehave watched and recommended ityou need to be very carefuluhat the end of the day bitcoin's aboutpersonal responsibilityumso no one's gonna be there if you loseyour bitcoin there's no getting it backuh and there'sthere's a lot of money to be made givingbad advice and showing bad productso you really really need to beskeptical all the timethink for yourself make your owndecisions and constantly keep learningand i want to be very clear herethat i'm not asking you to trust meeitheror bitcoin q a or catan or anything elsewe've mentioned in this video in thisvideo or any of the other civil dispatchepisodesyou need to constantlyfigure out things for yourself and makeyour own judgment calls if anyone'sasking you to trust thembe very very careful and just be verycareful in generalumbtc pins wants everyone all thenewcomers to know that they could buythey could buy merch from him atbtcpins.com so there you go btc pins

bitcoin onapple pay here's what he saidit's something that we're looking atit's not something we have uhimmediate plans to douhfori would sort of characterize it as thereare things that i wouldn't dolike umuh our our cash balancei wouldn't go invest that in crypto uhnot because i wouldn't invest my ownmoney in crypto but because i don'tthink people buy an apple stockto get exposure to cryptoand so if they want to do that they canthey can uhuhyou know invest directly in crypto orthrough other meansuh and so i wouldn't do thatand i'm i'm not planning to in theimmediate future to take crypto for ourproductsas a as a mean of tender uh but thereare other things that we're definitelylooking at like whatuh like i wouldn't want tohave anything to announce todaywell let me ask you a different questionbecause you just said that you might notdo it personallydo you own crypto in any bitcoin orethereum would you play around with thisi i do yeah i think it's reasonable toown it as a as a part of a diversifiedportfolio and i'm not giving anybodyinvestment advice by the wayso[Music]happy bitcoin tuesday freaks it's yourboy matt o'dell here for anothercitadel dispatch the interactive liveshow

it's all encompassing from startto finish new new bitcoin are cominginto the space trying to do things youknow the right way trying to do thingsin a secure wayumand and just have it all in a singleepisode have it all in a singleconversationso as i was saying earlier the writerdies that are in the live chat um if youhave questions put your questions in ifif you're not a beginner and you'relistening in and you think we missedsomethinguh feel free to put that in the livechat as well and just a reminder thelive chat is accessible through thetwitter twitch and youtube streams andthey all getfed into uh the main chat so with allthat said i'd like to introduce bitcoinq a how's it going bitcoin q ahey matt it's going good thank you forhaving me back on uh it's been a while ithink um episode number two was now withthat with ergo so uh yeah lookingforward to getting back to it and uhrunning through some some of thebeginner-focused uh stuff that seems tobe missing from some of the podcasts uhfloating around me to tend to get jumpinto the weeds pretty quickly sometimesdon't we yeah i mean i have a feeling weare going to also be jumping into theweeds but we're going to try and do itin a nice constructive path into theweedsyeah i need you to keep me uh keep me incheck on that onebut yeah you are a dispatch lg it hasbeen it's been a minute and uh we'vewe've both been through a loti like to see like to think that we'vebeen through it together and uh yeahjust uhlove that you're back joining us and youknow i hope it's you know not just thesecond time it'll be many more times inthe futureumso with all that said freaks uh we havea bit of a structure that we set up forthis episode which is unusual fordispatch but i think it'll keep usmore focused um and so we're going tostart withactuallygetting bitcoin for the first timeum so do you want to you want to startwith that bitcoin q ayeah so uh it's buying bitcoinsnever been easier than it is todaythere's uh exchanges popping up all overthe place every every man in this dogseems to beuh giving you the opportunity to to beable to buy bitcoin from within theirecosystem or their appumthe the kind of elephant in the roomunfortunately and uh is is the um knowyour customer or kyc is it's uh it'slovingly called within the spaceumkyc is a regulation that essentially anysort of businessentity that has a banking relationshiphas to abide by that kind of dictates umthat they must collect certain pieces ofinformation from anybody that they givea service to obviouslyin the context of bitcoin that's anexchange that sells you bitcoin fordollars pounds yen whatever yourjurisdiction isumso in practice that looks like if youlike go on the cash app and you try andsign up to cash app to buy bitcointhey require you to upload your id youraddressuh i'm not sure some some servicesrequire like a selfie um that's whatwe're talking about right here which isthis identification information that'srequired when you sign up to one ofthese regulated servicesright and some of these are some ofthese exchanges now are even doing uhvideos where you they take that like a3d scan of your face which is kind ofscary really andso with all that said why why is thatkind of um why is that sort of a badthing that that people like matt andmyself sort of try andumwarm people away from or at least paintthe dangers clearly for everybodyeverybody um so when you supply thisinformation to to be able to buy bitcoinin a you know a really sort of easy andstress free way you know cash apps agood example where you can just in acouple of clicks get some bitcoin into awallet that you controlbut one of the main problems is that youknow all of this information getsrounded up into a centralized databasethat's controlled bythe entity that you're doing businesswithum unfortunately these entities or someof these entities they won't toureverybody with the same brush um don'thave a great track record of uh securingit effectively umtalk about perfect timing we we heardabout um a hack with uh robin hoodyesterday was it it was seven millionusersseven million users uminformation has been leaked um nowthere's varying degrees of the severityof the leak some of it's just emailaddresses uh some of it's more personalinformation like banking details etcumyou know to name a few others equifaxfacebook t-mobile clubhouse linkedinuh coinbase ledger um all of thosecompanies umrequiresome form ofof your personal information to to dobusiness with them and and they've allhad hacks where again with varyingdegrees of severity that um somebodythat shouldn't have got their hands onyour information did so i'm you knowwhat we're not talking small fry heresome of these uh hacks were in to thetune of millions and millions of ofpeopleum now you know if that's something likefacebook and your uh email address getsleaked you know it's not really the endof the world it might piss you off alittle bitwhen you tie that into umsomething like bitcoin wherehopefully especially after you'velistened to this podcast and you're sortof securing your own wealth that mightbe uh in your house that might be in aloved one's house or a combination ofthoseif uh if if the wrong person was to gethold of this information you know yourselfie your home addressum indicate in the case of coinbase howmuch bitcoin you've actually boughtthat is umessentially painting a very large crosson your front door that ummight make it inviting to the wrong typeof people to come and pay you a visit tosee if they can relieve you of of thosesatsso that's one of the main umyou knowuh reasons that that i personally tryand sort of make people aware that yesgoing on to cash app or coinbase orwhatever is is you know they make itreally really simple they've got reallynice polished uis to to be able to goand umget some get your hands on some statswithin it within a couple of clicks umit'syou know one of the big big risks isthat this information is leaked on aregular basis and there are companies inspace that to their credit and haveyou know they've nev never umbeen fallen prey to one of these attacksand but unfortunately they do seem to becoming um more and more uh frequent umso yeahthat's one of the main risks with kyc soyeah i mean i would add a couple thingshere uh first of all even if you know acompany hasn't been compromised yet weshould basically operate under theassumption that they will be compromisedin the futureumthis information once it is taken isoften soldto other people as wellit can be combined with otherinformation that was leaked from otherdatabases so for instanceumif you know you you have the facebookleak and the facebook leak has yourmailing address in it and then you havethe ledger leak and your ledger leak hasyour email address in it but thefacebook link also had your emailaddress in it they can combine those twouh leaks to get your full email addressand your actual in-person addresssecond of all we've seen umwe've seen physical attacks happen topeople who were known bitcoiners and howmuch bitcoin they had uh sometimes itwas because of these leaks it's hard totell for sure sometimes it's becausepeople just talk about their bitcoin andhow much bitcoin they own which you alsoshouldn't doumthird of alluhthis information can obviously be usedagainst you by your own government itcan also be used against you by foreigngovernments in the future obviously itis painting a target as you are someonewho owns bitcoin and uses bitcoin andexactly how much bitcoin you haveuh and then fourth of all in thecoinbase league specificallyumall of your withdrawal history was alsoleaked so uh it can be used to trackyour future bitcoin transactions uhbased on that information and we will gofurther in onon bitcoin privacy and trade-offs ofbitcoin when using bitcoin trying to useit privately how to go about that inlater on in this episode but these arejust things to keep in mindright so you know all of which is issort of incredibly scary um and theother thing final thing odds aboutbefore we sort of look onto thealternatives is that you know umsomething that i like to sort of keep inmind and remind people is you knowbeing here for number go up is great youknow i'm not going to sit here and saythat um i don't like to see us hitall-time highs all the time um butbitcoin is also umcreated to be able to make thetransactions that they don't want you tomakenowif you're sort of uh tying all of yourbitcoin to your personal identity umyou're you're kind of putting a inyour armor before you've even startedthat you know if you do want to makethose purchases that umbitcoin allows you to make um due to itspseudonymity thenyou're sort of starting two steps backby tying your your bitcoin holdings toyour personal identity um which is wheresort of buying from a new kyc source itcomes in so that you can have umsome or hopefully you know in a perfectsituation all of the bitcoin that youownso before we get there before we getthere just one more thingkycthese records are forever once once youdo these records you have to assumethey're foreverum is it best practice to delete anaccountum i you know if you're no longer usingit yes but you should assume that actualdatabase record hasn't been deleted umand it might be used against you in thefuture um so these are things to keep inmind umnow let's move to okay so if you'retrying to avoid kyc you don't want touse one of these regulated services whatare your optionsright so the the sort of uh two mostcommon ones that kind of get bannedaround in terms of actually purchasingbitcoin um is bisque uh which is apeer-to-peer uh decentralized exchangewhere you essentially it's a maker takermodel where somebody will want to umsell some bitcoin and they will go on tobisque and they'll say you know i wantto sell uh x amount of bitcoin for thismuch um you know 500 whatever and andthen you as a buyer can go on to thatsort of uh peer-to-peer marketplace andand look for these offers to see onethat sort of fits your bill that youknow was is within your price range andyou know the amount that you want to buyyou can go on completely and honestanonymously and and sort of take theirtheir sell offer so that you can buythat amount of bitcoin from themumthis isbisqyep so it's an application that you justdownload onto your computer basicallyyou run it all locally uh you knowthere's no personal information youdon't need to show any id's to sign upthe only person again depending on thepayment method that you use you knowthere's many many payment methods umsome are better from a privacyperspective than others and but let'ssay you knowmost people are going to go on and andif they want to sort of be able to takea wider range of offers from you knowmore people across the world they'regoing to want to use the banking systemwhich you know might ring some alarmbells to some other people listening butumwhat also i say is what's worse issharing your banking information withone person who is very likely to wantvery likely to be a privacy preservingindividual because they you know theyprobably wouldn't be using bisqueotherwise versus uh the regulatedentities that throw all of yourinformation into a centralized honey potthat we've just explainedum so that's one way you know some ofthe more private options that areavailable on bisc umare sort of postal money orders whichyou know i don't really know great dealabout um because it's a u.s centricthing um but you've also got cash in themailand then there's various various otheroptions that are kind of uh relevant totheir sort of jurisdictionsumanother option as well is huddle huddlewhich worksquite similarly to the way i've justdescribed with bisc and the thedifference being is a huddle huddle iskind of a centralized company um thathosts uh the sort of buy and sell uhlocations for you you know it's awebsite huddlehuddle.comum where you can go and sort of makeoffers or you can take offers again inthe same fashion umso so there may be some uh other alarmbells are in game where thinking whereum well what happens if i go on tobiscor to huddle hollow um and i youknow take this buy offer and i sendsomebody some some you know us dollarsand what's to stop them from just neversending me the bitcoin so both of theseservices um work on what's called anescrow system where the seller will haveto deposit the bitcoin first into amulti-sig wallet that is controlled byum by the buyer the seller and the sortof centralized entity um so thatbasically they theyuh can't sort of run off uh once they'veyou know got hold of your dollarsbecause they have to deposit the bitcoinfirst and and you'll be notified to waituntil you send any of the payments sothat they've proved that they've sort ofdepositedthe bitcoin into that um there is stillsome risk there but it's a reduced riskyeah absolutely you knowit's kind of i would say it's more of agrief and attack than ayou're not really at risk of losingfunds it's more of a um going throughthe arbitration process to prove thatyou've sent the dollars so that you getthe bitcoin back in the end so it'sgonna be more of a headache more than arisk to to actually lose any uhany cash would you sayyeah more or less umsoyeahcontinue so some of the other options umif youuh you can buy from bitcoin atmsthere's a really great website calledcoinatm radar.comwhere you can go on and punch punchingyour physical location i would recommenddoing sousing a vpnand and it will tell you all of thebitcoin etms thatare in your local area the the generalpremise of these is that you uh walk upyou can deposit some cashuh give it a um bitcoin address uhhopefully from a wallet that you controlwhich we're going to come on to laterand the bitcoin will be depositeddirectly into that wallet that youcontroluh there are again as is always the casewith bitcoins from caveats um justbecause you're depositing cash doesn'timmediately make bitcoin atm superprivate depending on the umthe brand of atm machine that you usesome of them do still ask for id um butthat is uh distinguished on the websitei've just said which is callingatmradar.comright some ask for id and thenand then some ask for just a phonenumber some ask for bothyeah which and obviously the the onesthat just ask for the phone number arethe better ones because you can spoofthat with services like textverified.comwhere you can just get kind of a burnernumber uh to satisfy the atm's umuh you know phone number requirementsbut obviously that's not tied to to yourpersonal identityum and then before we continue before wecontinue since we're still like early inthe episode and i should have mentionedin the beginning uh bitcoin q a has uhmy favorite guides in the space so ifyou want to look up somethingspecifically or if you prefer readingum if you go to bitcoiner.guidehe has all of his guides listed there sojust keep that in mind okay continueyeah pretty much everything that we'retalking about i've got some uhsome form of information on it um soyeah moving on to other noko i seeopportunities um so we've covered uhpeer-to-peer peer-to-peer exchangeswe've covered atms and the the next sortof option is to uh is to earn it umwhich might sound a bit outlandish tosome people are new and entering thespace but also we'll say is thatumeverybody has some form of a uniqueskill um and there's always going to besomebody who needs umwhat you can offer them uh it's justabout sort of uh trying to build up abit of a reputation whether that's inyour local area or online and so thatyou canyou knowsell your time or your skills andknowledge um and receive satsin in in repayment for themand the other option again probably notas much of a beginner optionas i would like it to be but the otheroption is to mine itumalthough home mining does seem to begoing through somewhat of a renaissancewhich is really really great to see andso the the general premise of that isthat you canbuy a bitcoin miner you can plug thatinto your um outlet at home plug in anethernet port connect up to to a miningpool and stream yourself somesecret sats or some private no kyc satsuh directly again into your wallet thatyou control umthere's been you know a fair bit of foodbanded around that home mining is iskind oftoo difficult or it's too expensive umthe the thing i would say is that yeahit's very much dependent on yourelectricity prices um but again you knowthis this shows fairly us centric andthere's a lot of places in the u.s whereyou know and if you'reum earning anywhere less than i thinkyou knownails in the chat they'll probablycorrect me on this but i think you'reprofitable mine at the moment anywherebelow 30 sats 30 shots yeah so i meanwith with all of these techniques youmight be spending a little bit moremoney than you would beum if you went through one of theseregulated services um you'rethe way i justify it is i mean you'reyou're paying a little bit of a premiumfor privacyand you're paying that for privacy goingforward too so it keeps paying dividendsuh with mining specifically mining homemining is a fantastic wayuh in my opinion ofaccumulating kyc free setsumit's really nice because once you haveit plugged in it's just constantly goingyou don't even have to really thinkabout it just constantly bringing inmore sets um we already have two wholemining umcivil dispatches so if you go back ifyou go to civildispatch.comor if you go through the podcast feed orif you go to bitcointv.com and ourplaylist over there you can find thoseepisodes and we're about to have a thirdone too uhi think november 30th there's gonna be athird home mining episode so if that'ssomething that interests you you shouldgo check those out uh starting with thefirst one uh because we literally spentlike three hours on all the differenttrade-offs thereyeah just to come back on on somethingthat you said about um generallyspeaking you're absolutely right thatyou're gonna pay uma little bit more for uh noko ac satsyou know especially if you go to thepeer-to-peer exchangesum but i just i like to try and reframeit and you know it's not a a no kycpremium and the theprice that you see on a kyc exchange ilike to call it the um the discount thatyou get given um for giving up yourpersonal information and puttingyourself uh a little bit more at riskthan versus uh getting some sats thatare not tied to your identity so i thinkthat's like that useful framing yeah thereal price is the private way and thenexactly discount if you sacrifice yourprivacyum and then one method that you didn'tmention which isprobably the most uh accessible to newcoinersis if you have a friend or a couplefriends that are interested in bitcoinand they've been in bitcoin for a whileum obviously if you can if you can paythem cash for some of their bitcoinum that is the most private uhi wouldn't say the most private but it'sdefinitely the most accessible privateway for a new coinerand if they if they don't want to sellyou any they might know someone whowants to sell some soum that's always something to keep inmind cashin person isextremely gives you very good privacyguarantees periodumwhat else also like if you knowto the to the bitcoiners out therelistening to this uh showum you know guide your new cornerfriends in throughthat kind of method right and whether ornot you want to actually explicitly sellit to them that's one thing butyou know if you if you go out to dinnerhave them pay for dinner with their withtheir cash or their credit card and thenpay them back in bitcoin orgive them you know birthday gifts inbitcoin and like get them started in apeer-to-peer fashion rather than justthrowing them to the wolves and sendingthem to a regulated exchangeyeah there's a couple of people in thechat that have just uh rightfullyshouted out um as techo vouchers as welland which is essentially uh you'll getsort of stores uh that sort of sign upto become an azteco um sort of vendorand you can go in hand over some cashand you'll get sort of a voucher whereyou can go and claim the the equivalentamount of sats from that again directlyinto a wallet that you controlthe the the other caveat the sorry theonly caveat with azteco is that thethe sort of uh kyc responsibility if anyis put onto the specific vendor so itwon't just be you know don't justpresume that because there's an articleum vendor near you that it won't be nokyc uh each one is sort ofuh left to kind ofcome up with the their owninterpretation of whether they need todo it or not basicallyand you have that major chain in you inthe uk that's an azteca vendor rightwhat's the name of thatit was poundland but then it stopped acouple of months ago and it's showing nosigns of coming back unfortunately uhokay so as they realized what was goingon they're like ah we can't too muchliabilitywhich was a shame because they they havea store in literally every town therewas hundreds of them and it was massivefor the uk but yeah unfortunate to knowmore okay well that's a shame um if youwant toread more aboutthe dangers of kyc you can go to bitcoinq a's website no kyc only dot comumhowever you decide to proceed withobtaining bitcoin and accumulatingbitcoinum the next step istrying to secure it uhsecure it well and secure it in a waythat you don't have to trust a thirdparty uh who can seize your fundsum so how shouldhow should bitcoiners how should newcoiners go about that bitcoin q awhat are their optionsthe natural uh first step for mostpeople unfortunately like we've justsaid is is um a centralized exchangeagain like coinbase cash app or someonesomething like thatwhere you will go on deposit dollars oryour local currency they will uh sort ofcredit your account with you know theequivalent amount of statswhat you have there is um an iouwhere you've got an account with themwhere they say that you've got this muchbitcoin essentially what you actuallyhave in real terms is uh well it's aniou and you don't actually hold anybitcointhe the sort of uh very essence ofbitcoin is the uh that you know thatgoes to say you're not your keys notyour coins which is banded around a hellof a lot and for good reason and itessentially means that if you're notholding the keys for your bitcoin uh youdon't actually have any bitcoinso you bought someone in exchange um thethe next step would be to get yourselfum a mobile walletwhere you can uh generate the keys uhwithin that wallet um so that your youand only you are in control of uh any ofthe bitcoin that you send to that walletum so before we before we move on andi'm sorry that i keep cutting you off ii hope i hope it's uh fine with youbefore you move on umso so the risk is if you're holding itif you're holding it in one of thesecustodial wallets which is what theexchanges default toum and there's some other services thatalso are custodial walletsumbasically the telltale sign of that isthe way you access it is through ausername and passwordumyou don't have any backup yourself whathappens there is there's a highlikelihood that your account could getfrozen we've seen that with paypal inthe past with fiat with just us dollarswhere paypal will freeze your accountand you're not able to get your moneyum it could be stolen if the exchangegets compromised or the custodial walletgets compromisedum and obviously you're trusting yourprivacy completely with the custodianbecause they know all of yourtransactions and your current balancesso it's not idealum and you want to learn how to holdbitcoin yourself becauseone of the revolutionary things aboutbitcoin is that you can hold it yourselfin a way thatumsomeone has to physically compromise youuh to to take your bitcoinum soi guess you're about to start withmobile wallets i think mobile walletsare the most accessible way getting awallet on your phone basicallyum to hold your bitcoin for you rightyeah just before i get down to themobile wallet it comes back to the pointi made earlier about censorshipresistant or being able to make thepayments thatum you know you want to make not thatthey give you permission to to make umif you've got to uh ask for permissionfrom an exchange to be able to sendbitcoin to your desired destination umyou know you're asking for permissionand you know that's not why we're herewe want to be able to spend our money towhoever we want whenever we want sofirst step and the easiest step is toget a phone wallet you know they're freethey're easy to access you know you candownload from any popular app store orquite a lot of them offer umdirect downloads so that you canuh download from the the you know thechosen teams umwebsite or or github umthe a lot of people tend to rush in andtry and buy um you know the next besthardware wallet straight away whenthey've just bought sort of 100 ofbitcoin to dip their toes in a littlebitwell if you you know if you're justdipping your toes in to see if thisthing's uh working for you then itdoesn't make any sense to you know goout and buy a hardware wallet and thisis coming for somebody who works for ahardware wallet company um it doesn'tmake any sense to go out rush out andbuy acouple hundred dollars on a hardwarewallet when you own less than that inbitcoin so that's why you already have aperfectly good phone that you carryaround with you it's very easy to spendand receive fromum but the important thing here is thatyou use a reputable mobile walletthere's a lot of scammy mobile walletsdon't just open up the app store andsearch for bitcoin wallet you will get alot of bad options thereyeah the the unfortunately the the top10 um results for that sort of search inmost of the app stores are quite abysmalmy personal recommendations would besamurai wallet if you're an android useruh or blue wallet or if you're an iosuser uh moon wallet is also another onethat i know you're pretty bullish onthat as well yeah both blue wallet andmoon wallet that's with 2us m-u-u-n areavailable on both android and iosumthey'rethey're very easy to use for beginnersuh i i would say they're not veryintimidating umso don't be intimidated you shoulddownload one just try itso the the kind of general premise ofthese and unfortunately i mentioned moonwallet there it's gonna umit's gonna book the trend of what i'mabout to say but the general premise isyou'll download the app from your chosenlocation uh the the app when you set upa new wallet the app will show you alist of 12 or 24 words which is yourmaster secret um you know which is thethe master backup to your to yourbitcoin wallet anybody that gets theirhands on that and be that physically ordigitally um is going to be able to takeall of your fundsso make sure that you write that downand secure it somewhere um safe andthenso moon wallet has a different backupmethod um it'll prompt you and explainhow to back up that butwe will focus on this standard which issomething we call seed words which isthey're basically these wordsit's a phraseand the wallet generates it for you andyou need to keep them secret youabsolutely need to keep them secret soyou don't want to put them on aninternet connected device you put themon you don't want to like save them inyour icloud notes folder you don't wantto take a screenshot and upload it toicloud what you want to do is at thebare minimum you want to write it downon a piece of paper double check thatyou wrote it down correctly store itsomewhere securely because if someonegets access to it they have access toyour funds but as long as you have thosewordsyour phone you could drop your phone inthe toilet it could fall you know itcould fall and crack and break or justcompletely justyou know some phones just like stopworking sometimesas long as you have those seed words youcan reinstall the app on a new deviceand just put in those words put in thatphrase words and you will have access toyour fundsyeah and the beauty of that is like yousaid most of the you know 99 of thewallets umin the space all sort of work to thatsame standard so you know you wouldn'tnecessarily have to even uhdownload the exact same mobile wallet aslong as the mobile wallet that youchoose umit abides by the rules which again mostof them do then you can sort of put thatseed phrase into into any other walletand there's a quick question in the chatwhich i think is probably good to touchon before we move on to hardware walletsandsomebody asked how much would you needto own to get a hardware walletnow obviously i'm not going to be ableto answer that for the for everybodythat that's watching you know it's quitean individual questionand all i would say is you knowif it's yourthe only mobile wallet you've gottenit's on your daily phone i would use theequivalent of how much cash would youphysical cash would you carry aroundwith you um you know what's your limitat which it's gonna start um affectingyour life if you used to lose thatbalance umthe quick review the mobile wallet themobile wallet should be like almostconsideredis is like your spending wallet what youwould have right inin in your back pocket but uhgoing further when we go into moremethods of storing your bitcoin thatwould be more like a savings accountum except i you're about to say a caveatuh i mean i have my own caveat i wouldsayi thinkespecially if you're using a reputableonei think people can feel a little bitmore comfortable than the kind of amountof cash they would carry in their pocketum i know like i wouldn't feel morecomfortable i wouldn't feel thatcomfortable carrying more than like 400in my pocketum but like a mobile wallet especiallyif it's your first wallet you're justgetting started you're gettingcomfortable you have your seed wordsbacked upuh your phone's up to dateyou know we don't seehacks are theoretically possibleobviously phones get compromised all thetimeumbut i i would probably if i had to picka number i'd like being like the 5 000to 10 000 rangelike that's where you start having toreallyconsider securing it moreum and you should also operate under theassumption because bitcoin tends togo up fastumyou should be prepared ahead of timebecause it could beyou know it could be a thousand dollarsin there and then in six months it couldbe worth eight thousand dollarsyeah the the other thing i would say aswell is that thisalmost everybody has got a spare phonelying around at the house that you knowyou could use that as your sort ofdedicated bitcoin phone and where youcouldbe slightly more comfortable storing youknow maybe larger amountsrelative to the individual and and thenyou could kind of decant off into yoursort of daily phone what you might wantto spend on a day-to-day basisabsolutely nothing wrong with thatapproach as well if you didn't want toand shell out quickly for for umfor a hardware wallet which we can wecan come on to now and so hardwarewallet is well before we get to hardwarewallets you also havethere's also software wallets on on thecomputer that you can haveright so you have mobile wallets youhave software wallets on your computerwhere it's like you install an app onyour computerumi i mean i would saylike unless you're an advanced user andyou have like a dedicated computer andthis episode isn't for advanced usersthey should probably shy away from thatin the beginning i i think the mobilesecurity model is a stronger securitymodel as you know as long as you're notworried about like the nsa or somethingum or like the chinese intelligenceservicesor these intelligence services um mostmost of the population uh are not greatat securing their their computer uh mostpeople's computers are unless you'resort ofa bit of a hacker man there's this youknow a far more vulnerable device thanyour mobile phone iswhich is why like you said you know icompletely agree that i don't recommendthem especially for larger amounts umand i tend to sort of skip straight tothe hardware wallet after the mobilewallet stageumsohardware wallets um are essentially adedicated uh physical deviceum designed to manage the the keys thatcontrol your bitcoin um so with thembeing a a physical dedicated device youknow their one purpose is to secure yourbitcoin whereas your phone hasyou know it's essentially a computer inyour pocket and with all of that extrafunctionality that your phone hascompared to a hardware walletincreases the theoretical attack vectorswhere hackers orthe nsa whoever can umsort of try and attempt to get theirhands on your bitcoin so these devicesare very focused andthey're focused at securing your bitcoinfrom physical attack um and also uh fromum digital attack ie uh you knowsomebody stealing your keys um over theinternet if you were to connect one ofthese devices to your uhvery likely highly insecure computerumso they a lot of them most of the goodones um work uh you know that theirprimary umway of of sort of keeping things secureis that they operate with what's knownas an air gap where they they canoperate without being connectedphysically to to any other device andbecauseit's that physical umconnection that sometimes can introduceuh uh intro um extrathreat factors so the the idea just todistill it here like the idea of ahardware wallet is that you have aa device that's builtto securely hold your bitcoin welltechnically it's holding the keys toyour bitcoinum butfor all intents and purposes it's it'syou can think of it as holding yourbitcoin and and it interacts with eitheryour computer or your phone in a waythat those keysall the keys are what protect yourbitcoin gives you access to bitcoin andyou don't want someone else to haveaccess to those keys it keeps those keysoff that computer or off that phone soit stays on the deviceand that device is never connected tothe internet sothethe basic concept behind securingyour stash with a hardware wallet isthatuh for someone to compromise you theyneed to physically have access to youand the device orif they can compromise the device justthe device but they like have to comeinto your home or come into your officeand get that device rather than hackingyou through the internetright and you know the even um if ageneric attacker was togain physical access to to most of thesedevices and they're still going to um afair bit of time and a hell of a lot ofequipment to be able to um you knowcrack theum protections on the device to be abletoaccess the keys um and to be able tosteal your bitcoin so it's not just acase of umprotecting you from a malware infestedcomputer um if somebody was to break inthere's still pin protection on thedevice and so it's not just a case ifyou lose the device um and you loseaccess to your bitcoin again the thepremise that matt spoke about beforeabout writing down your seed words um isexactly the same with a hardware walletuh the differences here is that um thethe when you sort of uh generate thosethose 24 or 12 words and it's done in anoffline environment that's never beenconnected to the internet so that againit just removes that extra threat vectorwhere um you're not connected to anysort ofinternet connected devices so it's justthat extra layer or wrapper of securityperfectumshould wewhat is your favorite hardware walleti saw that one coming a mile offum so full disclosure um i work for a umhardware wallet manufacturer calledfoundation devicesand obvious biases aside i genuinelybelieve that we make the umthe best option for a beginner enteringthe space umit's incredibly secure but also veryeasy to operate uh so i should havenamed the devices called passport andand another great device is the callcard umwhich is probably looks a little bitscarier to the newcomer i would say umbut has some extra features um thatmight bemore beneficial for more advanced usersthat they could sort of leverage sothose would be my two favorites yeah iwould say my favorite is uh cold cardumi've used multiple versions of coldcards i highly recommend them umand then ifwe're not really going to go intocoins here but if youabsolutely need to gamble onother coins in the space rather thanjust bitcoin uh both foundation and coldcard are bitcoin onlyumi mean so i i would say either use aledger or a treasureuh hardware wallet if if you wantcoin support um but even in thatsituation you probably shouldgo with a bitcoin only hardware walletfor your bitcoin and then use the otherones for your coins and just likethe mobile wallets there are lots ofreally bad harder wallets out thereso don't just googlebest hardware wallet because a lot ofinfluencers are paidtopromote them so you'll see youtubevideos with 500 000 views saying to usea horrible hardware wallet soconsider thatyeah what i would say just to back thatup again is that you know likelihood isif you're listening to this that you'reat least aware um ofyou know bitcoin twitter and the peoplethat are umaround and popular on there and most ofthose people have been around for a goodnumber of years and they've probablytried all of these devices so look towhat most most of theirmost of those people are using or atleast recommended and when you're sortof doing your own research to see whichdevice is going to be best for youperfectumwhen they're using their hardware walletthey need to use it with awith software they need to use it withan appso what are your recommendations forwhich apps they should use with theirhardware walletthe best two for meif you want to stay on desktop whichgenerally gives you sort of a little bitmore extra functionality would be numberone be spiral wallet um hands down myfavorite umor if you like a little bit of a sort ofeasier to to operate interface with kindof lessadvanced features spectre desktop isalso a great onetwo great recommendations spectre usedto be my favorite now sparrow's myfavoriteyeah um whichmight uh be a good segue for what we'vegot coming up next uh well before we getthereyou can also useyou can also use both the cold card andthe foundation passport with blue walleton mobile so if youare going through the steps and you gotcomfortable with blue wallet alreadyum because you started with a mobilewallet uh you can then use blue walletwith both of those hardware walletswhich is nice especially i mean i ithink some people listening to thisprobably don't have a computer that'sso a lot of people don't have computersthey just have the computer in theirpocketyeah you know we're heading towards amobile first world aren't we if not ifwe're not already there and blue walletdoesoffer a great interface uh especially uhwith with the with the passport with theqr interfaces uh very very slick andvery easy to wrap your head around as abeginnerawesome okay so you want to go to thenext topicyou said yeah let'slet's hit nodes yeah so i talked aboutum inspector desktop and one of thegreat features about like the desktop isit actually has a built-in bitcoin nodeso uh the next step along your journeyuh hopefully will be to look to run yourown bitcoin nodeum a bitcoin node is you can look at itas your umsort of interface into your into thebitcoin world and it's going to be thatnext step along the sovereignty journeyso that you can and again one of the thebuzz phrases that you hear in the spaceis verify your own transactionsand so when you receive uh any bitcointransactionand that will bebeing passed to you via a whole networkof nodesand the wallet that you choose to usewill be connected to a node now thatnode could be uma centralized node or operated by anexchange uh it could bea node that you don't know who existsthat might actually be a chainsurveillance company or hopefully itcould be your own node that you can runum in your house relatively cheaplynow the benefits of of running your ownnode like i said is you can verify yourown transactions so that you can be surewhen somebody's sending you atransaction and that the transactionabides bythe this sort of rule set umthat the the network that you've chosento join umthat we all agree on uh to put that alittle bit simplea little bit simpler is that you canbe sure that sort of nobody's trying tocheat you and send you some fake bitcoinor a transaction that's not valid and sothat you know you might be selling goodsor services and they might be paying youin bitcoin for thatandand if you weren't verifying your owntransactions they might be able to umsend you um the way i like to frame itis it's using your own note to interactwith the bitcoin network you have to usea node and if you don't use your ownnodeumyou don't have counterfeit detection isis like kind of how i like to view itsomeone can kind of trick youuh into it into thinking you havebitcoin when you don't have bitcoin soyou want to use your own node for thatpurpose and then second of all which ithink is almost more tangible to peoplebecause to be honest uh we haven't seenthat's more of a theoretical attack andwe haven't really seen it play out itcould still play out in the future youshould assume it it will so you want touse your own node for counterfeitdetection but second of all it alsoif you don't use your own node um you'retrusting your privacy with whoever'snode you're using so you want to useyour own node so that you don't have totrusta potential potentially a stranger or acompanywith that that private transactioninformation and balance informationyeah it's about removing trustessentially and and by running your ownnode you're you're putting the trust inthe hardware and or the the softwarethat you are choosing to run uh not theone that's kind of been given to you ifyou're operating with an exchange or acentralized node runner and so there'suma a massive awash of choice and withvarying degrees oftechnical abilitythe the easiest way to get running withyour own nodeis to download a piece of softwarecalled bitcoin corethis is kind of the the sort of uh defacto software built by the the bitcoincore developers uh that is essentially apiece of software that you can in acouple of clicks download onto yourlaptop or desktop and and it will startto download the your own copy of theblockchain so that you can umtransact with the built-in wallet andto just to get started and verify yourown transaction that way that'sabsolutely the easiest way and as itouched on earlier uh spectre desktopactually has umessentially that built in as well justpackaged in a slightly different way foryou and so they're they're absolutelyfree and within a couple of clicksyou'll be on the way to downloading yourown copy of the blockchain and havingyour own node set upthe problem with a setup like that isthat umyou i can't really um generally speakingconnect any mobile wallets to it so ifyou were to want to transact when you'reout and about and you run bitcoin coreon your laptopand you wanted to send the transactionthe likelihood is you're not gonna haveyour laptop with you so you you know youwon't be able to to spend as easily assome of the node options that we'regoing to come up come on to uh in asecond i'll just pause see if matt's gotanything to add thereumyeah so i mean if you're using bitcoincore or if you're using the built-inbitcoin core inspectoruh yeah correct your you can't the mainnegative is you can't use it with themobile wallet the also the othernegative isum your transaction and balance infowill be on your computer so if it'sa computer you use for work or acomputer you use uhto play games or look at porn orsomething like that your social mediahabitit might be easily compromised and thatbecomes a it becomes mostly it becomes aprivacy issueumbecause all your transaction historywill be there and all of your balancehistory will be thereum but also you can't use it with mobilewallets which is a key component as wellyeah so so the next best option um andunfortunately the most expensive optionis what's known as a plug and play nodeso this is where you'll buyessentially a small box from one of thevarious teamsto name a few we've got uh ronin dojowe've got raspi blitz we've got startnine uh umbrell there's loads ofdifferent companies or my nodeno nothere's loads popping up um all withdifferent feature sets but essentiallythey sell your boxuh that you plug in at home you plug itinto your router you plug it into thepower outletand then within a couple of clicksyou're off and running again to to getyour own copy of the blockchain and haveyour no your own node up and runningand before we move on uh civil dispatchuhcivil dispatch 26i had all the major node teams on for aconversation ontheir node projects so if you'reinterested in having one of thesepurpose-built boxes or you a lot ofthose projects that were just namedallow you to actually buy the hardwareseparatelyand then install their software on it umconsider listening to that sill dispatchright so and the the kind of finaloption is the diy approach like matt'sjust touched on where all of theprojects that we just said and we'llhave a parts list you can go away andbuyspend a couple hundred dollars buying ahard drive and a single board computerand a couple of other cablesand build your own node and put your ownsoftware well put the software thatthese teams provideand onto that hardware uh the the endresult is that you get um the same nodewith all the same features um obviouslythe caveat is that you've got to gothrough the process of buying thehardware yourself flashing the softwareand onto a micro sd card uh which mightcause you some you know if you're a lesstechnical user and you're lesscomfortable with taking that approachand that's why the teams offer theplug-and-play note it does sound moreintimidating than it actually isand i would absolutelyso like i encourage new users to gettheir feet wet um also juston thejust to go back a little bit aboutbitcoin core i mean if you're using youcan use you can also use bitcoin core ifyou're running bitcoin core on the samecomputer you're running spectre on or asparrow they both can connect to itumif you do that process you really shouldbe using it on a dedicated computer iknow i like kind of touched on thatearlier when i said you know if you'reusing it for playing games or socialmediait could get compromised easier becauseyou're using it for all these othergeneral purposes you're downloadingsoftware on it that maybe you haven'tverified you definitely haven't verifiedand have no idea what's really runningthereum so if you are going to go thatapproachyou should have a dedicated device youshould consider a dedicated computer adedicated phone that you are using withit um and uhyeah in general dedicated devices areare going to be more secure and moreprivate you'rewhen we when we talk about security andbitcoin land whereyou don't don't let perfect be the enemyof good don't get overwhelmed becauseyour setup's not perfect but at the sametime you're just trying toreduce your threats so that you're notthe lowest hanging fruit most of thetime when we see these hacks it'stargeted at the people that are mostvulnerableyeah and the just to go back to the diyapproach that was outlining umall of these uh different projects thatwe've spoken about have got reallyreally good documentation and quitevibrant communities as well uh ontwitter telegram or their own dedicatedforum and so don't be afraid to you knowgo and have a browser the documentationlike matt said it's not actually asscary as i made it sound um and also youknow go and ask some questions in the inthe telegram chat or in the slack orwhatever you know um chat room that thethe the project has gotum you'll probably find or you'lldefinitely find thatall of these the people that are inthese communities are really welcomingand they've definitely been in yourposition before now and and you knowthey they found uh the thought of thisreally scary a couple of years ago andyou know now they might be runningseveral diy notes so they'll be don't beoff-put by it100um i will echo that sentiment i wouldjust add a slight caveat that there arescammers in these telegram groups andthese chat rooms um they will often tryand impersonateuhpeople that are involved with theproject or other notable figures to tryand get you feel comfortable never nevergive anybody uh your seed words thosesecret backup boards never give themtheir secret backup boardsand you know always be skeptical ifsomeone in one of those groups tries todm you separately and tries to go into aprivate chat you know sometimes it islegit but you need to be extra cautiousin that type of situationyeah and and if somebody does don't beafraid to ask in in the sort of mainroom you know tag the person who youthink might have dmd you and said isthat his issue at the mme exactly butalways uh just act on the the on air onthe side of caution and and keep thatsort of adversarial mindset to think youknow why is this person reaching out tome completely out of the blue after ijust asked my first question enteringthe room100um so all those node projectssupport something called electrum serverand electrum server is a standardumit's it's a standard way to interactwith your own node um you can use thoseelectrum server details and then you canput them into sparrowyou can put them into many of the mobilewallets that we mentioned earlier youcan put them into blue walletwith samurai specificallythey don't use electrum server they usesomething calleddojoand with that pairing is as simple asthere's a qr code and you just scan theqr code with your samurai wallet on yourphone and it'll pair up with your nodeyeah the good thing is with dojo as wellis it's uh implemented in the vastmajority of the the note packages nowthere's there's more that have dojo thatthen don't which is really great to seeindeedshould we hit on the coin joinokay soi i just want you know we're we're anhour inum if you're a newcomer you just listento this hour and you're intimidated as uh don't be intimidated you knowstart with step one where we talkedabout acquiring your bitcoinumthen you know learn how to hold your ownkeys and slowly move through the processdon't you know freak yourself out thatyou know now now i gotta run a node toolike i'm now i'm really intimidated youknow step by step get your feet wet getcomfortable send transactions receivetransactions back up your wallet restoreyour wallet just get comfortable with itget used to it don't it's not somethingto be scared of it's something that youlearn by doingyeah i uh i put a tweet a couple ofweeks ago actually that kind of echoesthat that you know if uh sending atransaction uh makes you feel a littlebit uneasy then you haven't sent enoughtransactions um you can see on screenthere that the mempool is uh you knowit's a little bit busy than what it wasbut a couple of sats per bite is goingto get your transaction confirmed veryquickly and that's going to cost you youknow less than a dollar to send atransaction so we don't have we don'thave that on the list but before we moveon to coin join on chain privacyutxo management we should probablyhow does how does a newcomer choose whatfee to pay they open up their walletthey go to send a transactionumwhat like how do bitcoin transactionfees work i feel like that is somethingwe tend to gloss overyeah we overlooked that one um wellfortunately most of the the good mobilewallets especially the ones that we'veuh mentioned uh on tonight's stream uhwill give you a couple of options uhwhere you canum you'll they'll either have you knowthree options sort of low prioritymedium priority and high priority likeagain like we can see on screen or theremight be a slider where you can manuallyadjust the feeand essentially the the higher that thefee you pay the more likely that uh yourtransaction is going to be uh confirmedor processed quickeruh againa caveat with that one we've got a lotof caveats tonight is that umthe uh some of the estimation the feeestimations umthese wallets all use different sort ofalgorithms as to how they um calculateor estimate the fee that would berequired to get you confirmed in thedisplayed priorityso matt's got on screen here a reallygreatwebsite called mempool.spaceum which can it shows you again the thepriority uh fee selections uh or what itwould adviseand based on uh correct me from wronggame map but based on what's currentlyin the mempool um as well as sort ofhistorical data as well so it's kind ofaalways a really good sort of accuratelook at you know if you want to get yourtransaction processed within the nextblock uh right now it would take anestimate of 13 sats per byte um butagain there's a little caveat here thatthere's still umtransactions with much lower transactionfees umthan 13 sats per byte that will also getget confirmed so it's kind of umit's not an exact science uh i will saythatbut multiple sources is always a goodone if you want to try and uhget it sort of nailed so i mean bitcoinis a run by a companybitcoin is adistributed networkum and so as a result how bitcointransactions workiswe have this chain of transactionsand the transactions are within blockswe call them blocksumroughly every 10 minutes there'll be anew bitcoin block and it will havefinalized transactions included in thatblockuntil you get into a blockyou sit in a waiting list that waitinglistis we call that the mempool we call itamenpool technically every node hastheir own mempoolumbut if your internet connection is solidin most situations those mempools shouldall look the same so when you go tomempool.space you're looking at theirmempool that will look very similar toif you looked at the same thing on yourown node which a lot of these nodeprojects by the way allow you to runmempool.space natively with your ownnodesothebasically you have this like free marketthat's constantly going on where you'redecide wherepeople are choosing which fee they'rewilling to spend and miners are going tousuallyinclude you in a block based on yourorder in that waiting list based on howmuch you want to spendso if it's a transaction between someoneyou trust um and you're willing to waita longer period of time you can pay alower fee if you're sending just toyourself you can pay the lowest fee wecall that's one sap per byte is thelowest fee because you're just sendingit to yourselfum you know if if in some crazysituation where a one sapper by nevergets confirmed ever which we've neverbeen through you can always resend thattransactionso you're gonna want touh choose your transaction fee based onthe urgency you want that transactionfinalized on the networkand most good wallets will basicallygive you a low medium and highyou knowthislow being i can wait medium being likei'm in the middle ground because it'smedium and high being i don't want towait i want it finalized as soon aspossibleyeah andit'sit's a very much a dynamic thing it'slike a queue that's always evolvingevery single second because there's moreand more transactions being sent youknow every second andumit's not within you know outside therealms of possibility thatwhat the fee that you put up right thissecondmight not be enough to get youimmediately uh processed into the nextblock in sort of five minutes timeum so it's it's very very dynamic andyou know that's why i said it's not sortof an exact science so generallyspeaking for most people the walletestimators are pretty good especially ifit's an urgent transaction that you needto be processedimmediately100 i'm glad we covered that topicum also uhjust uh before we move on to the nexttopic just to jump backwith hardware wallets uhyou know the backup to that hardwarewallet are those words you wrote downumyou have the option of putting them intosteel these steel plates are availablemany different vendors offer the steelplatesand the idea there is if you put it intosteel obviously it's going to be waterresistant and fire resistant it's goingto be more sturdy than paperyou might also consider makingduplicates of those seed words andhaving them in different places so likeif your office burns down or your houseburns down it's still in the otherlocationwith the caveat that it meansit could be more likely that someoneelse finds it because it's in morelocations so you need to think aboutthat very carefullyand then third of all with hardwarewallets which i forgot to mentionone thing i like to tell new coinersis it's a good idea to have to buy twoof whatever you decide to buybecause if you have a second oneyou canyou can have the same backup wordsinitialized on both devicesso then if something happens to yourdevice not only do you have the seedwords available those those secretbackup words available to restore yourdevice you also have the second devicethat still has access to your funds soyou're not in a panic situationum so i always i tend to recommend topeople that they should buy two of thesame device whichever they choose umso that they they can have twoinitialize and you can keep those inseparate locations as wellif you wantokay yeah i think that's good adviceso when you're opening up a bitcoinwallet it shows a balanceum a common misconception isthatthat you know you just it shows yourbitcoin balance that's what's in yourwallet but in reality what's in yourwallet is basically a bunch of differentbitcoin transactions that all add up tothat balanceum we call those utxos uhthose those are unspent transactionoutputs utxos is what we call them youcan think of them like bills in yourwallet like maybe your wallet you knowyour cash wallet has50 in it but in reality it has two 20sand a 10and that's how bitcoin wallets work soyou have all these small utxos in therethat add up to your balance and that hasprivacy implicationsbecause ififtwo of those utxos come togetherum in a single transaction they'reobviously linked on this chainuh forever right we call it theblockchain it's this ledger oftransactions they'll be linked togetherbecause they were both spent in the sametransactionso that brings us to this idea of utxomanagementand coin control the idea oftrying tomanage thosebitcoin transactions in a privacy andcost effective way should you want to gointo that a little bityeah definitely um and quick i willstart with the two wallets that we keepmentioning blue wallet and samurai umoffer all the features that i'm justabout to cover that sort of help when itwhen it comes to to utxo managementandinspectoryeah sorry yeah i keep referring tomobile wallets but yeah the all of thedesktop uh the good desktop wallets thatwe've spoken about i've all got utxomanagement features as well um sothere's a couple of facets to it thefirst one is the ability to uh label thethe utxos or the pieces of bitcoin thatyou've got in your wallet so what wouldbe an example of a label might be thatif matt was to pay me for dinner uh orpay me back for dinner um when ireceived that transaction into my walleti could put a label on that to say thatthat's come from martin it was fordinnerum i could then receive my wages from myemployerumand i could put the the relevant labelon that just to know that where theorigin uhof that utxo is fromumso the once i've labeled themwhen i'm making future transactionsand i'mthere's two ways you can make atransaction you can let the wallet toconstruct it for you automatically whichthey might choose any random utxos andmerge them together again like matt saidto which will show common ownership thatmight not be a problem however if you uhwant to preserve your privacy and imight not want my employer to know thati'm friends with matt because he's a badperson um because i've labeled those i'mnot a bad person thoughbecause i play radical[Music]because i've labeled those utxos when ireceived them at the time um in you knowtwo weeks down the line when i'm goingto make a transaction um i can then chyou know consider and the person thati'm paying you know do i want them toknow that i know matt or do i want themto know that i work for the company thatpaid me uh with this utxo i can makethat informed decision then to say wellactually i'm just going to spend fromone of those pieces of bitcoin oractually it's not a bad thing matt's notreally a bad person i'm gonna combinethe two uh because the value that i wantto send i need to combine the twoum so those are the two two sort of mainfacets to it and and but obviously youcan't ummake a an informed decision when youcome to spend um if you don't know theorigins of all of the etxos that you'vegot and so they kind of go hand in handreally um you need to label so that whenyou come to spend you can make theinformed decision as to whether youshould merge or not yeah so a key aspectof bitcoin isif someone sends you bitcointhey can see where that bitcoin goes inthe futureand if you receive bitcoin you can seewhere that bitcoin came from in the pastsothis is why labeling is importantbecause you want to knowwhere that transaction came fromor it goes tobecausethat's who you're exposing your privacyto in that situationis that a good yeah installation yeahwhich you know um might not be a problemfor you know the person that i'm payingmight not um be able toor be clever enough to to use blockchainanalysis um but the other sort of umadversary that we need to consider hereis chain analysis firms that might betrying to umcluster or monitor your unchain activitywho you're spending to who you'regetting change back from uh to monitoryour habits to try and um piece togetherumyou know the identity because theblockchain doesn't have any identitiesat that at the blockchain layer um butthese companies work to kind oftie all the pieces together so that theycan um de-anonymize people and so it'snot just a case of umyou know hiding how much you earn fromyour friend uh it's also you know thesemore sophisticated actors that have gotmore a lot more resources to throw atthis and that you've also got to bear inmind as well unfortunately yeah you bothyou both don't want you don't want youremployer to knowwhat you're spending things onand you don't want the guy who sells youa sandwich to know how much money youmakebut on top of that we also have theseprofessional surveillance mercenariesthat work for governments dictators andcompaniesand they are just out there constantlytrying to track bitcoin transactions soyou also have that as a concernwhich leads us nicely onto coinjoin ithink if unless there's anything elseyou want to touch on no let's yep we cantalk about coinjoin now so coinjoin umis um acoordinated or collaborative transactionwhereyou and at least one other personwillcollaborate to construct the transactionthat casts some doubtas to theorigin and the output of the transactionto umto make suream thatstill could you still hear mei can still hear you yes oh sorry ithought i dropped out yes it's acoinjoin is a collaborative transactionwhere umthe the idea is that theuh somebody watching the blockchainagain chain surveillance firm youremployer your friend whoever they can'tumdeterministically orwith good probability be able to trackthepeople on the input side of thetransaction to the output side of thetransactionso it effectively attempts to put upsort of um a brick wall in your you knowthe the utxos history so that umanybody looking on chain can't be sure100umyou know is there one person involved inthis transaction is there 10 peopleinvolved in this transaction it justcasts doubt on the the uh path that thebitcoin has taken and and who sort of umyou know has the bitcoin change handshasn't it we we're not really sure so sotracking bitcoin is a probability gameumthese surveillance companies and theirtools will basically or just someonewho's curious and trying to spy on youum will basically assign a probabilityto every transaction if ownership haschanged because one of the things aboutbitcoin isyou know i could send bitcoin to myselfor i could send it to bitcoin q a anduh the chain doesn't delineate betweenthat so a key aspect of tracking bitcointransactions isumdetermining some kind of probabilitythat bitcoin actually changed hands andthen from there trying to seewhich hands it went from from who to whoum so coinjoin is this idea of acollaborative transaction and you canthink of it likeumjust for an example if you have fivepeople that are doing a coin jointtogetherinstead of uh having a simple path thatyou're following on chain and decidingif ownership has changed um all of asudden there's five different potentialpaths it could go downyou don't know which of the five peoplethat participatedwhich of their five outputs are themso it breaks that probability chainand it's a useful tool in terms oftrying torecr to have forward privacy have thisidea of someone who sent you bitcoindoesn't necessarily know which path yourbitcoin took going forwardyeah and specifically with umimplementations of coinjoin likewhirlpool which are known as equaloutput coin joints um the the the sortof notion is that everybody um on theoutput side all of the utx on the outputside of the transactionlook absolutely identical and soit's kind of uh i always like to use theanalogy of v for vendetta where you'vegot the million mask marchit's essentially the same thing but onthe blockchain where all of these utxosare indistinguishable from one anotherand so like matt said you've got someforward privacyand be quickand soi the the three major coin jointprojects our samurai whirlpool joinedmarket in wasabiumcitadel dispatch 15 was with the wasabiteam civil dispatch 16was with the join market teamand civil dispatchi don't know where he is i also did asamurai oneum is citadel dispatchit's there in your feed somewhere youknow uhstefan can just rattle them off he knowsexactly which one is which always amazesme that umi don't know which one it is i'll comeback to it and tell you but it's there'sthere's another dispatch with thesamurai team so if you're interested inthis uh consider going back andlistening to those threeumme and bitcoin q auh like samurai whirlpool the best youcan also you you don't have to usesamurai walla with it you can usesparrow wallet with it as wellumyeah yeah co-sign that samurai orsparrow a hands-down win is for me umespecially from a from a beginner'sperspective um definitely the easiestones to get started with in my opinionyou can continue on i'm trying to figureout which dispatchi'lli'll cover off one quick question that'sum quite on topic and somebody askedwhat's the difference betweenum coinjoin that we've just spoken abouton a coin tumbler so the unfortunatelythe words uh or the the meanings havebeen kind of umwhitewashed somewhat over the years butum generally speaking a coin tumbler isa centralized service where you willhave tosend inyour bitcoin and give up a custody of itto whoever's running the tumbler andthey will send you somebody else'sbitcoin backand i absolutely wouldn't recommendanybody use thesebecause you're putting yourselfum completely in the hands of whoever'srunning the tumbler and that you knowwhether they're going to send you yourbitcoin back or notand yeah soand you also not only you're trustingthem with your bitcoin if you use acustodial mixer it's the same ideas ascustodyum because custodial risks with walletsum you're also you're trusting them withyour privacy and your fundsum so the key aspect of coinjoin is isthe idea that you are reducing trust inany kind of centralized third party umwasabi and samurai have a centralizedserver that they doum[Music]that they use to coordinate the coinjoins to make them easier better uxuh and more reliablethose coordinators are blindedwith samurai specifically you can use itwithout your own node and then you'retrusting samurai's node so that goesback to our earlier conversation aboutusing your own node you should use yourown node when you use samuraiotherwise you are trusting them withyour transaction and balance informationas as is the case with all light walletsum i found it so so it's still dispatch15 is wasabi still dispatch 16 is joinedmarket and still dispatch 30 is samuraiso consider listening to thoseokay i think are we done on coinjsshould we move on to the next topic um ihave multisig as the next topic butshould we do lightning real quick firstsure thing yeah yeah i think it's apt umsoquick high level on what the thelightning network is uh it is a scalingsolution for bitcoin that umallows you toum transact with uhactual real bitcoin um but you don't doso with what's known as an on-chainfootprint and so it allows you to sortof lock up a small amount of well asmuch bitcoin as you want onto thissecond layer solution known as thelightning networkso that you can umyou essentially just defer the theoverall settlement um of any number oftransactions from going on chain to toreduce fees and also to allow you totransact um much quickerso whereas uh one on chain transactionyou know might cost you a couple hundredsats depending on the fees and you youmight be able to send you know 10or even 100lightning network um transactions forthe sameuh for the same amount of fees um nowthere is uhunfortunately lots of caveats with thelightning network again in terms ofbeing able to do it properly uh with uhthe best way to do so be with one of theuh no packages that we've spoken aboutbefore andwhich will dictate that you need tomanage your own sort ofyour own channels which is essentiallywhere you lock up this bitcoin to beable to to transact on this second layerumso it's a little bit more of a hurdle toto get on board with um but you you sortof can save yourself a fair bit on feesespecially if we ever see a feast bikeagain um which i think is inevitable umthe i don't knowinevitable um sofirst of all there's been a lot ofdispatches on lightning if you gothrough the feedconsider listening to those there's likea lot of different caveats and nuanceswhen using lightningspecifically with privacy i did a fullprivacy episode with openobs and anthonythat's still dispatch 21 that's onlightning privacyuh so consider checking that out but themain differentiation that you as a newuser should think about with lightningis going back to our transaction feeconversation earlierwhich iswhen you use a regular bitcointransactionyour transaction fee is not based on theamount you send it could be kind ofweird for youuh it's it's actually based on theamount of utxos that you useuh for the transaction it's based on thedata size not the amount of money thatis sentsoyou could end up sending a five dollartransaction with bitcoin on chain aregular bitcoin transaction and it couldcost the same as sendinga five million dollar transactionnow with lightningit's different the way fees arecalculated on lightning is based on theamount you're sending so that'll be morecomparable to something that you're usedto in traditional finance world where ifyou send more money you're going to paya higher fee you send less money you'regoing to pay a lower feenowuh moon wallet with 2us as we talkedabout earlier mobile wallet supportslightningand blue wallet supports lightning nowif you use blue wallet in its defaultstate with lightning it's going to be acustodial walletwhich i don't loveuh if you insist on using it use it witha small amount because they can takeyour funds you are trusting them withyour privacy um ifuhyou can also use blue wallet withsomething called lnd hub which some ofthese node projects offeri think umbral and my node offered idon't know who else offers it but if youuse it with lnd hub or your friend's lndhub then it's not custodial with bluewallet it's custodial with who's everrunning the lnd hub so if you run thelnd hub yourselfthen it's not custodialotherother lightning specific wallets onmobilethat you can use so moon does bothblue wallet does boththen there's lightning specific mobilewallets that are very good uh there'sphoenixwallet uh there's breeze walletumbreeze b-r-e-e-zcontinuing the bitcoin naming scheme ofusing words and spelling themdifferently um is there anotherlightning wallet that i'm missinglightningeclair as well haven't youwell claire is phoenixphoenixyeah why do they have two okay but yeahboth of those are good yeah one allowsyou to manage your own channels and theother one does it for youokay phoenix does it for youyepokay so forget eclair your new corneryou have phoenix and you have breezewallet or you can use moon or bluewallet and that'srather than for savings you should thinkof that more asokay this is like my spending wallet mytransaction fees are based on the amounti send i'm going to be sending smalleramounts umso i i might use lightning rightyeah i agree i'm quite a big fan ofphoenix um especially from a perspectiveof you know one that a wallet thatmanages the channels for you and i mightget a lot of for this in the chatbut i'm i'm a firm believer that mostnew users don't shouldn't strive todive head first into lightning withtheir own channels because it's it'sit's not easy it's not approachable andeverything that we've already discussedum in terms of holding your own keys umuh using coinjoin and and not using kycare far more important than uh strivingto get your own channels up and runningum quickly uh i don't know what youthink about that matt and i'm waitingfor the in the chat no i mean ithink i i i think umlightning on mobile uh with the walletswe just mentioned moon blueum breeze phoenixfor smaller spending amountsuh is very accessibleuh actuallyif you if you actually want to dolightning in a proper sovereign wayum that i would say is a more advancedthing don't get intimidated by it but ii think it's important for ourall-encompassinggetting started guide that we do mentionit it exists and what are the you knowdifferent trade-offs basically thetrade-off there is a little bit you'regetting less security uh you're gettingless reliability with lightning umbut you're getting lower feesfaster transactions all else equalum[Music]and it could be very useful in a mobilespending type of situationyeah i agreephoenix and brees really great ways toto get started with lightning that havesort of their own unique um trade-offsuh that kind of give the the best ofboth worlds from it from a new userperspectivewhen you compare them with umcustodial solutions like the defaultblue wallet or running your own channelsand that's one of theyeah i mean that's one of the reasonswhy i like moon so much like moon with2us has like different tradeoffsum it doesn't have a standardized backupprocessuh it's you know if if you'rea lot of big corners will say it's youknow not a lightning wallet but at theend of the dayit's not a lightning wallet because youstore all your funds on chain you're notstoring it in a proper lightning walletum but what's cool about moon isif you scan a qr code it could be alightning qr code or it could be aregular bitcoin qr code and it justautomaticallyfigures that out for youum and and vice versa yeah so so you canjust have you can have some spendingcash in your moon wall at muunand whatever whatever bitcoin qr codeyou scan it will send but it doesn'thave power user features it doesn't havethat coin selection that we were talkingabout with utxo management it doesn'thave labelingit doesn't have a standard backupprocessso these are all things to keep in mindright multisig multisig let's let's gohere's where we get into the weeds alittle bit um right so you've been inthe weeds for a whileall of the uh wallets that we've spokenabout umthe desktop wallets mobile wallets alloperate umon what we colloquially call a singlesig setup where they have um a singlesecret or backup um which is requiredwhen you want to spend your bitcoin amulti-sig wallet is where you combinetwo or more of theseseparate wallets together to create abrand new walletwhen you set up this multisig wallet youcan dictatethe minimumamount of keys required to be able tomake ato sign or authorize a send transactionso that could betwo from a possible three keys is apopular one all the way up to somethingelaborate like 11 or 15 you know whichmight be uh used in sort of a businesssetting props um but two of three whereyou need two signers from a possiblethree that were created to that we useto create the wallet to sign off on anytransactions from that wallet so whywould you want to do that wellwith a single sig wallet and some of thethree theoretical attack vectors ifsomeone's to someone but somebody was tosteal your deviceand and umwhile you know if they snatch your phonewhile it's out of your hand and you'vegot your wallet unlocked um they cansteal your bitcoin if that was one ofthe keys in a multi-sig wallet where youneeded two to spend from then they can'tsteal anything from youumanother one of the attacks that multisigprotect from is known as a retirementattack where there might be a malicioushardware wallet vendor thatdoesn't publish their source code um andthey umhave some uhmalware baked into into the the into thedevice and that is actually uh has theability to stealyour bitcoin i will say again correct meif i'm wrong game out but that has neverhappened again it's a theoretical attackbut if you were to use um a multi-sigsetup where you've got differenthardware wallet manufacturers if one ofthose is is maliciousum they can't get access to your fundsbecause they don't have you know if it'sjust one key out of two that arerequired they don't have the uhthe minimum number of keys required tosteal anythingall the goodall the good wallets all the goodhardware wallets are open source sotheoretically open source meansthat the code is available for you toverifyum and you can read the code line byline nowif you're a new coiner you're probablyup to this point you're already reallyintimidated you're like matt i can'tread codei'm aware okaysoat the end of the dayit is very good that you're able totechnically verify the code but mostpeople will be updating their hardwarewallets and they will not be verifyingthe code so there is some trust that youare you're trusting that hardware walletmanufacturer to not ship uh maliciouscode to you and you're also trustingthemuh that that the actual device wasn'tcompromised when it was first sent toyou right so with multisig the idea isyou can have multiple but specificallyin a hardware wallet ida hardware wallet multisig the idea isyou can have multiple vendorsuh that aremultiple different hardware wallets thatcome together to form your walletandyou needa combination of them as bitcoin q a wassaying a common one is two of three youneed two of them to spend the fundsthis reduces trust in any specifichardware wallet manufactureryou also have the added benefituh that those backup words instead ofthose backup words being aumone and done situation if someone findsthose secret backup words we call themseed words if someone finds those wordsthey have access to your funds in amulti-sig setup you haveummultiple sets of backup words and theyhave to find the required threshold ofbackup wordsin order to spend your funds so ifyou're using a two of three you're gonnahave three sets of backup words you'regonna have three hardware walletsthose backup boards obviously can be onsteel as we said earlierum and you can have them in differentlocations so bitcoin gives you bitcoinwith multisig gives you this uniquesituationwhere you can have a geographicallydistributeduh security setup where you're holdingyour own coinbutthethe the keys to access it can be locatedin different places they can beduplicated you can keep copies of themin different places and for someone toactually compromise you and take yourfunds they're gonna need to have accessto a combination secretwe lost bitcoin q a about two minutesago or a minute and a half ago and i'mjust gonna keep talking until hereconnectssothat is the main benefit of multisig[Music]do not once again do not get intimidatedhereuhplenty of people store bitcoin in singlesig uh setups it is thenormal way of setting it upum this is something you might graduatetouh multisig ux multisigumi guess ux can be kind of a complicatedwordlike the way you interface with themultisig walletis a relativelynew thing in bitcoinumso it it has a little bit more of alearning curve it is a little bit morerough around the edgessoyou want to get really comfortable withit as i said earlier you want to bebacking up restoring spending receivinggetting comfortable with it separatelyof your single sig setupnow one cool aspect of multisigis that you canactually have a single sig walletuh so you can be using a hardware walletthat is single sig and then you cantake that single sig and you canactually also use it in a multi-sigenvironmentandit can be one signer of for instance thetwo of three in the multi-sig but alsoit could also be its separate walletum andi guess the main advantage thereumi guess there's two main advantagesthere first of all if someone findsyour single sigback up your your secret words uh itmight have some small amount of funds onit and they think that's all your fundsthey they can't tell that it's in amulti-sig setupumso they might just take that funds andthink they took all your bitcoin umthis thesecondary benefit isthat you know you can repurpose thesethese hardware wallets and use them formultiple wallets now one other caveathere is with multi-sig you do want toback up additional information besidesjust your seed wordsumbitcoin q a came in and then left againso i will continueumthe popular multi-sig softwaresparrowspectre supports it blue wallet supportsitthey will tell you what you need to backup and make sure you save all thatinformation now that informationthat additional information that's notyour seed words umthey will have terms like derivationpathum descriptorthe list of something called x pubs youdon't necessarily have to know what allof that means you just have to save itand you just have to realize thatwhileseed words area security risk if someone gets yourseed wordsthat information that separateinformation that you have to back upwith a multi-stick wallet is a privacyrisk so if someone finds that they cansee how much you're holding in themultisig but they can't necessarilyspend itbut you need that information plus yourbackup boards in order touh to spend your funds bitcoin q are youbacki am apologies for that that'll happen ithink it's my networkno worries at all um i just continued onand i just kept talking about multisigdo you be holding it downumii get i mean i think we arei i think i sufficiently explainedmultisig tradeoffs and and benefitsumshould we move on to mistakes commonmistakesyeah did you cover sort of thealternatives to doing it yourself themultitec approach no i didn't that'sgreat why don't you go into thatyeah so obviously matt's just outlinedsome of the potential pitfalls withdoing it yourself umso one of the other options is known askind of collaborative custodyalternatives where um there will be acentralized service uhsome examples are on chain capital anduh casaumwhere they will help you coordinate amultisit quorum and where they hold oneof the keysand so that in the event that you wereto umso i'll give you an example you'd have akey on your mobile phoneyou'd have a key on a hardware walletand one of theseservices will hold the key as wellso they only have one key so they can'tsteal from you which is greatumbut if you were to lose say your phonewhat their key or the key on yourhardware while and he didn't have itbacked up they will be able to step inas a third party to help you move yourbitcoin so that in a doomsday scenarioand you um you don't lose your lifesavings which is really greatyou will pay for this service and againi'm not sure on how much each charge thebottom tier i think is just over 100umlast time i checked per year and one ofthe the trade-offs with this is that umunless you sign up uh without yourpersonal information which i believe isquite difficult to do umthethese uh centralized um entities thathold the key and part of yourmulti-sitcorum they know who you arethey know how much bitcoin you hold inthat wallet because they hold one of thekeys and they alsohold the sort of uhthe wallet file if you like to put itsimply and so that they canjust as a kyc exchange can umbe able to tie you to your bitcoinidentity so it's worth paying up thetrade-offs yeah and you're using theirnode sothe assumption is if you do this if youuse one of these providersuh you're trusting them with yourprivacy but they will hold your hand andthey will have a spare key for you aswellum and they will help you onboard intothe process they will help you gethardware wallets they will go throughthat whole process but you are trustingthem with your privacy they know yourtransactions they know your balancesandin 99 of situations they know who youare as well uh they'll know the ipaddress of your of your devices that youconnect fromthis is all kind of getting a little bittoo much into the weeds but the key isthat you're trusting them with yourprivacyum i was explaining earlier justbasically doing it yourself so you coulduse your own note and you aren'ttrusting someone in that situation youcan still haveumother people hold keys for you so abitcoin q a started with a two of threesetup because that's a very common setupbut another common setup is a three offive setup and if you do a three of fivesetup you have five total keys and youneed three to spendsoif you need three to spendyou can hold three keys yourself so thatyou know you have and you put them indifferent locations and you know youhave enough to spend it yourself butthen you can also have you know a familymember a frienda lawyerholdhold a key you can have differentcombinations of people hold the key soit can be very useful inum[Music]specifically in in situations whereyou're trying like inheritancesituations where if if you pass away youhave large bitcoin savings uh you knowmaybe a lawyer is holding one in a trustmaybe a couple family members areholding individual ones and theybasically all need to collaboratetogether in order to spend your funds ifyou have three keys with other peopleum but you can also do it in a way whereyou don'tyou don't they never have the thresholdthey need to compromise you pluscombined togetheryeah i think umjust one final thing before we move onto the next topic um inheritance is abig one for me that um i i sort of liketo drive over people who seem to seemkeen to kind of jump into the diyapproaches thatyou know you might have spent some timelistening to some podcasts watching someuh tutorials or reading some guides andfeel comfortable in setting up amultisigumsetup um but what happens if you're notaround tomorrow unexpectedly uh is yourspouse your next kin are they going tobe able to coordinate a spend from a twoor three or a three or five do they knowwhere to find the keys do they know howto recover it and if you answer no toany of those questions then uh all ofyour life savings disappears when youdisappear soand something to bear in mind especiallyif you're going to take the diy approach100 i'd also add that there's a middleground hereuh specifically supported by cold cardcalled seed xor and basically in thatsituation instead of having one seedit's not multisig but instead of havingone seed you have two seeds and you needboth of them in order to spend yourfundsso it's a little bit different thanmulti-sig it can be more accessible topeople uh because you don't have theseadditionalcomplications that we were justdiscussing with multi-sigbut it gives you that benefit of nothaving a single seedbackup wordsthat can be compromised by someonethere's also something that's supportedby pretty much every wallet out therecalled a passphraseand in that situation you have thesebackup boards are usually 12 wordphrases or 24 word phrases thepassphrase is the 13th word or the 25thword and you pick that yourselfso if you do that method then you cankeep the passphrase separate from yourbackup words if someone wants tocompromise you they need access to bothumand i mean if it's a weak passphrasethey might just take your backup boardsand keep trying pass raisesumbut it it adds an additional umburden on them to try and compromise youwithout going through a multi-sig setupum anotherinteresting thing about passphrases isyou can store money on the bear backupwords and then you cannot when you use apasswords it's a separate wallet soin that situation you can actually keepfunds on youryour basic backup boardsand then if someone finds that they'lljust steal those that money and theymight not know you have a passphrasewith the majority of your savings in itum so that's just something to keep inmindawesome do you want to cover off uh somesome common mistakesnext on the listyeah i think common mistakes is a goodspot to go nextuh so i've got quite a lengthy list hereandthe first one of which unfortunately iuhfell fell prey to a little bit um andthat is uh it comes back to our veryfirst pointof cape kycmultiple exchanges and without any realneed to really um so i've just uh sortof expose myself to you know put my nameon loads of different databasesand soit's an unfortunate one that you can'treally undo like we spoke about beforeand if you were to you know listen tothis podcast and decide that youumstill want to gofor a kyc exchange because you think youknow the task of going uh no care adviceandtry and limit your umyour exposure to this by just signing upwith one reputable exchange umi think that's a good one to start anddid youi think that's very good advice like ifyou are going to use a kyc service whereyou're providing your identityinformation you should choose itcarefully you should choose someone youtrust the mostand you shouldnot sign up for a lot of people justsign up for a ton of different servicesyou should only you should sign up forthe bare minimum ideally if you're gonnado it you sign up for oneyou use it solely just to buy bitcoinand then send it to your own walletsumand and you don't you don't use anyother additional kyc services you wantto limit that as much as possiblesecond thing is did you change your micsetup at all because it's way worse nowthan it was beforeuhhello i changed my computer um i'll havea player how much while you're talkingnow turn up is it just quietno we can hear you but it's just likebreaking up a little bit it's likecutting in and outall right i'll let i'll play aroundumanother common mistakeuhthat i see people make isi i mean gambling on coins so a lotof people will think that um bitcoin istoo expensive and i've missed the boatand i i'm too late to bitcoin umliterally every single person who hasentered bitcoin at any time in bitcoinhistory has thought they were too latethere's like a famous screenshot ofsomeone on one of the bitcoin forums uhlamenting that they didn't get in atfive cents and instead they got in at adollar and they were too late and theymissed the busum so everyone feels that wayuh you're not alone in that it'simportant to realize that you cantransact insmaller units of account we call themsatssoyou can you don't have to have a fullbitcoin you don't you don't you don'tneed like right now bitcoins at almost70 thousand dollars you don't need toput 70 000 and to use bitcoin uh satsare the smallest unit of bitcoin there'sa hundred million of themper bitcoin andright now sats you can get 1500 for adollar so you can send any amount ofsats you want to send you can send twodollars worth you can send 25 centsworthumit doesn't matter don't get caught up inin in thinking that bitcoin is tooexpensiveuhwhat common thing that these other coinswill dois they make it so they have so manyunitsthat it seems like it's cheaper than itis just to try and get you in the doorit's a it's a marketing tactic so justkeep that in mind uh q are you thereyeah how's my mic now oh so much betteri'm glad i brought it up perfect okay doyou have more common mistakesuh yeah common one um is just notpracticing umenough with transacting uh testing mybackups for my hardware walletstesting different wallets even usingtest net just practice practice practiceand getting comfortable uh using the thevarious tools that we've spoken aboutandgetting comfortable with it either usingtestnet which is basically uha copy a carbon copy of bitcoin that'shas that holds no value you can get itfor free onwebsites called faucets where you can goon and just mimic the normal behavior ofa walletand without the fear oflosing any real value and so you cansend some test net bitcoin to to your hardware wallet and youcan wipe it recover itand just to get really reallycomfortable with with that process sothatif um the worst was happening and yousomething was to happen to your houseuh where you say bitcoin wherever youstore your coin andyou're when you're in that packed stateit's not like the first time you touchyour hardware wallet for five yearsbecause you you know you've done thatyou know people call practice so you'vegot this lots of time if you send realvalue in there but it'sconnected to you and because you know ifyou're in a panic and you you need tomove your bitcoin quickly the last thingyou might be doing is doing itin unfamiliar uhsituation or in a familiarsituation wherebecause that's when mistakes happen andyou could uh muck something upyeah so we see that happen a lot whereyou know peopleuh so i actually don'tespecially for newcomers i don't know ifyou need to use testnetum it adds just anothercomplication to your processumbut but what happens a lot is likepeople will buy bitcoin they'll send itto a hardware wallet they never reallyuh get comfortable with itthen bitcoin goes up in valuesignificantly and like four years laterthey're trying to spend it and they'rejust not comfortable at allso you really want to get comfortablewith it you want to practice sendingreceiving backing up and restoring umand just you know i don't think testthat's necessary in that situationbecause you should just do it with thesmall amounts you knowuse you know send five dollars back andforthuh erase the wallet restore it from yourbackup see that your five dollars arestill thereum one nice thing about my earlierapproach that i mentioned if having twoof the same hardware walletis without putting funds at risk at allyou can load up one hardware wallet withsome bitcoinand then you can restore iton your second hardware wallet you canload up those secret words onto thathardware wallet and if your funds arethere and you can spend them then youknow you did the backup and restoreprocess correctly without actuallywiping the original wallet so that'sanotherbenefit you're basically verifying yourbackup and restore processyou don't want to be in a situationwhere you have a lot of moneyandyou have a lot of money on the line andyou've never done a backup you've neverhave you've never done a restoredprocess and you're just freaking out andmaybe you wrote down the words wrongi've had that happen to friends wherewe've had to guess the word that theythey wrote down wrong or wrote down inbad handwriting um so you don't youdon't want to be in that situation youwant to practice practice practicei think just to add to that uh backupprocess as well is thatmost of the umor the hardware wallets that we'vetalked about this evening havemultiple different types of backups aswell so i think it's worth noting thatpractice using both of them as well sowe've got the the siege words umboth call card and passport alsoofferingbackups as well where you can store itbackup onto a micro sd card um which is alittle bit easier to store and so iwould urge people to practice restoringfrom both methods as well becauseat the end of the day if again if in adoomsday scenario you don't know whichmethod of backup you're actually goingto have access to or which is survivedwhatever um you know doomsday scenariohas actually happened100um before we move on to more commonmistakes we have alex mccluskey in thechat asking about 401k ira fundsum if you're trying to hold bitcoin in aa in a in a tax beneficial way in yourretirement accounti would just keep this very simple uh ifyou do haveuh a 401k or an ira where you alreadyhave funds in it and you want to movethem into bitcoinjust consider using uh the serviceoffered by unchained capital that'sunchained.com disclosure they are asponsor of ofmy other show rabbit will recap thisshow does not have sponsorsumbut they're a sponsor becausethey're a good team it's a good productumi have friends there that are workingthere my buddy jeff andrew runs theirtheir retirement division and they willhold your handthey will help you through it obviouslyas we said earlier the caveat is you'retrusting them with your privacyum but pretty much in all situationswith retirement funds if you're using atax beneficial retirement uh methodyou're going to have to trust someonebecause it's all getting reported to thegovernment as wellthe nice thing about what unchained doesis you hold your own keys so you getthat tax benefit um but you're holdingyour own keys they can't spend yourfundsa lot of the other programs that are outthereumcan can spend your funds at will and youhave to trust them completely with thesecurity of your funds and your privacyso just something to keep in mindyeah the next one umfrom me is kind of a little bit moreoutside of the box umi lurked around on on bitcoin twitterand in some of the communities uh for alot longer than i really should have umwhen i started to uh interact with withpeople in the you knowwallet chat rooms or the no chat roomsand to use a few examplesmy knowledge grew exponentially fromthen onwards from having thoseinteractions versus me just sitting onthe sidelines and kind of you knowliking a few tweets every now and thenso if i was to go back and kind of havemy time again i i'd absolutely startgetting involved and start contributingand to the conversation much muchearlier because uh personally speakinganywaymy my knowledge just uh you knowskyrocketed compared to where i was justa couple of years ago and so big one forme that oneyeah that's uhand uh i just i think like learn bydoing right practice with small amountsumand get your feet wet rather than feelintimidated and feel like you have toread everything and listen to everythingand watch everything uhbefore you even get your feet wetyeah another one as well is and and mattmight roll his eyes at this one is iskind of going publicumthere there's a lot of value in instaying in the proverbial shadow so tospeak um i would urge people you knownot touh sort of start shouting from therooftops uh that they own bitcoin againbecause you know we talked earlier aboutkyc and how we kind ofcan paint a sort of red cross on yourback a little bit well shout from therooftops um when bitcoin hits anall-time high to all your friendsand might uh inadvertently do the samething one day um you know yeah 100 alittle bit jealous you never know he'sgoing to get jealous andtell somebody else you tell somebodyelse who'san individual that might want to try andget their hands on it soum i would be be candid about who youwho you speak to bitcoin about and it'sa bita double-edged sword that one because uhi think we've all got a little bit of apersonal responsibility to try and helpon on board others as well so um alsosay just kind of be selective about whoyou speak to it and what you sayyeah it is um it might sound a littlehypocritical coming for meum as aas as a as a public bitcoin figureumbutdefinitely in the beginning you shouldnotyou should you should not be talking youshould try and reduce how much you talkabout bitcoin don't make it obvious thatyou own bitcoin don't post on socialmediauh consider using a name like bitcoin qa does i mean it might surprise you buthe wasn't born with that namehe decided on that name himself for theinternet for his bitcoin workumin the future if you do want to becomemore public about ituhyou can do so in a moreresponsible wayum rather than doing it right in thebeginning you can never come back fromit once you do itum so it's something to keep in mindyou should never talk about your ownbitcoin you should never talk about yourown how much bitcoin you haveumthese are best practices uh you don'tyou don't uheven if it's a friend or a family memberit might seem like small amount todaybut in the futureuh it could be a large amount and theywill not forget it they tend to rememberone of the first questions mostfriends and family will ask you is howmuch bitcoin you own they love askingthat questiondo not answer it explain why you don'twant to answer it for themumif people do know you own bitcointhis is where that multi-sig setupreally shines because you can have itgeographically distributed you can haveyour keys in different locations um thatare far away from each other that makeyou getting compromised more difficulteven in a physical attack situation andobviously it is more ideal to live in aplace where you haveum proper gun rights and you can defendyourselfumso these are things to considerum if i was to do it againi probably would not be uh you know aspublic as i am about bitcoin um i made ajudgment calllater on in my bitcoin journey that ifelt we needed more public bitcoinfigures that were talking about realissues and specifically privacy um so imade that judgment call but there aresome mornings that i wake up and regretitumbut there are precautions you can takeand there are benefits though to beingsemi-public about your bitcoin usage uhmeeting people i've met some of the bestpeopleyou know i have i have basically i havefamily now that wouldn't exist otherwiseum but these are all things that youshould considerum as part of your bitcoin journey butin the beginningvery very very stronglywould sayyou know keep keep it as discreet aspossibleum you never knowyou knowyou you don't want to expose yourself toa malicious actor your government couldturn on bitcoina foreign government can use thatinformation against you uh if you'retraveling across a border or somethinglike thatso you you want to keep this in mindyeah the final um sign off one for me umwould beuhi just completely got out of my brainuh what is another two fa is another onea good one to touch on i think um yeswould be um if if you and it's just comeback into me now so i've got two tofinish off um if you again listen tothis podcast decide that no kosc is notfor you and you want to sign up for anexchange and a lot of these exchangeswill prompt you to use uh sms-basedtwo-factor authentication to um i'musing air quotes here to secure youraccountum this is where you'll get a textmessage to when you try and log into theto the exchange they'll send you a textmessage to authorize that login um therehave been multiple umuhinstances where this has beenexploited people have had theirinformation and their accounts hacked onthese exchangeswhich if youunfortunately have got funds on thataccountcan be withdrawn to whoever's got accessto your account they can withdraw it totheir own walletanda better alternative and would be to usean app-based uhtwo-factor authentication so an examplewould be umthere's one called anduh there's one called a edgiest uhthere's another one called um help meout here matt i've drawn a blank umuh did you say agesyeah i said aegis yep aegis is myfavoriteany app-based one and far more secureand there's been far f well aegis isopen source aegis is open source uhthat's a e g i s and the backup processis very easy you got to remember whenyou when you use these authenticatorapps umif your phone dies you want to make sureyou have a backup of themso yeah the most popular one is googleauthenticator and it's notlast i mean i haven't used it inmaybe six years or something like thatbut previously it wasn't easy to back upso make sure you're using one that iseasy to back upand back it up and keep multiple copiesyeah or the other alternative is you canget umlike a physical device that acts as yourthe second factor authentication lookslike a bit of a usb key that providesthe the additional authorizationbut less services tend to umoffer compatibility with those100umi i would say i think for most peoplethe physical device is overkillum can a sophisticated attackercompromise a phone base two factoruh yesum have we seen any widespread cases ofthat no do they still need your emailand your password yes umon that note you shouldn't be using thesame emails and the same passwords indifferent placesum if you go to haveibinpone.com you canput your email address in and it'll tellyou wheneveruh database gets leaked with your emailor your password or your personalinformation um so that's a veryimportant resource but but what we see alot of times is like there'll be like aleaklike maybe facebook will get hacked andthose emails and passwords will then beused at all the other services to tryand get into your accountum so that two-factor code gives you anadditional protection on top of that butyou really shouldbe trying to limit reuse of emailaddresses and never reuse passwords umyeahuh yeah there's one in the chat scoobysnacks asking is a password manager agood idea yes definitely would recommendit to anybody my personal favorite isis bit warden again another free andopen source uh software they do offer apaid version as well but the thefreemium uhoption is perf is perfectly good enoughfor for uh 99 of users i would sayyeah bit warden's great um you justgottaif you're using a password managerum there's some nuance there because ifyou're not self-hosting your passwordmanager you're using awhat's the main onelastpass people love lastpassumit's closed source you're kind ofputting all your eggs in one basketuhso there's some concern there you knowif you if you have all your passwords inthis password manager and that passwordmanager gets compromised then all ofyour accounts are compromisedumwhat i think is like a veryuh easy accessible thing forumnew users or people that are concernedis is your really important passwordsyou can just write them in a notebookyou write them in a notebooksomeone's going to need to get access tothat notebook physically in order tocompromise youumyou might not want to write it outcompletely clear you know maybe somethings you remember versus some thingsare on the paperyou can develop your own like kind ofcode system don't over complicate ityou'll probably forget the passwordum[Music]but uhpaper and pen paper and pen is a triedand true methodyeah absolutely and then just don't putit on athe final one that went out my headbefore um waswe've spoken about uh you know there's alot of information the past couple ofhours umdon't try and uh do everything in thespace of a week especially if you areliterally at step one um i would sort ofpick one of these topics you know wespoke about them in aumin a specific order for a reason and iwould urge people to sort of start fromstep one and try and master each stepbefore they move to the net before theymove on or at least not try to do toomany of them at the same timedepending on the approach depending onthe the approach that you take for thedifferent tools that we've we've spokenuh you know to do it properly and to doit justice and to understand it andpractice it like we've been like we'vebeen sort ofreiterating it's gonna take you you knowum a good bit of time you're gonna haveto dedicate some time to do this and tomaster some of these tools so trying todo too much too soon is setting yourselfup to to fail so take your time uh beum deliberate about it and and sort ofmaster something then move onyeah and our i that's great advice andas bitcoin q a said our order in thisepisode was intentionalso don't feel like you have to gothrough all the steps at once butgo throughthat order was how we we we chose thatorder specifically because we think it'sa very um[Music]efficient effectiveuh managing trade-offs and stuff balanceof what order you should kind of becoming into this um we also have someperson in the chatum who uses the nim some person so everytime i call him out in the chat i soundlike i'm just don't care about his nameuh asking for the best a two-factor appfor ios i really like authenticator plusfor ios users um i think it's availableon android as well but if you're onandroid i really just like aegisumso yeah there you go for that answerum i have on this list bitcoin q a ihave common questions do you have commonquestions that you have in mind orum i've got nothing noted down but kindof umoff the top of my headum a common one that i get is sort of uhis umis this setup good for me or is thiswallet the one i should useuhyou know insert service or or tool hereyou know is this goodum it's the thing with bitcoin and andusing the tools properly that we've beenspeaking about is thatwhat matter i might recommend from ourown personal experiencesmight not be perfectly applicable toyour own personal uh throat metal threatmodels or skill set um soagain we we have kind of covered thisground a little bit earlier but is umjust try things out um you know by i'mnot saying don't come to the people imatter myself and ask for advice youknow we're always um more than happy toto to help out um but the best thing todo is to sort ofget your hands dirty and try these toolsyou know you can do it for for free orfor a very low fees at the moment andjust testing out wallets or or differentdevicesor multi-sig setups if you want to gothat far coinjoin implementationsumbest thing to do is get your hands dirtyget get amongst the communities and youknow what's perfect for one person mightnot be perfect for another so umit's a bit of adyor do your own research and getcomfortable with what's going to workfor you really100 um just to reiterate umbitcoin q a has all of his guides atbitcoiner.guideumi have a list of resources and tools atcivildispatch.comhelpat the top of civildispatch.com help ihave also i have links toboth bitcoin q aummyselfand our buddy katan from australia whoruns ministry of nodes offers uhwe offer private one-on-ones and there'slinks to all of that at the top ofcivildispatch.comhelpum so if you dofeel that you you have the need for aone-on-one a specific time to jump on acallum that is available to you as well ihighly recommend both bitcoin q aand and katan uh for that and that's whythey are at the top of that pageumi thinkuh narwhal tacos has an interestingpoint i i kind of touched on it but ifelt like it was a little bit too earlyin the episode so i didn't go heavy intoitumhe's asking have you explained that noone actually holds their sats in a wallat just the key it took me a while towrap my head around thatthat is absolutely correctum you're not actually storing yourbitcoin you're storing the key thatallows you to access and spend yourbitcoin um so when we talk about allthese wallets when we talk abouthardware wallets and mobile wallets it'sreally uh either piece of software apiece of hardware that is that isstoring that secret key for you andallowing you to easily access that soyou can access your bitcoin um i thinkthat's an important point but i i do iwould say thatthat's almost more of ai don't know i i feel like it's more ofan advanced thingfor all intents and purposes you cankind of operate under the assumptionthat you're holding your bitcoin in thewallet butum it is a good it is a good point thankyou narwhal tacos um i think with allthat said it doesn't seem like we haveuh any any additional questions in thelive chat i would add that obviouslythis is still dispatch 43 there's been42 other episodes filled with contentum well that's a lot more advanced thanthis so if you want to dive into thatafter listening to this obviously feelfree to do that it's all available forfree without ads or sponsorsum q a you have any any additionalthoughts here before we wrap upi just want to reiterate just getamongst the communities use the toolsget your hands dirty don't be afraid totry things out um come to myself or mattfor any help and advice and just oneother you know we've mentioned katan umone of the prominent educator in thespaces uh btc sessions got a fantasticyoutube page that's got guy video guideson using literally everything to do withbitcoin so um if you're more of a visuallearner uh check out his youtube channelit's a fantastic resource as well 100that is also linked at civildispatch.comhelp or you can just search btc sessionson youtubeum i made him a channel on bitcointv.comi don't think he has uploaded anythingtherebut there's also a ton of great contentat bitcointv.com that is curated one ofthe issues and the pitfalls you shouldkeep in mind when you're on youtubeumespecially the high view count videosare filled withscams and bad advice um so you need tobe very careful uh you know if you'rewatching a btc sessions video it mightrecommend another video that looks likeit's reputable and that a lot of peoplehave watched and recommended ityou need to be very carefuluhat the end of the day bitcoin's aboutpersonal responsibilityumso no one's gonna be there if you loseyour bitcoin there's no getting it backuh and there'sthere's a lot of money to be made givingbad advice and showing bad productso you really really need to beskeptical all the timethink for yourself make your owndecisions and constantly keep learningand i want to be very clear herethat i'm not asking you to trust meeitheror bitcoin q a or catan or anything elsewe've mentioned in this video in thisvideo or any of the other civil dispatchepisodesyou need to constantlyfigure out things for yourself and makeyour own judgment calls if anyone'sasking you to trust

bitcoin onapple pay here's what he saidit's something that we're looking atit's not something we have uhimmediate plans to douhfori would sort of characterize it as thereare things that i wouldn't dolike umuh our our cash balancei wouldn't go invest that in crypto uhnot because i wouldn't invest my ownmoney in crypto but because i don'tthink people buy an apple stockto get exposure to cryptoand so if they want to do that they canthey can uhuhyou know invest directly in crypto orthrough other meansuh and so i wouldn't do thatand i'm i'm not planning to in theimmediate future to take crypto for ourproductsas a as a mean of tender uh but thereare other things that we're definitelylooking at like whatuh like i wouldn't want tohave anything to announce todaywell let me ask you a different questionbecause you just said that you might notdo it personallydo you own crypto in any bitcoin orethereum would you play around with thisi i do yeah i think it's reasonable toown it as a as a part of a diversifiedportfolio and i'm not giving anybodyinvestment advice by the wayso[Music]happy bitcoin tuesday freaks it's yourboy matt o'dell here for anothercitadel dispatch the interactive liveshow

namemy opinion is odell it's very easy torememberum so with all that saiduh we got a repeat guest here bitcoin qa good friend um and our plan is to tryand do an episodeuh have a conversation herewhere it's all encompassing from startto finish new new bitcoin are cominginto the space trying to do things youknow the right way trying to do thingsin a secure wayumand and just have it all in a singleepisode have it all in a singleconversationso as i was saying earlier the writerdies that are in the live chat um if youhave questions put your questions in ifif you're not a beginner and you'relistening in and you think we missedsomethinguh feel free to put that in the livechat as well and just a reminder thelive chat is accessible through thetwitter twitch and youtube streams andthey all getfed into uh the main chat so with allthat said i'd like to introduce bitcoinq a how's it going bitcoin q ahey matt it's going good thank you forhaving me back on uh it's been a while ithink um episode number two was now withthat with ergo so uh yeah lookingforward to getting back to it and uhrunning through some some of thebeginner-focused uh stuff that seems tobe missing from some of the podcasts uhfloating around me to tend to get jumpinto the weeds pretty quickly sometimesdon't we yeah i mean i have a feeling weare going to also be jumping into theweeds but we're going to try and do itin a nice constructive path into theweedsyeah i need you to keep me uh keep me incheck on that onebut yeah you are a dispatch lg it hasbeen it's been a minute and uh we'vewe've both been through a loti like to see like to think that we'vebeen through it together and uh yeahjust uhlove that you're back joining us and youknow i hope it's you know not just thesecond time it'll be many more times inthe futureumso with all that said freaks uh we havea bit of a structure that we set up forthis episode which is unusual fordispatch but i think it'll keep usmore focused um and so we're going tostart withactuallygetting bitcoin for the first timeum so do you want to you want to startwith that bitcoin q ayeah so uh it's buying bitcoinsnever been easier than it is todaythere's uh exchanges popping up all overthe place every every man in this dogseems to beuh giving you the opportunity to to beable to buy bitcoin from within theirecosystem or their appumthe the kind of elephant in the roomunfortunately and uh is is the um knowyour customer or kyc is it's uh it'slovingly called within the spaceumkyc is a regulation that essentially anysort of businessentity that has a banking relationshiphas to abide by that kind of dictates umthat they must collect certain pieces ofinformation from anybody that they givea service to obviouslyin the context of bitcoin that's anexchange that sells you bitcoin fordollars pounds yen whatever yourjurisdiction isumso in practice that looks like if youlike go on the cash app and you try andsign up to cash app to buy bitcointhey require you to upload your id youraddressuh i'm not sure some some servicesrequire like a selfie um that's whatwe're talking about right here which isthis identification information that'srequired when you sign up to one ofthese regulated servicesright and some of these are some ofthese exchanges now are even doing uhvideos where you they take that like a3d scan of your face which is kind ofscary really andso with all that said why why is thatkind of um why is that sort of a badthing that that people like matt andmyself sort of try andumwarm people away from or at least paintthe dangers clearly for everybodyeverybody um so when you supply thisinformation to to be able to buy bitcoinin a you know a really sort of easy andstress free way you know cash apps agood example where you can just in acouple of clicks get some bitcoin into awallet that you controlbut one of the main problems is that youknow all of this information getsrounded up into a centralized databasethat's controlled bythe entity that you're doing businesswithum unfortunately these entities or someof these entities they won't toureverybody with the same brush um don'thave a great track record of uh securingit effectively umtalk about perfect timing we we heardabout um a hack with uh robin hoodyesterday was it it was seven millionusersseven million users uminformation has been leaked um nowthere's varying degrees of the severityof the leak some of it's just emailaddresses uh some of it's more personalinformation like banking details etcumyou know to name a few others equifaxfacebook t-mobile clubhouse linkedinuh coinbase ledger um all of thosecompanies umrequiresome form ofof your personal information to to dobusiness with them and and they've allhad hacks where again with varyingdegrees of severity that um somebodythat shouldn't have got their hands onyour information did so i'm you knowwhat we're not talking small fry heresome of these uh hacks were in to thetune of millions and millions of ofpeopleum now you know if that's something likefacebook and your uh email address getsleaked you know it's not really the endof the world it might piss you off alittle bitwhen you tie that into umsomething like bitcoin wherehopefully especially after you'velistened to this podcast and you're sortof securing your own wealth that mightbe uh in your house that might be in aloved one's house or a combination ofthoseif uh if if the wrong person was to gethold of this information you know yourselfie your home addressum indicate in the case of coinbase howmuch bitcoin you've actually boughtthat is umessentially painting a very large crosson your front door that ummight make it inviting to the wrong typeof people to come and pay you a visit tosee if they can relieve you of of thosesatsso that's one of the main umyou knowuh reasons that that i personally tryand sort of make people aware that yesgoing on to cash app or coinbase orwhatever is is you know they make itreally really simple they've got reallynice polished uis to to be able to goand umget some get your hands on some statswithin it within a couple of clicks umit'syou know one of the big big risks isthat this information is leaked on aregular basis and there are companies inspace that to their credit and haveyou know they've nev never umbeen fallen prey to one of these attacksand but unfortunately they do seem to becoming um more and more uh frequent umso yeahthat's one of the main risks with kyc soyeah i mean i would add a couple thingshere uh first of all even if you know acompany hasn't been compromised yet weshould basically operate under theassumption that they will be compromisedin the futureumthis information once it is taken isoften soldto other people as wellit can be combined with otherinformation that was leaked from otherdatabases so for instanceumif you know you you have the facebookleak and the facebook leak has yourmailing address in it and then you havethe ledger leak and your ledger leak hasyour email address in it but thefacebook link also had your emailaddress in it they can combine those twouh leaks to get your full email addressand your actual in-person addresssecond of all we've seen umwe've seen physical attacks happen topeople who were known bitcoiners and howmuch bitcoin they had uh sometimes itwas because of these leaks it's hard totell for sure sometimes it's becausepeople just talk about their bitcoin andhow much bitcoin they own which you alsoshouldn't doumthird of alluhthis information can obviously be usedagainst you by your own government itcan also be used against you by foreigngovernments in the future obviously itis painting a target as you are someonewho owns bitcoin and uses bitcoin andexactly how much bitcoin you haveuh and then fourth of all in thecoinbase league specificallyumall of your withdrawal history was alsoleaked so uh it can be used to trackyour future bitcoin transactions uhbased on that information and we will gofurther in onon bitcoin privacy and trade-offs ofbitcoin when using bitcoin trying to useit privately how to go about that inlater on in this episode but these arejust things to keep in mindright so you know all of which is issort of incredibly scary um and theother thing final thing odds aboutbefore we sort of look onto thealternatives is that you know umsomething that i like to sort of keep inmind and remind people is you knowbeing here for number go up is great youknow i'm not going to sit here and saythat um i don't like to see us hitall-time highs all the time um butbitcoin is also umcreated to be able to make thetransactions that they don't want you tomakenowif you're sort of uh tying all of yourbitcoin to your personal identity umyou're you're kind of putting a inyour armor before you've even startedthat you know if you do want to makethose purchases that umbitcoin allows you to make um due to itspseudonymity thenyou're sort of starting two steps backby tying your your bitcoin holdings toyour personal identity um which is wheresort of buying from a new kyc source itcomes in so that you can have umsome or hopefully you know in a perfectsituation all of the bitcoin that youownso before we get there before we getthere just one more thingkycthese records are forever once once youdo these records you have to assumethey're foreverum is it best practice to delete anaccountum i you know if you're no longer usingit yes but you should assume that actualdatabase record hasn't been deleted umand it might be used against you in thefuture um so these are things to keep inmind umnow let's move to okay so if you'retrying to avoid kyc you don't want touse one of these regulated services whatare your optionsright so the the sort of uh two mostcommon ones that kind of get bannedaround in terms of actually purchasingbitcoin um is bisque uh which is apeer-to-peer uh decentralized exchangewhere you essentially it's a maker takermodel where somebody will want to umsell some bitcoin and they will go on tobisque and they'll say you know i wantto sell uh x amount of bitcoin for thismuch um you know 500 whatever and andthen you as a buyer can go on to thatsort of uh peer-to-peer marketplace andand look for these offers to see onethat sort of fits your bill that youknow was is within your price range andyou know the amount that you want to buyyou can go on completely and honestanonymously and and sort of take theirtheir sell offer so that you can buythat amount of bitcoin from themumthis isbisqyep so it's an application that you justdownload onto your computer basicallyyou run it all locally uh you knowthere's no personal information youdon't need to show any id's to sign upthe only person again depending on thepayment method that you use you knowthere's many many payment methods umsome are better from a privacyperspective than others and but let'ssay you knowmost people are going to go on and andif they want to sort of be able to takea wider range of offers from you knowmore people across the world they'regoing to want to use the banking systemwhich you know might ring some alarmbells to some other people listening butumwhat also i say is what's worse issharing your banking information withone person who is very likely to wantvery likely to be a privacy preservingindividual because they you know theyprobably wouldn't be using bisqueotherwise versus uh the regulatedentities that throw all of yourinformation into a centralized honey potthat we've just explainedum so that's one way you know some ofthe more private options that areavailable on bisc umare sort of postal money orders whichyou know i don't really know great dealabout um because it's a u.s centricthing um but you've also got cash in themailand then there's various various otheroptions that are kind of uh relevant totheir sort of jurisdictionsumanother option as well is huddle huddlewhich worksquite similarly to the way i've justdescribed with bisc and the thedifference being is a huddle huddle iskind of a centralized company um thathosts uh the sort of buy and sell uhlocations for you you know it's awebsite huddlehuddle.comum where you can go and sort of makeoffers or you can take offers again inthe same fashion umso so there may be some uh other alarmbells are in game where thinking whereum well what happens if i go on tobiscor to huddle hollow um and i youknow take this buy offer and i sendsomebody some some you know us dollarsand what's to stop them from just neversending me the bitcoin so both of theseservices um work on what's called anescrow system where the seller will haveto deposit the bitcoin first into amulti-sig wallet that is controlled byum by the buyer the seller and the sortof centralized entity um so thatbasically they theyuh can't sort of run off uh once they'veyou know got hold of your dollarsbecause they have to deposit the bitcoinfirst and and you'll be notified to waituntil you send any of the payments sothat they've proved that they've sort ofdepositedthe bitcoin into that um there is stillsome risk there but it's a reduced riskyeah absolutely you knowit's kind of i would say it's more of agrief and attack than ayou're not really at risk of losingfunds it's more of a um going throughthe arbitration process to prove thatyou've sent the dollars so that you getthe bitcoin back in the end so it'sgonna be more of a headache more than arisk to to actually lose any uhany cash would you sayyeah more or less umsoyeahcontinue so some of the other options umif youuh you can buy from bitcoin atmsthere's a really great website calledcoinatm radar.comwhere you can go on and punch punchingyour physical location i would recommenddoing sousing a vpnand and it will tell you all of thebitcoin etms thatare in your local area the the generalpremise of these is that you uh walk upyou can deposit some cashuh give it a um bitcoin address uhhopefully from a wallet that you controlwhich we're going to come on to laterand the bitcoin will be depositeddirectly into that wallet that youcontroluh there are again as is always the casewith bitcoins from caveats um justbecause you're depositing cash doesn'timmediately make bitcoin atm superprivate depending on the umthe brand of atm machine that you usesome of them do still ask for id um butthat is uh distinguished on the websitei've just said which is callingatmradar.comright some ask for id and thenand then some ask for just a phonenumber some ask for bothyeah which and obviously the the onesthat just ask for the phone number arethe better ones because you can spoofthat with services like textverified.comwhere you can just get kind of a burnernumber uh to satisfy the atm's umuh you know phone number requirementsbut obviously that's not tied to to yourpersonal identityum and then before we continue before wecontinue since we're still like early inthe episode and i should have mentionedin the beginning uh bitcoin q a has uhmy favorite guides in the space so ifyou want to look up somethingspecifically or if you prefer readingum if you go to bitcoiner.guidehe has all of his guides listed there sojust keep that in mind okay continueyeah pretty much everything that we'retalking about i've got some uhsome form of information on it um soyeah moving on to other noko i seeopportunities um so we've covered uhpeer-to-peer peer-to-peer exchangeswe've covered atms and the the next sortof option is to uh is to earn it umwhich might sound a bit outlandish tosome people are new and entering thespace but also we'll say is thatumeverybody has some form of a uniqueskill um and there's always going to besomebody who needs umwhat you can offer them uh it's justabout sort of uh trying to build up abit of a reputation whether that's inyour local area or online and so thatyou canyou knowsell your time or your skills andknowledge um and receive satsin in in repayment for themand the other option again probably notas much of a beginner optionas i would like it to be but the otheroption is to mine itumalthough home mining does seem to begoing through somewhat of a renaissancewhich is really really great to see andso the the general premise of that isthat you canbuy a bitcoin miner you can plug thatinto your um outlet at home plug in anethernet port connect up to to a miningpool and stream yourself somesecret sats or some private no kyc satsuh directly again into your wallet thatyou control umthere's been you know a fair bit of foodbanded around that home mining is iskind oftoo difficult or it's too expensive umthe the thing i would say is that yeahit's very much dependent on yourelectricity prices um but again you knowthis this shows fairly us centric andthere's a lot of places in the u.s whereyou know and if you'reum earning anywhere less than i thinkyou knownails in the chat they'll probablycorrect me on this but i think you'reprofitable mine at the moment anywherebelow 30 sats 30 shots yeah so i meanwith with all of these techniques youmight be spending a little bit moremoney than you would beum if you went through one of theseregulated services um you'rethe way i justify it is i mean you'reyou're paying a little bit of a premiumfor privacyand you're paying that for privacy goingforward too so it keeps paying dividendsuh with mining specifically mining homemining is a fantastic wayuh in my opinion ofaccumulating kyc free setsumit's really nice because once you haveit plugged in it's just constantly goingyou don't even have to really thinkabout it just constantly bringing inmore sets um we already have two wholemining umcivil dispatches so if you go back ifyou go to civildispatch.comor if you go through the podcast feed orif you go to bitcointv.com and ourplaylist over there you can find thoseepisodes and we're about to have a thirdone too uhi think november 30th there's gonna be athird home mining episode so if that'ssomething that interests you you shouldgo check those out uh starting with thefirst one uh because we literally spentlike three hours on all the differenttrade-offs thereyeah just to come back on on somethingthat you said about um generallyspeaking you're absolutely right thatyou're gonna pay uma little bit more for uh noko ac satsyou know especially if you go to thepeer-to-peer exchangesum but i just i like to try and reframeit and you know it's not a a no kycpremium and the theprice that you see on a kyc exchange ilike to call it the um the discount thatyou get given um for giving up yourpersonal information and puttingyourself uh a little bit more at riskthan versus uh getting some sats thatare not tied to your identity so i thinkthat's like that useful framing yeah thereal price is the private way and thenexactly discount if you sacrifice yourprivacyum and then one method that you didn'tmention which isprobably the most uh accessible to newcoinersis if you have a friend or a couplefriends that are interested in bitcoinand they've been in bitcoin for a whileum obviously if you can if you can paythem cash for some of their bitcoinum that is the most private uhi wouldn't say the most private but it'sdefinitely the most accessible privateway for a new coinerand if they if they don't want to sellyou any they might know someone whowants to sell some soum that's always something to keep inmind cashin person isextremely gives you very good privacyguarantees periodumwhat else also like if you knowto the to the bitcoiners out therelistening to this uh showum you know guide your new cornerfriends in throughthat kind of method right and whether ornot you want to actually explicitly sellit to them that's one thing butyou know if you if you go out to dinnerhave them pay for dinner with their withtheir cash or their credit card and thenpay them back in bitcoin orgive them you know birthday gifts inbitcoin and like get them started in apeer-to-peer fashion rather than justthrowing them to the wolves and sendingthem to a regulated exchangeyeah there's a couple of people in thechat that have just uh rightfullyshouted out um as techo vouchers as welland which is essentially uh you'll getsort of stores uh that sort of sign upto become an azteco um sort of vendorand you can go in hand over some cashand you'll get sort of a voucher whereyou can go and claim the the equivalentamount of sats from that again directlyinto a wallet that you controlthe the the other caveat the sorry theonly caveat with azteco is that thethe sort of uh kyc responsibility if anyis put onto the specific vendor so itwon't just be you know don't justpresume that because there's an articleum vendor near you that it won't be nokyc uh each one is sort ofuh left to kind ofcome up with the their owninterpretation of whether they need todo it or not basicallyand you have that major chain in you inthe uk that's an azteca vendor rightwhat's the name of thatit was poundland but then it stopped acouple of months ago and it's showing nosigns of coming back unfortunately uhokay so as they realized what was goingon they're like ah we can't too muchliabilitywhich was a shame because they they havea store in literally every town therewas hundreds of them and it was massivefor the uk but yeah unfortunate to knowmore okay well that's a shame um if youwant toread more aboutthe dangers of kyc you can go to bitcoinq a's website no kyc only dot comumhowever you decide to proceed withobtaining bitcoin and accumulatingbitcoinum the next step istrying to secure it uhsecure it well and secure it in a waythat you don't have to trust a thirdparty uh who can seize your fundsum so how shouldhow should bitcoiners how should newcoiners go about that bitcoin q awhat are their optionsthe natural uh first step for mostpeople unfortunately like we've justsaid is is um a centralized exchangeagain like coinbase cash app or someonesomething like thatwhere you will go on deposit dollars oryour local currency they will uh sort ofcredit your account with you know theequivalent amount of statswhat you have there is um an iouwhere you've got an account with themwhere they say that you've got this muchbitcoin essentially what you actuallyhave in real terms is uh well it's aniou and you don't actually hold anybitcointhe the sort of uh very essence ofbitcoin is the uh that you know thatgoes to say you're not your keys notyour coins which is banded around a hellof a lot and for good reason and itessentially means that if you're notholding the keys for your bitcoin uh youdon't actually have any bitcoinso you bought someone in exchange um thethe next step would be to get yourselfum a mobile walletwhere you can uh generate the keys uhwithin that wallet um so that your youand only you are in control of uh any ofthe bitcoin that you send to that walletum so before we before we move on andi'm sorry that i keep cutting you off ii hope i hope it's uh fine with youbefore you move on umso so the risk is if you're holding itif you're holding it in one of thesecustodial wallets which is what theexchanges default toum and there's some other services thatalso are custodial walletsumbasically the telltale sign of that isthe way you access it is through ausername and passwordumyou don't have any backup yourself whathappens there is there's a highlikelihood that your account could getfrozen we've seen that with paypal inthe past with fiat with just us dollarswhere paypal will freeze your accountand you're not able to get your moneyum it could be stolen if the exchangegets compromised or the custodial walletgets compromisedum and obviously you're trusting yourprivacy completely with the custodianbecause they know all of yourtransactions and your current balancesso it's not idealum and you want to learn how to holdbitcoin yourself becauseone of the revolutionary things aboutbitcoin is that you can hold it yourselfin a way thatumsomeone has to physically compromise youuh to to take your bitcoinum soi guess you're about to start withmobile wallets i think mobile walletsare the most accessible way getting awallet on your phone basicallyum to hold your bitcoin for you rightyeah just before i get down to themobile wallet it comes back to the pointi made earlier about censorshipresistant or being able to make thepayments thatum you know you want to make not thatthey give you permission to to make umif you've got to uh ask for permissionfrom an exchange to be able to sendbitcoin to your desired destination umyou know you're asking for permissionand you know that's not why we're herewe want to be able to spend our money towhoever we want whenever we want sofirst step and the easiest step is toget a phone wallet you know they're freethey're easy to access you know you candownload from any popular app store orquite a lot of them offer umdirect downloads so that you canuh download from the the you know thechosen teams umwebsite or or github umthe a lot of people tend to rush in andtry and buy um you know the next besthardware wallet straight away whenthey've just bought sort of 100 ofbitcoin to dip their toes in a littlebitwell if you you know if you're justdipping your toes in to see if thisthing's uh working for you then itdoesn't make any sense to you know goout and buy a hardware wallet and thisis coming for somebody who works for ahardware wallet company um it doesn'tmake any sense to go out rush out andbuy acouple hundred dollars on a hardwarewallet when you own less than that inbitcoin so that's why you already have aperfectly good phone that you carryaround with you it's very easy to spendand receive fromum but the important thing here is thatyou use a reputable mobile walletthere's a lot of scammy mobile walletsdon't just open up the app store andsearch for bitcoin wallet you will get alot of bad options thereyeah the the unfortunately the the top10 um results for that sort of search inmost of the app stores are quite abysmalmy personal recommendations would besamurai wallet if you're an android useruh or blue wallet or if you're an iosuser uh moon wallet is also another onethat i know you're pretty bullish onthat as well yeah both blue wallet andmoon wallet that's with 2us m-u-u-n areavailable on both android and iosumthey'rethey're very easy to use for beginnersuh i i would say they're not veryintimidating umso don't be intimidated you shoulddownload one just try itso the the kind of general premise ofthese and unfortunately i mentioned moonwallet there it's gonna umit's gonna book the trend of what i'mabout to say but the general premise isyou'll download the app from your chosenlocation uh the the app when you set upa new wallet the app will show you alist of 12 or 24 words which is yourmaster secret um you know which is thethe master backup to your to yourbitcoin wallet anybody that gets theirhands on that and be that physically ordigitally um is going to be able to takeall of your fundsso make sure that you write that downand secure it somewhere um safe andthenso moon wallet has a different backupmethod um it'll prompt you and explainhow to back up that butwe will focus on this standard which issomething we call seed words which isthey're basically these wordsit's a phraseand the wallet generates it for you andyou need to keep them secret youabsolutely need to keep them secret soyou don't want to put them on aninternet connected device you put themon you don't want to like save them inyour icloud notes folder you don't wantto take a screenshot and upload it toicloud what you want to do is at thebare minimum you want to write it downon a piece of paper double check thatyou wrote it down correctly store itsomewhere securely because if someonegets access to it they have access toyour funds but as long as you have thosewordsyour phone you could drop your phone inthe toilet it could fall you know itcould fall and crack and break or justcompletely justyou know some phones just like stopworking sometimesas long as you have those seed words youcan reinstall the app on a new deviceand just put in those words put in thatphrase words and you will have access toyour fundsyeah and the beauty of that is like yousaid most of the you know 99 of thewallets umin the space all sort of work to thatsame standard so you know you wouldn'tnecessarily have to even uhdownload the exact same mobile wallet aslong as the mobile wallet that youchoose umit abides by the rules which again mostof them do then you can sort of put thatseed phrase into into any other walletand there's a quick question in the chatwhich i think is probably good to touchon before we move on to hardware walletsandsomebody asked how much would you needto own to get a hardware walletnow obviously i'm not going to be ableto answer that for the for everybodythat that's watching you know it's quitean individual questionand all i would say is you knowif it's yourthe only mobile wallet you've gottenit's on your daily phone i would use theequivalent of how much cash would youphysical cash would you carry aroundwith you um you know what's your limitat which it's gonna start um affectingyour life if you used to lose thatbalance umthe quick review the mobile wallet themobile wallet should be like almostconsideredis is like your spending wallet what youwould have right inin in your back pocket but uhgoing further when we go into moremethods of storing your bitcoin thatwould be more like a savings accountum except i you're about to say a caveatuh i mean i have my own caveat i wouldsayi thinkespecially if you're using a reputableonei think people can feel a little bitmore comfortable than the kind of amountof cash they would carry in their pocketum i know like i wouldn't feel morecomfortable i wouldn't feel thatcomfortable carrying more than like 400in my pocketum but like a mobile wallet especiallyif it's your first wallet you're justgetting started you're gettingcomfortable you have your seed wordsbacked upuh your phone's up to dateyou know we don't seehacks are theoretically possibleobviously phones get compromised all thetimeumbut i i would probably if i had to picka number i'd like being like the 5 000to 10 000 rangelike that's where you start having toreallyconsider securing it moreum and you should also operate under theassumption because bitcoin tends togo up fastumyou should be prepared ahead of timebecause it could beyou know it could be a thousand dollarsin there and then in six months it couldbe worth eight thousand dollarsyeah the the other thing i would say aswell is that thisalmost everybody has got a spare phonelying around at the house that you knowyou could use that as your sort ofdedicated bitcoin phone and where youcouldbe slightly more comfortable storing youknow maybe larger amountsrelative to the individual and and thenyou could kind of decant off into yoursort of daily phone what you might wantto spend on a day-to-day basisabsolutely nothing wrong with thatapproach as well if you didn't want toand shell out quickly for for umfor a hardware wallet which we can wecan come on to now and so hardwarewallet is well before we get to hardwarewallets you also havethere's also software wallets on on thecomputer that you can haveright so you have mobile wallets youhave software wallets on your computerwhere it's like you install an app onyour computerumi i mean i would saylike unless you're an advanced user andyou have like a dedicated computer andthis episode isn't for advanced usersthey should probably shy away from thatin the beginning i i think the mobilesecurity model is a stronger securitymodel as you know as long as you're notworried about like the nsa or somethingum or like the chinese intelligenceservicesor these intelligence services um mostmost of the population uh are not greatat securing their their computer uh mostpeople's computers are unless you'resort ofa bit of a hacker man there's this youknow a far more vulnerable device thanyour mobile phone iswhich is why like you said you know icompletely agree that i don't recommendthem especially for larger amounts umand i tend to sort of skip straight tothe hardware wallet after the mobilewallet stageumsohardware wallets um are essentially adedicated uh physical deviceum designed to manage the the keys thatcontrol your bitcoin um so with thembeing a a physical dedicated device youknow their one purpose is to secure yourbitcoin whereas your phone hasyou know it's essentially a computer inyour pocket and with all of that extrafunctionality that your phone hascompared to a hardware walletincreases the theoretical attack vectorswhere hackers orthe nsa whoever can umsort of try and attempt to get theirhands on your bitcoin so these devicesare very focused andthey're focused at securing your bitcoinfrom physical attack um and also uh fromum digital attack ie uh you knowsomebody stealing your keys um over theinternet if you were to connect one ofthese devices to your uhvery likely highly insecure computerumso they a lot of them most of the goodones um work uh you know that theirprimary umway of of sort of keeping things secureis that they operate with what's knownas an air gap where they they canoperate without being connectedphysically to to any other device andbecauseit's that physical umconnection that sometimes can introduceuh uh intro um extrathreat factors so the the idea just todistill it here like the idea of ahardware wallet is that you have aa device that's builtto securely hold your bitcoin welltechnically it's holding the keys toyour bitcoinum butfor all intents and purposes it's it'syou can think of it as holding yourbitcoin and and it interacts with eitheryour computer or your phone in a waythat those keysall the keys are what protect yourbitcoin gives you access to bitcoin andyou don't want someone else to haveaccess to those keys it keeps those keysoff that computer or off that phone soit stays on the deviceand that device is never connected tothe internet sothethe basic concept behind securingyour stash with a hardware wallet isthatuh for someone to compromise you theyneed to physically have access to youand the device orif they can compromise the device justthe device but they like have to comeinto your home or come into your officeand get that device rather than hackingyou through the internetright and you know the even um if ageneric attacker was togain physical access to to most of thesedevices and they're still going to um afair bit of time and a hell of a lot ofequipment to be able to um you knowcrack theum protections on the device to be abletoaccess the keys um and to be able tosteal your bitcoin so it's not just acase of umprotecting you from a malware infestedcomputer um if somebody was to break inthere's still pin protection on thedevice and so it's not just a case ifyou lose the device um and you loseaccess to your bitcoin again the thepremise that matt spoke about beforeabout writing down your seed words um isexactly the same with a hardware walletuh the differences here is that um thethe when you sort of uh generate thosethose 24 or 12 words and it's done in anoffline environment that's never beenconnected to the internet so that againit just removes that extra threat vectorwhere um you're not connected to anysort ofinternet connected devices so it's justthat extra layer or wrapper of securityperfectumshould wewhat is your favorite hardware walleti saw that one coming a mile offum so full disclosure um i work for a umhardware wallet manufacturer calledfoundation devicesand obvious biases aside i genuinelybelieve that we make the umthe best option for a beginner enteringthe space umit's incredibly secure but also veryeasy to operate uh so i should havenamed the devices called passport andand another great device is the callcard umwhich is probably looks a little bitscarier to the newcomer i would say umbut has some extra features um thatmight bemore beneficial for more advanced usersthat they could sort of leverage sothose would be my two favorites yeah iwould say my favorite is uh cold cardumi've used multiple versions of coldcards i highly recommend them umand then ifwe're not really going to go intocoins here but if youabsolutely need to gamble onother coins in the space rather thanjust bitcoin uh both foundation and coldcard are bitcoin onlyumi mean so i i would say either use aledger or a treasureuh hardware wallet if if you wantcoin support um but even in thatsituation you probably shouldgo with a bitcoin only hardware walletfor your bitcoin and then use the otherones for your coins and just likethe mobile wallets there are lots ofreally bad harder wallets out thereso don't just googlebest hardware wallet because a lot ofinfluencers are paidtopromote them so you'll see youtubevideos with 500 000 views saying to usea horrible hardware wallet soconsider thatyeah what i would say just to back thatup again is that you know likelihood isif you're listening to this that you'reat least aware um ofyou know bitcoin twitter and the peoplethat are umaround and popular on there and most ofthose people have been around for a goodnumber of years and they've probablytried all of these devices so look towhat most most of theirmost of those people are using or atleast recommended and when you're sortof doing your own research to see whichdevice is going to be best for youperfectumwhen they're using their hardware walletthey need to use it with awith software they need to use it withan appso what are your recommendations forwhich apps they should use with theirhardware walletthe best two for meif you want to stay on desktop whichgenerally gives you sort of a little bitmore extra functionality would be numberone be spiral wallet um hands down myfavorite umor if you like a little bit of a sort ofeasier to to operate interface with kindof lessadvanced features spectre desktop isalso a great onetwo great recommendations spectre usedto be my favorite now sparrow's myfavoriteyeah um whichmight uh be a good segue for what we'vegot coming up next uh well before we getthereyou can also useyou can also use both the cold card andthe foundation passport with blue walleton mobile so if youare going through the steps and you gotcomfortable with blue wallet alreadyum because you started with a mobilewallet uh you can then use blue walletwith both of those hardware walletswhich is nice especially i mean i ithink some people listening to thisprobably don't have a computer that'sso a lot of people don't have computersthey just have the computer in theirpocketyeah you know we're heading towards amobile first world aren't we if not ifwe're not already there and blue walletdoesoffer a great interface uh especially uhwith with the with the passport with theqr interfaces uh very very slick andvery easy to wrap your head around as abeginnerawesome okay so you want to go to thenext topicyou said yeah let'slet's hit nodes yeah so i talked aboutum inspector desktop and one of thegreat features about like the desktop isit actually has a built-in bitcoin nodeso uh the next step along your journeyuh hopefully will be to look to run yourown bitcoin nodeum a bitcoin node is you can look at itas your umsort of interface into your into thebitcoin world and it's going to be thatnext step along the sovereignty journeyso that you can and again one of the thebuzz phrases that you hear in the spaceis verify your own transactionsand so when you receive uh any bitcointransactionand that will bebeing passed to you via a whole networkof nodesand the wallet that you choose to usewill be connected to a node now thatnode could be uma centralized node or operated by anexchange uh it could bea node that you don't know who existsthat might actually be a chainsurveillance company or hopefully itcould be your own node that you can runum in your house relatively cheaplynow the benefits of of running your ownnode like i said is you can verify yourown transactions so that you can be surewhen somebody's sending you atransaction and that the transactionabides bythe this sort of rule set umthat the the network that you've chosento join umthat we all agree on uh to put that alittle bit simplea little bit simpler is that you canbe sure that sort of nobody's trying tocheat you and send you some fake bitcoinor a transaction that's not valid and sothat you know you might be selling goodsor services and they might be paying youin bitcoin for thatandand if you weren't verifying your owntransactions they might be able to umsend you um the way i like to frame itis it's using your own note to interactwith the bitcoin network you have to usea node and if you don't use your ownnodeumyou don't have counterfeit detection isis like kind of how i like to view itsomeone can kind of trick youuh into it into thinking you havebitcoin when you don't have bitcoin soyou want to use your own node for thatpurpose and then second of all which ithink is almost more tangible to peoplebecause to be honest uh we haven't seenthat's more of a theoretical attack andwe haven't really seen it play out itcould still play out in the future youshould assume it it will so you want touse your own node for counterfeitdetection but second of all it alsoif you don't use your own node um you'retrusting your privacy with whoever'snode you're using so you want to useyour own node so that you don't have totrusta potential potentially a stranger or acompanywith that that private transactioninformation and balance informationyeah it's about removing trustessentially and and by running your ownnode you're you're putting the trust inthe hardware and or the the softwarethat you are choosing to run uh not theone that's kind of been given to you ifyou're operating with an exchange or acentralized node runner and so there'suma a massive awash of choice and withvarying degrees oftechnical abilitythe the easiest way to get running withyour own nodeis to download a piece of softwarecalled bitcoin corethis is kind of the the sort of uh defacto software built by the the bitcoincore developers uh that is essentially apiece of software that you can in acouple of clicks download onto yourlaptop or desktop and and it will startto download the your own copy of theblockchain so that you can umtransact with the built-in wallet andto just to get started and verify yourown transaction that way that'sabsolutely the easiest way and as itouched on earlier uh spectre desktopactually has umessentially that built in as well justpackaged in a slightly different way foryou and so they're they're absolutelyfree and within a couple of clicksyou'll be on the way to downloading yourown copy of the blockchain and havingyour own node set upthe problem with a setup like that isthat umyou i can't really um generally speakingconnect any mobile wallets to it so ifyou were to want to transact when you'reout and about and you run bitcoin coreon your laptopand you wanted to send the transactionthe likelihood is you're not gonna haveyour laptop with you so you you know youwon't be able to to spend as easily assome of the node options that we'regoing to come up come on to uh in asecond i'll just pause see if matt's gotanything to add thereumyeah so i mean if you're using bitcoincore or if you're using the built-inbitcoin core inspectoruh yeah correct your you can't the mainnegative is you can't use it with themobile wallet the also the othernegative isum your transaction and balance infowill be on your computer so if it'sa computer you use for work or acomputer you use uhto play games or look at porn orsomething like that your social mediahabitit might be easily compromised and thatbecomes a it becomes mostly it becomes aprivacy issueumbecause all your transaction historywill be there and all of your balancehistory will be thereum but also you can't use it with mobilewallets which is a key component as wellyeah so so the next best option um andunfortunately the most expensive optionis what's known as a plug and play nodeso this is where you'll buyessentially a small box from one of thevarious teamsto name a few we've got uh ronin dojowe've got raspi blitz we've got startnine uh umbrell there's loads ofdifferent companies or my nodeno nothere's loads popping up um all withdifferent feature sets but essentiallythey sell your boxuh that you plug in at home you plug itinto your router you plug it into thepower outletand then within a couple of clicksyou're off and running again to to getyour own copy of the blockchain and haveyour no your own node up and runningand before we move on uh civil dispatchuhcivil dispatch 26i had all the major node teams on for aconversation ontheir node projects so if you'reinterested in having one of thesepurpose-built boxes or you a lot ofthose projects that were just namedallow you to actually buy the hardwareseparatelyand then install their software on it umconsider listening to that sill dispatchright so and the the kind of finaloption is the diy approach like matt'sjust touched on where all of theprojects that we just said and we'llhave a parts list you can go away andbuyspend a couple hundred dollars buying ahard drive and a single board computerand a couple of other cablesand build your own node and put your ownsoftware well put the software thatthese teams provideand onto that hardware uh the the endresult is that you get um the same nodewith all the same features um obviouslythe caveat is that you've got to gothrough the process of buying thehardware yourself flashing the softwareand onto a micro sd card uh which mightcause you some you know if you're a lesstechnical user and you're lesscomfortable with taking that approachand that's why the teams offer theplug-and-play note it does sound moreintimidating than it actually isand i would absolutelyso like i encourage new users to gettheir feet wet um also juston thejust to go back a little bit aboutbitcoin core i mean if you're using youcan use you can also use bitcoin core ifyou're running bitcoin core on the samecomputer you're running spectre on or asparrow they both can connect to itumif you do that process you really shouldbe using it on a dedicated computer iknow i like kind of touched on thatearlier when i said you know if you'reusing it for playing games or socialmediait could get compromised easier becauseyou're using it for all these othergeneral purposes you're downloadingsoftware on it that maybe you haven'tverified you definitely haven't verifiedand have no idea what's really runningthereum so if you are going to go thatapproachyou should have a dedicated device youshould consider a dedicated computer adedicated phone that you are using withit um and uhyeah in general dedicated devices areare going to be more secure and moreprivate you'rewhen we when we talk about security andbitcoin land whereyou don't don't let perfect be the enemyof good don't get overwhelmed becauseyour setup's not perfect but at the sametime you're just trying toreduce your threats so that you're notthe lowest hanging fruit most of thetime when we see these hacks it'stargeted at the people that are mostvulnerableyeah and the just to go back to the diyapproach that was outlining umall of these uh different projects thatwe've spoken about have got reallyreally good documentation and quitevibrant communities as well uh ontwitter telegram or their own dedicatedforum and so don't be afraid to you knowgo and have a browser the documentationlike matt said it's not actually asscary as i made it sound um and also youknow go and ask some questions in the inthe telegram chat or in the slack orwhatever you know um chat room that thethe the project has gotum you'll probably find or you'lldefinitely find thatall of these the people that are inthese communities are really welcomingand they've definitely been in yourposition before now and and you knowthey they found uh the thought of thisreally scary a couple of years ago andyou know now they might be runningseveral diy notes so they'll be don't beoff-put by it100um i will echo that sentiment i wouldjust add a slight caveat that there arescammers in these telegram groups andthese chat rooms um they will often tryand impersonateuhpeople that are involved with theproject or other notable figures to tryand get you feel comfortable never nevergive anybody uh your seed words thosesecret backup boards never give themtheir secret backup boardsand you know always be skeptical ifsomeone in one of those groups tries todm you separately and tries to go into aprivate chat you know sometimes it islegit but you need to be extra cautiousin that type of situationyeah and and if somebody does don't beafraid to ask in in the sort of mainroom you know tag the person who youthink might have dmd you and said isthat his issue at the mme exactly butalways uh just act on the the on air onthe side of caution and and keep thatsort of adversarial mindset to think youknow why is this person reaching out tome completely out of the blue after ijust asked my first question enteringthe room100um so all those node projectssupport something called electrum serverand electrum server is a standardumit's it's a standard way to interactwith your own node um you can use thoseelectrum server details and then you canput them into sparrowyou can put them into many of the mobilewallets that we mentioned earlier youcan put them into blue walletwith samurai specificallythey don't use electrum server they usesomething calleddojoand with that pairing is as simple asthere's a qr code and you just scan theqr code with your samurai wallet on yourphone and it'll pair up with your nodeyeah the good thing is with dojo as wellis it's uh implemented in the vastmajority of the the note packages nowthere's there's more that have dojo thatthen don't which is really great to seeindeedshould we hit on the coin joinokay soi i just want you know we're we're anhour inum if you're a newcomer you just listento this hour and you're intimidated as uh don't be intimidated you knowstart with step one where we talkedabout acquiring your bitcoinumthen you know learn how to hold your ownkeys and slowly move through the processdon't you know freak yourself out thatyou know now now i gotta run a node toolike i'm now i'm really intimidated youknow step by step get your feet wet getcomfortable send transactions receivetransactions back up your wallet restoreyour wallet just get comfortable with itget used to it don't it's not somethingto be scared of it's something that youlearn by doingyeah i uh i put a tweet a couple ofweeks ago actually that kind of echoesthat that you know if uh sending atransaction uh makes you feel a littlebit uneasy then you haven't sent enoughtransactions um you can see on screenthere that the mempool is uh you knowit's a little bit busy than what it wasbut a couple of sats per bite is goingto get your transaction confirmed veryquickly and that's going to cost you youknow less than a dollar to send atransaction so we don't have we don'thave that on the list but before we moveon to coin join on chain privacyutxo management we should probablyhow does how does a newcomer choose whatfee to pay they open up their walletthey go to send a transactionumwhat like how do bitcoin transactionfees work i feel like that is somethingwe tend to gloss overyeah we overlooked that one um wellfortunately most of the the good mobilewallets especially the ones that we'veuh mentioned uh on tonight's stream uhwill give you a couple of options uhwhere you canum you'll they'll either have you knowthree options sort of low prioritymedium priority and high priority likeagain like we can see on screen or theremight be a slider where you can manuallyadjust the feeand essentially the the higher that thefee you pay the more likely that uh yourtransaction is going to be uh confirmedor processed quickeruh againa caveat with that one we've got a lotof caveats tonight is that umthe uh some of the estimation the feeestimations umthese wallets all use different sort ofalgorithms as to how they um calculateor estimate the fee that would berequired to get you confirmed in thedisplayed priorityso matt's got on screen here a reallygreatwebsite called mempool.spaceum which can it shows you again the thepriority uh fee selections uh or what itwould adviseand based on uh correct me from wronggame map but based on what's currentlyin the mempool um as well as sort ofhistorical data as well so it's kind ofaalways a really good sort of accuratelook at you know if you want to get yourtransaction processed within the nextblock uh right now it would take anestimate of 13 sats per byte um butagain there's a little caveat here thatthere's still umtransactions with much lower transactionfees umthan 13 sats per byte that will also getget confirmed so it's kind of umit's not an exact science uh i will saythatbut multiple sources is always a goodone if you want to try and uhget it sort of nailed so i mean bitcoinis a run by a companybitcoin is adistributed networkum and so as a result how bitcointransactions workiswe have this chain of transactionsand the transactions are within blockswe call them blocksumroughly every 10 minutes there'll be anew bitcoin block and it will havefinalized transactions included in thatblockuntil you get into a blockyou sit in a waiting list that waitinglistis we call that the mempool we call itamenpool technically every node hastheir own mempoolumbut if your internet connection is solidin most situations those mempools shouldall look the same so when you go tomempool.space you're looking at theirmempool that will look very similar toif you looked at the same thing on yourown node which a lot of these nodeprojects by the way allow you to runmempool.space natively with your ownnodesothebasically you have this like free marketthat's constantly going on where you'redecide wherepeople are choosing which fee they'rewilling to spend and miners are going tousuallyinclude you in a block based on yourorder in that waiting list based on howmuch you want to spendso if it's a transaction between someoneyou trust um and you're willing to waita longer period of time you can pay alower fee if you're sending just toyourself you can pay the lowest fee wecall that's one sap per byte is thelowest fee because you're just sendingit to yourselfum you know if if in some crazysituation where a one sapper by nevergets confirmed ever which we've neverbeen through you can always resend thattransactionso you're gonna want touh choose your transaction fee based onthe urgency you want that transactionfinalized on the networkand most good wallets will basicallygive you a low medium and highyou knowthislow being i can wait medium being likei'm in the middle ground because it'smedium and high being i don't want towait i want it finalized as soon aspossibleyeah andit'sit's a very much a dynamic thing it'slike a queue that's always evolvingevery single second because there's moreand more transactions being sent youknow every second andumit's not within you know outside therealms of possibility thatwhat the fee that you put up right thissecondmight not be enough to get youimmediately uh processed into the nextblock in sort of five minutes timeum so it's it's very very dynamic andyou know that's why i said it's not sortof an exact science so generallyspeaking for most people the walletestimators are pretty good especially ifit's an urgent transaction that you needto be processedimmediately100 i'm glad we covered that topicum also uhjust uh before we move on to the nexttopic just to jump backwith hardware wallets uhyou know the backup to that hardwarewallet are those words you wrote downumyou have the option of putting them intosteel these steel plates are availablemany different vendors offer the steelplatesand the idea there is if you put it intosteel obviously it's going to be waterresistant and fire resistant it's goingto be more sturdy than paperyou might also consider makingduplicates of those seed words andhaving them in different places so likeif your office burns down or your houseburns down it's still in the otherlocationwith the caveat that it meansit could be more likely that someoneelse finds it because it's in morelocations so you need to think aboutthat very carefullyand then third of all with hardwarewallets which i forgot to mentionone thing i like to tell new coinersis it's a good idea to have to buy twoof whatever you decide to buybecause if you have a second oneyou canyou can have the same backup wordsinitialized on both devicesso then if something happens to yourdevice not only do you have the seedwords available those those secretbackup words available to restore yourdevice you also have the second devicethat still has access to your funds soyou're not in a panic situationum so i always i tend to recommend topeople that they should buy two of thesame device whichever they choose umso that they they can have twoinitialize and you can keep those inseparate locations as wellif you wantokay yeah i think that's good adviceso when you're opening up a bitcoinwallet it shows a balanceum a common misconception isthatthat you know you just it shows yourbitcoin balance that's what's in yourwallet but in reality what's in yourwallet is basically a bunch of differentbitcoin transactions that all add up tothat balanceum we call those utxos uhthose those are unspent transactionoutputs utxos is what we call them youcan think of them like bills in yourwallet like maybe your wallet you knowyour cash wallet has50 in it but in reality it has two 20sand a 10and that's how bitcoin wallets work soyou have all these small utxos in therethat add up to your balance and that hasprivacy implicationsbecause ififtwo of those utxos come togetherum in a single transaction they'reobviously linked on this chainuh forever right we call it theblockchain it's this ledger oftransactions they'll be linked togetherbecause they were both spent in the sametransactionso that brings us to this idea of utxomanagementand coin control the idea oftrying tomanage thosebitcoin transactions in a privacy andcost effective way should you want to gointo that a little bityeah definitely um and quick i willstart with the two wallets that we keepmentioning blue wallet and samurai umoffer all the features that i'm justabout to cover that sort of help when itwhen it comes to to utxo managementandinspectoryeah sorry yeah i keep referring tomobile wallets but yeah the all of thedesktop uh the good desktop wallets thatwe've spoken about i've all got utxomanagement features as well um sothere's a couple of facets to it thefirst one is the ability to uh label thethe utxos or the pieces of bitcoin thatyou've got in your wallet so what wouldbe an example of a label might be thatif matt was to pay me for dinner uh orpay me back for dinner um when ireceived that transaction into my walleti could put a label on that to say thatthat's come from martin it was fordinnerum i could then receive my wages from myemployerumand i could put the the relevant labelon that just to know that where theorigin uhof that utxo is fromumso the once i've labeled themwhen i'm making future transactionsand i'mthere's two ways you can make atransaction you can let the wallet toconstruct it for you automatically whichthey might choose any random utxos andmerge them together again like matt saidto which will show common ownership thatmight not be a problem however if you uhwant to preserve your privacy and imight not want my employer to know thati'm friends with matt because he's a badperson um because i've labeled those i'mnot a bad person thoughbecause i play radical[Music]because i've labeled those utxos when ireceived them at the time um in you knowtwo weeks down the line when i'm goingto make a transaction um i can then chyou know consider and the person thati'm paying you know do i want them toknow that i know matt or do i want themto know that i work for the company thatpaid me uh with this utxo i can makethat informed decision then to say wellactually i'm just going to spend fromone of those pieces of bitcoin oractually it's not a bad thing matt's notreally a bad person i'm gonna combinethe two uh because the value that i wantto send i need to combine the twoum so those are the two two sort of mainfacets to it and and but obviously youcan't ummake a an informed decision when youcome to spend um if you don't know theorigins of all of the etxos that you'vegot and so they kind of go hand in handreally um you need to label so that whenyou come to spend you can make theinformed decision as to whether youshould merge or not yeah so a key aspectof bitcoin isif someone sends you bitcointhey can see where that bitcoin goes inthe futureand if you receive bitcoin you can seewhere that bitcoin came from in the pastsothis is why labeling is importantbecause you want to knowwhere that transaction came fromor it goes tobecausethat's who you're exposing your privacyto in that situationis that a good yeah installation yeahwhich you know um might not be a problemfor you know the person that i'm payingmight not um be able toor be clever enough to to use blockchainanalysis um but the other sort of umadversary that we need to consider hereis chain analysis firms that might betrying to umcluster or monitor your unchain activitywho you're spending to who you'regetting change back from uh to monitoryour habits to try and um piece togetherumyou know the identity because theblockchain doesn't have any identitiesat that at the blockchain layer um butthese companies work to kind oftie all the pieces together so that theycan um de-anonymize people and so it'snot just a case of umyou know hiding how much you earn fromyour friend uh it's also you know thesemore sophisticated actors that have gotmore a lot more resources to throw atthis and that you've also got to bear inmind as well unfortunately yeah you bothyou both don't want you don't want youremployer to knowwhat you're spending things onand you don't want the guy who sells youa sandwich to know how much money youmakebut on top of that we also have theseprofessional surveillance mercenariesthat work for governments dictators andcompaniesand they are just out there constantlytrying to track bitcoin transactions soyou also have that as a concernwhich leads us nicely onto coinjoin ithink if unless there's anything elseyou want to touch on no let's yep we cantalk about coinjoin now so coinjoin umis um acoordinated or collaborative transactionwhereyou and at least one other personwillcollaborate to construct the transactionthat casts some doubtas to theorigin and the output of the transactionto umto make suream thatstill could you still hear mei can still hear you yes oh sorry ithought i dropped out yes it's acoinjoin is a collaborative transactionwhere umthe the idea is that theuh somebody watching the blockchainagain chain surveillance firm youremployer your friend whoever they can'tumdeterministically orwith good probability be able to trackthepeople on the input side of thetransaction to the output side of thetransactionso it effectively attempts to put upsort of um a brick wall in your you knowthe the utxos history so that umanybody looking on chain can't be sure100umyou know is there one person involved inthis transaction is there 10 peopleinvolved in this transaction it justcasts doubt on the the uh path that thebitcoin has taken and and who sort of umyou know has the bitcoin change handshasn't it we we're not really sure so sotracking bitcoin is a probability gameumthese surveillance companies and theirtools will basically or just someonewho's curious and trying to spy on youum will basically assign a probabilityto every transaction if ownership haschanged because one of the things aboutbitcoin isyou know i could send bitcoin to myselfor i could send it to bitcoin q a anduh the chain doesn't delineate betweenthat so a key aspect of tracking bitcointransactions isumdetermining some kind of probabilitythat bitcoin actually changed hands andthen from there trying to seewhich hands it went from from who to whoum so coinjoin is this idea of acollaborative transaction and you canthink of it likeumjust for an example if you have fivepeople that are doing a coin jointtogetherinstead of uh having a simple path thatyou're following on chain and decidingif ownership has changed um all of asudden there's five different potentialpaths it could go downyou don't know which of the five peoplethat participatedwhich of their five outputs are themso it breaks that probability chainand it's a useful tool in terms oftrying torecr to have forward privacy have thisidea of someone who sent you bitcoindoesn't necessarily know which path yourbitcoin took going forwardyeah and specifically with umimplementations of coinjoin likewhirlpool which are known as equaloutput coin joints um the the the sortof notion is that everybody um on theoutput side all of the utx on the outputside of the transactionlook absolutely identical and soit's kind of uh i always like to use theanalogy of v for vendetta where you'vegot the million mask marchit's essentially the same thing but onthe blockchain where all of these utxosare indistinguishable from one anotherand so like matt said you've got someforward privacyand be quickand soi the the three major coin jointprojects our samurai whirlpool joinedmarket in wasabiumcitadel dispatch 15 was with the wasabiteam civil dispatch 16was with the join market teamand civil dispatchi don't know where he is i also did asamurai oneum is citadel dispatchit's there in your feed somewhere youknow uhstefan can just rattle them off he knowsexactly which one is which always amazesme that umi don't know which one it is i'll comeback to it and tell you but it's there'sthere's another dispatch with thesamurai team so if you're interested inthis uh consider going back andlistening to those threeumme and bitcoin q auh like samurai whirlpool the best youcan also you you don't have to usesamurai walla with it you can usesparrow wallet with it as wellumyeah yeah co-sign that samurai orsparrow a hands-down win is for me umespecially from a from a beginner'sperspective um definitely the easiestones to get started with in my opinionyou can continue on i'm trying to figureout which dispatchi'lli'll cover off one quick question that'sum quite on topic and somebody askedwhat's the difference betweenum coinjoin that we've just spoken abouton a coin tumbler so the unfortunatelythe words uh or the the meanings havebeen kind of umwhitewashed somewhat over the years butum generally speaking a coin tumbler isa centralized service where you willhave tosend inyour bitcoin and give up a custody of itto whoever's running the tumbler andthey will send you somebody else'sbitcoin backand i absolutely wouldn't recommendanybody use thesebecause you're putting yourselfum completely in the hands of whoever'srunning the tumbler and that you knowwhether they're going to send you yourbitcoin back or notand yeah soand you also not only you're trustingthem with your bitcoin if you use acustodial mixer it's the same ideas ascustodyum because custodial risks with walletsum you're also you're trusting them withyour privacy and your fundsum so the key aspect of coinjoin is isthe idea that you are reducing trust inany kind of centralized third party umwasabi and samurai have a centralizedserver that they doum[Music]that they use to coordinate the coinjoins to make them easier better uxuh and more reliablethose coordinators are blindedwith samurai specifically you can use itwithout your own node and then you'retrusting samurai's node so that goesback to our earlier conversation aboutusing your own node you should use yourown node when you use samuraiotherwise you are trusting them withyour transaction and balance informationas as is the case with all light walletsum i found it so so it's still dispatch15 is wasabi still dispatch 16 is joinedmarket and still dispatch 30 is samuraiso consider listening to thoseokay i think are we done on coinjsshould we move on to the next topic um ihave multisig as the next topic butshould we do lightning real quick firstsure thing yeah yeah i think it's apt umsoquick high level on what the thelightning network is uh it is a scalingsolution for bitcoin that umallows you toum transact with uhactual real bitcoin um but you don't doso with what's known as an on-chainfootprint and so it allows you to sortof lock up a small amount of well asmuch bitcoin as you want onto thissecond layer solution known as thelightning networkso that you can umyou essentially just defer the theoverall settlement um of any number oftransactions from going on chain to toreduce fees and also to allow you totransact um much quickerso whereas uh one on chain transactionyou know might cost you a couple hundredsats depending on the fees and you youmight be able to send you know 10or even 100lightning network um transactions forthe sameuh for the same amount of fees um nowthere is uhunfortunately lots of caveats with thelightning network again in terms ofbeing able to do it properly uh with uhthe best way to do so be with one of theuh no packages that we've spoken aboutbefore andwhich will dictate that you need tomanage your own sort ofyour own channels which is essentiallywhere you lock up this bitcoin to beable to to transact on this second layerumso it's a little bit more of a hurdle toto get on board with um but you you sortof can save yourself a fair bit on feesespecially if we ever see a feast bikeagain um which i think is inevitable umthe i don't knowinevitable um sofirst of all there's been a lot ofdispatches on lightning if you gothrough the feedconsider listening to those there's likea lot of different caveats and nuanceswhen using lightningspecifically with privacy i did a fullprivacy episode with openobs and anthonythat's still dispatch 21 that's onlightning privacyuh so consider checking that out but themain differentiation that you as a newuser should think about with lightningis going back to our transaction feeconversation earlierwhich iswhen you use a regular bitcointransactionyour transaction fee is not based on theamount you send it could be kind ofweird for youuh it's it's actually based on theamount of utxos that you useuh for the transaction it's based on thedata size not the amount of money thatis sentsoyou could end up sending a five dollartransaction with bitcoin on chain aregular bitcoin transaction and it couldcost the same as sendinga five million dollar transactionnow with lightningit's different the way fees arecalculated on lightning is based on theamount you're sending so that'll be morecomparable to something that you're usedto in traditional finance world where ifyou send more money you're going to paya higher fee you send less money you'regoing to pay a lower feenowuh moon wallet with 2us as we talkedabout earlier mobile wallet supportslightningand blue wallet supports lightning nowif you use blue wallet in its defaultstate with lightning it's going to be acustodial walletwhich i don't loveuh if you insist on using it use it witha small amount because they can takeyour funds you are trusting them withyour privacy um ifuhyou can also use blue wallet withsomething called lnd hub which some ofthese node projects offeri think umbral and my node offered idon't know who else offers it but if youuse it with lnd hub or your friend's lndhub then it's not custodial with bluewallet it's custodial with who's everrunning the lnd hub so if you run thelnd hub yourselfthen it's not custodialotherother lightning specific wallets onmobilethat you can use so moon does bothblue wallet does boththen there's lightning specific mobilewallets that are very good uh there'sphoenixwallet uh there's breeze walletumbreeze b-r-e-e-zcontinuing the bitcoin naming scheme ofusing words and spelling themdifferently um is there anotherlightning wallet that i'm missinglightningeclair as well haven't youwell claire is phoenixphoenixyeah why do they have two okay but yeahboth of those are good yeah one allowsyou to manage your own channels and theother one does it for youokay phoenix does it for youyepokay so forget eclair your new corneryou have phoenix and you have breezewallet or you can use moon or bluewallet and that'srather than for savings you should thinkof that more asokay this is like my spending wallet mytransaction fees are based on the amounti send i'm going to be sending smalleramounts umso i i might use lightning rightyeah i agree i'm quite a big fan ofphoenix um especially from a perspectiveof you know one that a wallet thatmanages the channels for you and i mightget a lot of for this in the chatbut i'm i'm a firm believer that mostnew users don't shouldn't strive todive head first into lightning withtheir own channels because it's it'sit's not easy it's not approachable andeverything that we've already discussedum in terms of holding your own keys umuh using coinjoin and and not using kycare far more important than uh strivingto get your own channels up and runningum quickly uh i don't know what youthink about that matt and i'm waitingfor the in the chat no i mean ithink i i i think umlightning on mobile uh with the walletswe just mentioned moon blueum breeze phoenixfor smaller spending amountsuh is very accessibleuh actuallyif you if you actually want to dolightning in a proper sovereign wayum that i would say is a more advancedthing don't get intimidated by it but ii think it's important for ourall-encompassinggetting started guide that we do mentionit it exists and what are the you knowdifferent trade-offs basically thetrade-off there is a little bit you'regetting less security uh you're gettingless reliability with lightning umbut you're getting lower feesfaster transactions all else equalum[Music]and it could be very useful in a mobilespending type of situationyeah i agreephoenix and brees really great ways toto get started with lightning that havesort of their own unique um trade-offsuh that kind of give the the best ofboth worlds from it from a new userperspectivewhen you compare them with umcustodial solutions like the defaultblue wallet or running your own channelsand that's one of theyeah i mean that's one of the reasonswhy i like moon so much like moon with2us has like different tradeoffsum it doesn't have a standardized backupprocessuh it's you know if if you'rea lot of big corners will say it's youknow not a lightning wallet but at theend of the dayit's not a lightning wallet because youstore all your funds on chain you're notstoring it in a proper lightning walletum but what's cool about moon isif you scan a qr code it could be alightning qr code or it could be aregular bitcoin qr code and it justautomaticallyfigures that out for youum and and vice versa yeah so so you canjust have you can have some spendingcash in your moon wall at muunand whatever whatever bitcoin qr codeyou scan it will send but it doesn'thave power user features it doesn't havethat coin selection that we were talkingabout with utxo management it doesn'thave labelingit doesn't have a standard backupprocessso these are all things to keep in mindright multisig multisig let's let's gohere's where we get into the weeds alittle bit um right so you've been inthe weeds for a whileall of the uh wallets that we've spokenabout umthe desktop wallets mobile wallets alloperate umon what we colloquially call a singlesig setup where they have um a singlesecret or backup um which is requiredwhen you want to spend your bitcoin amulti-sig wallet is where you combinetwo or more of theseseparate wallets together to create abrand new walletwhen you set up this multisig wallet youcan dictatethe minimumamount of keys required to be able tomake ato sign or authorize a send transactionso that could betwo from a possible three keys is apopular one all the way up to somethingelaborate like 11 or 15 you know whichmight be uh used in sort of a businesssetting props um but two of three whereyou need two signers from a possiblethree that were created to that we useto create the wallet to sign off on anytransactions from that wallet so whywould you want to do that wellwith a single sig wallet and some of thethree theoretical attack vectors ifsomeone's to someone but somebody was tosteal your deviceand and umwhile you know if they snatch your phonewhile it's out of your hand and you'vegot your wallet unlocked um they cansteal your bitcoin if that was one ofthe keys in a multi-sig wallet where youneeded two to spend from then they can'tsteal anything from youumanother one of the attacks that multisigprotect from is known as a retirementattack where there might be a malicioushardware wallet vendor thatdoesn't publish their source code um andthey umhave some uhmalware baked into into the the into thedevice and that is actually uh has theability to stealyour bitcoin i will say again correct meif i'm wrong game out but that has neverhappened again it's a theoretical attackbut if you were to use um a multi-sigsetup where you've got differenthardware wallet manufacturers if one ofthose is is maliciousum they can't get access to your fundsbecause they don't have you know if it'sjust one key out of two that arerequired they don't have the uhthe minimum number of keys required tosteal anythingall the goodall the good wallets all the goodhardware wallets are open source sotheoretically open source meansthat the code is available for you toverifyum and you can read the code line byline nowif you're a new coiner you're probablyup to this point you're already reallyintimidated you're like matt i can'tread codei'm aware okaysoat the end of the dayit is very good that you're able totechnically verify the code but mostpeople will be updating their hardwarewallets and they will not be verifyingthe code so there is some trust that youare you're trusting that hardware walletmanufacturer to not ship uh maliciouscode to you and you're also trustingthemuh that that the actual device wasn'tcompromised when it was first sent toyou right so with multisig the idea isyou can have multiple but specificallyin a hardware wallet ida hardware wallet multisig the idea isyou can have multiple vendorsuh that aremultiple different hardware wallets thatcome together to form your walletandyou needa combination of them as bitcoin q a wassaying a common one is two of three youneed two of them to spend the fundsthis reduces trust in any specifichardware wallet manufactureryou also have the added benefituh that those backup words instead ofthose backup words being aumone and done situation if someone findsthose secret backup words we call themseed words if someone finds those wordsthey have access to your funds in amulti-sig setup you haveummultiple sets of backup words and theyhave to find the required threshold ofbackup wordsin order to spend your funds so ifyou're using a two of three you're gonnahave three sets of backup words you'regonna have three hardware walletsthose backup boards obviously can be onsteel as we said earlierum and you can have them in differentlocations so bitcoin gives you bitcoinwith multisig gives you this uniquesituationwhere you can have a geographicallydistributeduh security setup where you're holdingyour own coinbutthethe the keys to access it can be locatedin different places they can beduplicated you can keep copies of themin different places and for someone toactually compromise you and take yourfunds they're gonna need to have accessto a combination secretwe lost bitcoin q a about two minutesago or a minute and a half ago and i'mjust gonna keep talking until hereconnectssothat is the main benefit of multisig[Music]do not once again do not get intimidatedhereuhplenty of people store bitcoin in singlesig uh setups it is thenormal way of setting it upum this is something you might graduatetouh multisig ux multisigumi guess ux can be kind of a complicatedwordlike the way you interface with themultisig walletis a relativelynew thing in bitcoinumso it it has a little bit more of alearning curve it is a little bit morerough around the edgessoyou want to get really comfortable withit as i said earlier you want to bebacking up restoring spending receivinggetting comfortable with it separatelyof your single sig setupnow one cool aspect of multisigis that you canactually have a single sig walletuh so you can be using a hardware walletthat is single sig and then you cantake that single sig and you canactually also use it in a multi-sigenvironmentandit can be one signer of for instance thetwo of three in the multi-sig but alsoit could also be its separate walletum andi guess the main advantage thereumi guess there's two main advantagesthere first of all if someone findsyour single sigback up your your secret words uh itmight have some small amount of funds onit and they think that's all your fundsthey they can't tell that it's in amulti-sig setupumso they might just take that funds andthink they took all your bitcoin umthis thesecondary benefit isthat you know you can repurpose thesethese hardware wallets and use them formultiple wallets now one other caveathere is with multi-sig you do want toback up additional information besidesjust your seed wordsumbitcoin q a came in and then left againso i will continueumthe popular multi-sig softwaresparrowspectre supports it blue wallet supportsitthey will tell you what you need to backup and make sure you save all thatinformation now that informationthat additional information that's notyour seed words umthey will have terms like derivationpathum descriptorthe list of something called x pubs youdon't necessarily have to know what allof that means you just have to save itand you just have to realize thatwhileseed words area security risk if someone gets yourseed wordsthat information that separateinformation that you have to back upwith a multi-stick wallet is a privacyrisk so if someone finds that they cansee how much you're holding in themultisig but they can't necessarilyspend itbut you need that information plus yourbackup boards in order touh to spend your funds bitcoin q are youbacki am apologies for that that'll happen ithink it's my networkno worries at all um i just continued onand i just kept talking about multisigdo you be holding it downumii get i mean i think we arei i think i sufficiently explainedmultisig tradeoffs and and benefitsumshould we move on to mistakes commonmistakesyeah did you cover sort of thealternatives to doing it yourself themultitec approach no i didn't that'sgreat why don't you go into thatyeah so obviously matt's just outlinedsome of the potential pitfalls withdoing it yourself umso one of the other options is known askind of collaborative custodyalternatives where um there will be acentralized service uhsome examples are on chain capital anduh casaumwhere they will help you coordinate amultisit quorum and where they hold oneof the keysand so that in the event that you wereto umso i'll give you an example you'd have akey on your mobile phoneyou'd have a key on a hardware walletand one of theseservices will hold the key as wellso they only have one key so they can'tsteal from you which is greatumbut if you were to lose say your phonewhat their key or the key on yourhardware while and he didn't have itbacked up they will be able to step inas a third party to help you move yourbitcoin so that in a doomsday scenarioand you um you don't lose your lifesavings which is really greatyou will pay for this service and againi'm not sure on how much each charge thebottom tier i think is just over 100umlast time i checked per year and one ofthe the trade-offs with this is that umunless you sign up uh without yourpersonal information which i believe isquite difficult to do umthethese uh centralized um entities thathold the key and part of yourmulti-sitcorum they know who you arethey know how much bitcoin you hold inthat wallet because they hold one of thekeys and they alsohold the sort of uhthe wallet file if you like to put itsimply and so that they canjust as a kyc exchange can umbe able to tie you to your bitcoinidentity so it's worth paying up thetrade-offs yeah and you're using theirnode sothe assumption is if you do this if youuse one of these providersuh you're trusting them with yourprivacy but they will hold your hand andthey will have a spare key for you aswellum and they will help you onboard intothe process they will help you gethardware wallets they will go throughthat whole process but you are trustingthem with your privacy they know yourtransactions they know your balancesandin 99 of situations they know who youare as well uh they'll know the ipaddress of your of your devices that youconnect fromthis is all kind of getting a little bittoo much into the weeds but the key isthat you're trusting them with yourprivacyum i was explaining earlier justbasically doing it yourself so you coulduse your own note and you aren'ttrusting someone in that situation youcan still haveumother people hold keys for you so abitcoin q a started with a two of threesetup because that's a very common setupbut another common setup is a three offive setup and if you do a three of fivesetup you have five total keys and youneed three to spendsoif you need three to spendyou can hold three keys yourself so thatyou know you have and you put them indifferent locations and you know youhave enough to spend it yourself butthen you can also have you know a familymember a frienda lawyerholdhold a key you can have differentcombinations of people hold the key soit can be very useful inum[Music]specifically in in situations whereyou're trying like inheritancesituations where if if you pass away youhave large bitcoin savings uh you knowmaybe a lawyer is holding one in a trustmaybe a couple family members areholding individual ones and theybasically all need to collaboratetogether in order to spend your funds ifyou have three keys with other peopleum but you can also do it in a way whereyou don'tyou don't they never have the thresholdthey need to compromise you pluscombined togetheryeah i think umjust one final thing before we move onto the next topic um inheritance is abig one for me that um i i sort of liketo drive over people who seem to seemkeen to kind of jump into the diyapproaches thatyou know you might have spent some timelistening to some podcasts watching someuh tutorials or reading some guides andfeel comfortable in setting up amultisigumsetup um but what happens if you're notaround tomorrow unexpectedly uh is yourspouse your next kin are they going tobe able to coordinate a spend from a twoor three or a three or five do they knowwhere to find the keys do they know howto recover it and if you answer no toany of those questions then uh all ofyour life savings disappears when youdisappear soand something to bear in mind especiallyif you're going to take the diy approach100 i'd also add that there's a middleground hereuh specifically supported by cold cardcalled seed xor and basically in thatsituation instead of having one seedit's not multisig but instead of havingone seed you have two seeds and you needboth of them in order to spend yourfundsso it's a little bit different thanmulti-sig it can be more accessible topeople uh because you don't have theseadditionalcomplications that we were justdiscussing with multi-sigbut it gives you that benefit of nothaving a single seedbackup wordsthat can be compromised by someonethere's also something that's supportedby pretty much every wallet out therecalled a passphraseand in that situation you have thesebackup boards are usually 12 wordphrases or 24 word phrases thepassphrase is the 13th word or the 25thword and you pick that yourselfso if you do that method then you cankeep the passphrase separate from yourbackup words if someone wants tocompromise you they need access to bothumand i mean if it's a weak passphrasethey might just take your backup boardsand keep trying pass raisesumbut it it adds an additional umburden on them to try and compromise youwithout going through a multi-sig setupum anotherinteresting thing about passphrases isyou can store money on the bear backupwords and then you cannot when you use apasswords it's a separate wallet soin that situation you can actually keepfunds on youryour basic backup boardsand then if someone finds that they'lljust steal those that money and theymight not know you have a passphrasewith the majority of your savings in itum so that's just something to keep inmindawesome do you want to cover off uh somesome common mistakesnext on the listyeah i think common mistakes is a goodspot to go nextuh so i've got quite a lengthy list hereandthe first one of which unfortunately iuhfell fell prey to a little bit um andthat is uh it comes back to our veryfirst pointof cape kycmultiple exchanges and without any realneed to really um so i've just uh sortof expose myself to you know put my nameon loads of different databasesand soit's an unfortunate one that you can'treally undo like we spoke about beforeand if you were to you know listen tothis podcast and decide that youumstill want to gofor a kyc exchange because you think youknow the task of going uh no care adviceandtry and limit your umyour exposure to this by just signing upwith one reputable exchange umi think that's a good one to start anddid youi think that's very good advice like ifyou are going to use a kyc service whereyou're providing your identityinformation you should choose itcarefully you should choose someone youtrust the mostand you shouldnot sign up for a lot of people justsign up for a ton of different servicesyou should only you should sign up forthe bare minimum ideally if you're gonnado it you sign up for oneyou use it solely just to buy bitcoinand then send it to your own walletsumand and you don't you don't use anyother additional kyc services you wantto limit that as much as possiblesecond thing is did you change your micsetup at all because it's way worse nowthan it was beforeuhhello i changed my computer um i'll havea player how much while you're talkingnow turn up is it just quietno we can hear you but it's just likebreaking up a little bit it's likecutting in and outall right i'll let i'll play aroundumanother common mistakeuhthat i see people make isi i mean gambling on coins so a lotof people will think that um bitcoin istoo expensive and i've missed the boatand i i'm too late to bitcoin umliterally every single person who hasentered bitcoin at any time in bitcoinhistory has thought they were too latethere's like a famous screenshot ofsomeone on one of the bitcoin forums uhlamenting that they didn't get in atfive cents and instead they got in at adollar and they were too late and theymissed the busum so everyone feels that wayuh you're not alone in that it'simportant to realize that you cantransact insmaller units of account we call themsatssoyou can you don't have to have a fullbitcoin you don't you don't you don'tneed like right now bitcoins at almost70 thousand dollars you don't need toput 70 000 and to use bitcoin uh satsare the smallest unit of bitcoin there'sa hundred million of themper bitcoin andright now sats you can get 1500 for adollar so you can send any amount ofsats you want to send you can send twodollars worth you can send 25 centsworthumit doesn't matter don't get caught up inin in thinking that bitcoin is tooexpensiveuhwhat common thing that these other coinswill dois they make it so they have so manyunitsthat it seems like it's cheaper than itis just to try and get you in the doorit's a it's a marketing tactic so justkeep that in mind uh q are you thereyeah how's my mic now oh so much betteri'm glad i brought it up perfect okay doyou have more common mistakesuh yeah common one um is just notpracticing umenough with transacting uh testing mybackups for my hardware walletstesting different wallets even usingtest net just practice practice practiceand getting comfortable uh using the thevarious tools that we've spoken aboutandgetting comfortable with it either usingtestnet which is basically uha copy a carbon copy of bitcoin that'shas that holds no value you can get itfor free onwebsites called faucets where you can goon and just mimic the normal behavior ofa walletand without the fear oflosing any real value and so you cansend some test net bitcoin to to your hardware wallet and youcan wipe it recover itand just to get really reallycomfortable with with that process sothatif um the worst was happening and yousomething was to happen to your houseuh where you say bitcoin wherever youstore your coin andyou're when you're in that packed stateit's not like the first time you touchyour hardware wallet for five yearsbecause you you know you've done thatyou know people call practice so you'vegot this lots of time if you send realvalue in there but it'sconnected to you and because you know ifyou're in a panic and you you need tomove your bitcoin quickly the last thingyou might be doing is doing itin unfamiliar uhsituation or in a familiarsituation wherebecause that's when mistakes happen andyou could uh muck something upyeah so we see that happen a lot whereyou know peopleuh so i actually don'tespecially for newcomers i don't know ifyou need to use testnetum it adds just anothercomplication to your processumbut but what happens a lot is likepeople will buy bitcoin they'll send itto a hardware wallet they never reallyuh get comfortable with itthen bitcoin goes up in valuesignificantly and like four years laterthey're trying to spend it and they'rejust not comfortable at allso you really want to get comfortablewith it you want to practice sendingreceiving backing up and restoring umand just you know i don't think testthat's necessary in that situationbecause you should just do it with thesmall amounts you knowuse you know send five dollars back andforthuh erase the wallet restore it from yourbackup see that your five dollars arestill thereum one nice thing about my earlierapproach that i mentioned if having twoof the same hardware walletis without putting funds at risk at allyou can load up one hardware wallet withsome bitcoinand then you can restore iton your second hardware wallet you canload up those secret words onto thathardware wallet and if your funds arethere and you can spend them then youknow you did the backup and restoreprocess correctly without actuallywiping the original wallet so that'sanotherbenefit you're basically verifying yourbackup and restore processyou don't want to be in a situationwhere you have a lot of moneyandyou have a lot of money on the line andyou've never done a backup you've neverhave you've never done a restoredprocess and you're just freaking out andmaybe you wrote down the words wrongi've had that happen to friends wherewe've had to guess the word that theythey wrote down wrong or wrote down inbad handwriting um so you don't youdon't want to be in that situation youwant to practice practice practicei think just to add to that uh backupprocess as well is thatmost of the umor the hardware wallets that we'vetalked about this evening havemultiple different types of backups aswell so i think it's worth noting thatpractice using both of them as well sowe've got the the siege words umboth call card and passport alsoofferingbackups as well where you can store itbackup onto a micro sd card um which is alittle bit easier to store and so iwould urge people to practice restoringfrom both methods as well becauseat the end of the day if again if in adoomsday scenario you don't know whichmethod of backup you're actually goingto have access to or which is survivedwhatever um you know doomsday scenariohas actually happened100um before we move on to more commonmistakes we have alex mccluskey in thechat asking about 401k ira fundsum if you're trying to hold bitcoin in aa in a in a tax beneficial way in yourretirement accounti would just keep this very simple uh ifyou do haveuh a 401k or an ira where you alreadyhave funds in it and you want to movethem into bitcoinjust consider using uh the serviceoffered by unchained capital that'sunchained.com disclosure they are asponsor of ofmy other show rabbit will recap thisshow does not have sponsorsumbut they're a sponsor becausethey're a good team it's a good productumi have friends there that are workingthere my buddy jeff andrew runs theirtheir retirement division and they willhold your handthey will help you through it obviouslyas we said earlier the caveat is you'retrusting them with your privacyum but pretty much in all situationswith retirement funds if you're using atax beneficial retirement uh methodyou're going to have to trust someonebecause it's all getting reported to thegovernment as wellthe nice thing about what unchained doesis you hold your own keys so you getthat tax benefit um but you're holdingyour own keys they can't spend yourfundsa lot of the other programs that are outthereumcan can spend your funds at will and youhave to trust them completely with thesecurity of your funds and your privacyso just something to keep in mindyeah the next one umfrom me is kind of a little bit moreoutside of the box umi lurked around on on bitcoin twitterand in some of the communities uh for alot longer than i really should have umwhen i started to uh interact with withpeople in the you knowwallet chat rooms or the no chat roomsand to use a few examplesmy knowledge grew exponentially fromthen onwards from having thoseinteractions versus me just sitting onthe sidelines and kind of you knowliking a few tweets every now and thenso if i was to go back and kind of havemy time again i i'd absolutely startgetting involved and start contributingand to the conversation much muchearlier because uh personally speakinganywaymy my knowledge just uh you knowskyrocketed compared to where i was justa couple of years ago and so big one forme that oneyeah that's uhand uh i just i think like learn bydoing right practice with small amountsumand get your feet wet rather than feelintimidated and feel like you have toread everything and listen to everythingand watch everything uhbefore you even get your feet wetyeah another one as well is and and mattmight roll his eyes at this one is iskind of going publicumthere there's a lot of value in instaying in the proverbial shadow so tospeak um i would urge people you knownot touh sort of start shouting from therooftops uh that they own bitcoin againbecause you know we talked earlier aboutkyc and how we kind ofcan paint a sort of red cross on yourback a little bit well shout from therooftops um when bitcoin hits anall-time high to all your friendsand might uh inadvertently do the samething one day um you know yeah 100 alittle bit jealous you never know he'sgoing to get jealous andtell somebody else you tell somebodyelse who'san individual that might want to try andget their hands on it soum i would be be candid about who youwho you speak to bitcoin about and it'sa bita double-edged sword that one because uhi think we've all got a little bit of apersonal responsibility to try and helpon on board others as well so um alsosay just kind of be selective about whoyou speak to it and what you sayyeah it is um it might sound a littlehypocritical coming for meum as aas as a as a public bitcoin figureumbutdefinitely in the beginning you shouldnotyou should you should not be talking youshould try and reduce how much you talkabout bitcoin don't make it obvious thatyou own bitcoin don't post on socialmediauh consider using a name like bitcoin qa does i mean it might surprise you buthe wasn't born with that namehe decided on that name himself for theinternet for his bitcoin workumin the future if you do want to becomemore public about ituhyou can do so in a moreresponsible wayum rather than doing it right in thebeginning you can never come back fromit once you do itum so it's something to keep in mindyou should never talk about your ownbitcoin you should never talk about yourown how much bitcoin you haveumthese are best practices uh you don'tyou don't uheven if it's a friend or a family memberit might seem like small amount todaybut in the futureuh it could be a large amount and theywill not forget it they tend to rememberone of the first questions mostfriends and family will ask you is howmuch bitcoin you own they love askingthat questiondo not answer it explain why you don'twant to answer it for themumif people do know you own bitcointhis is where that multi-sig setupreally shines because you can have itgeographically distributed you can haveyour keys in different locations um thatare far away from each other that makeyou getting compromised more difficulteven in a physical attack situation andobviously it is more ideal to live in aplace where you haveum proper gun rights and you can defendyourselfumso these are things to considerum if i was to do it againi probably would not be uh you know aspublic as i am about bitcoin um i made ajudgment calllater on in my bitcoin journey that ifelt we needed more public bitcoinfigures that were talking about realissues and specifically privacy um so imade that judgment call but there aresome mornings that i wake up and regretitumbut there are precautions you can takeand there are benefits though to beingsemi-public about your bitcoin usage uhmeeting people i've met some of the bestpeopleyou know i have i have basically i havefamily now that wouldn't exist otherwiseum but these are all things that youshould considerum as part of your bitcoin journey butin the beginningvery very very stronglywould sayyou know keep keep it as discreet aspossibleum you never knowyou knowyou you don't want to expose yourself toa malicious actor your government couldturn on bitcoina foreign government can use thatinformation against you uh if you'retraveling across a border or somethinglike thatso you you want to keep this in mindyeah the final um sign off one for me umwould beuhi just completely got out of my brainuh what is another two fa is another onea good one to touch on i think um yeswould be um if if you and it's just comeback into me now so i've got two tofinish off um if you again listen tothis podcast decide that no kosc is notfor you and you want to sign up for anexchange and a lot of these exchangeswill prompt you to use uh sms-basedtwo-factor authentication to um i'musing air quotes here to secure youraccountum this is where you'll get a textmessage to when you try and log into theto the exchange they'll send you a textmessage to authorize that login um therehave been multiple umuhinstances where this has beenexploited people have had theirinformation and their accounts hacked onthese exchangeswhich if youunfortunately have got funds on thataccountcan be withdrawn to whoever's got accessto your account they can withdraw it totheir own walletanda better alternative and would be to usean app-based uhtwo-factor authentication so an examplewould be umthere's one called anduh there's one called a edgiest uhthere's another one called um help meout here matt i've drawn a blank umuh did you say agesyeah i said aegis yep aegis is myfavoriteany app-based one and far more secureand there's been far f well aegis isopen source aegis is open source uhthat's a e g i s and the backup processis very easy you got to remember whenyou when you use these authenticatorapps umif your phone dies you want to make sureyou have a backup of themso yeah the most popular one is googleauthenticator and it's notlast i mean i haven't used it inmaybe six years or something like thatbut previously it wasn't easy to back upso make sure you're using one that iseasy to back upand back it up and keep multiple copiesyeah or the other alternative is you canget umlike a physical device that acts as yourthe second factor authentication lookslike a bit of a usb key that providesthe the additional authorizationbut less services tend to umoffer compatibility with those100umi i would say i think for most peoplethe physical device is overkillum can a sophisticated attackercompromise a phone base two factoruh yesum have we seen any widespread cases ofthat no do they still need your emailand your password yes umon that note you shouldn't be using thesame emails and the same passwords indifferent placesum if you go to haveibinpone.com you canput your email address in and it'll tellyou wheneveruh database gets leaked with your emailor your password or your personalinformation um so that's a veryimportant resource but but what we see alot of times is like there'll be like aleaklike maybe facebook will get hacked andthose emails and passwords will then beused at all the other services to tryand get into your accountum so that two-factor code gives you anadditional protection on top of that butyou really shouldbe trying to limit reuse of emailaddresses and never reuse passwords umyeahuh yeah there's one in the chat scoobysnacks asking is a password manager agood idea yes definitely would recommendit to anybody my personal favorite isis bit warden again another free andopen source uh software they do offer apaid version as well but the thefreemium uhoption is perf is perfectly good enoughfor for uh 99 of users i would sayyeah bit warden's great um you justgottaif you're using a password managerum there's some nuance there because ifyou're not self-hosting your passwordmanager you're using awhat's the main onelastpass people love lastpassumit's closed source you're kind ofputting all your eggs in one basketuhso there's some concern there you knowif you if you have all your passwords inthis password manager and that passwordmanager gets compromised then all ofyour accounts are compromisedumwhat i think is like a veryuh easy accessible thing forumnew users or people that are concernedis is your really important passwordsyou can just write them in a notebookyou write them in a notebooksomeone's going to need to get access tothat notebook physically in order tocompromise youumyou might not want to write it outcompletely clear you know maybe somethings you remember versus some thingsare on the paperyou can develop your own like kind ofcode system don't over complicate ityou'll probably forget the passwordum[Music]but uhpaper and pen paper and pen is a triedand true methodyeah absolutely and then just don't putit on athe final one that went out my headbefore um waswe've spoken about uh you know there's alot of information the past couple ofhours umdon't try and uh do everything in thespace of a week especially if you areliterally at step one um i would sort ofpick one of these topics you know wespoke about them in aumin a specific order for a reason and iwould urge people to sort of start fromstep one and try and master each stepbefore they move to the net before theymove on or at least not try to do toomany of them at the same timedepending on the approach depending onthe the approach that you take for thedifferent tools that we've we've spokenuh you know to do it properly and to doit justice and to understand it andpractice it like we've been like we'vebeen sort ofreiterating it's gonna take you you knowum a good bit of time you're gonna haveto dedicate some time to do this and tomaster some of these tools so trying todo too much too soon is setting yourselfup to to fail so take your time uh beum deliberate about it and and sort ofmaster something then move onyeah and our i that's great advice andas bitcoin q a said our order in thisepisode was intentionalso don't feel like you have to gothrough all the steps at once butgo throughthat order was how we we we chose thatorder specifically because we think it'sa very um[Music]efficient effectiveuh managing trade-offs and stuff balanceof what order you should kind of becoming into this um we also have someperson in the chatum who uses the nim some person so everytime i call him out in the chat i soundlike i'm just don't care about his nameuh asking for the best a two-factor appfor ios i really like authenticator plusfor ios users um i think it's availableon android as well but if you're onandroid i really just like aegisumso yeah there you go for that answerum i have on this list bitcoin q a ihave common questions do you have commonquestions that you have in mind orum i've got nothing noted down but kindof umoff the top of my headum a common one that i get is sort of uhis umis this setup good for me or is thiswallet the one i should useuhyou know insert service or or tool hereyou know is this goodum it's the thing with bitcoin and andusing the tools properly that we've beenspeaking about is thatwhat matter i might recommend from ourown personal experiencesmight not be perfectly applicable toyour own personal uh throat metal threatmodels or skill set um soagain we we have kind of covered thisground a little bit earlier but is umjust try things out um you know by i'mnot saying don't come to the people imatter myself and ask for advice youknow we're always um more than happy toto to help out um but the best thing todo is to sort ofget your hands dirty and try these toolsyou know you can do it for for free orfor a very low fees at the moment andjust testing out wallets or or differentdevicesor multi-sig setups if you want to gothat far coinjoin implementationsumbest thing to do is get your hands dirtyget get amongst the communities and youknow what's perfect for one person mightnot be perfect for another so umit's a bit of adyor do your own research and getcomfortable with what's going to workfor you really100 um just to reiterate umbitcoin q a has all of his guides atbitcoiner.guideumi have a list of resources and tools atcivildispatch.comhelpat the top of civildispatch.com help ihave also i have links toboth bitcoin q aummyselfand our buddy katan from australia whoruns ministry of nodes offers uhwe offer private one-on-ones and there'slinks to all of that at the top ofcivildispatch.comhelpum so if you dofeel that you you have the need for aone-on-one a specific time to jump on acallum that is available to you as well ihighly recommend both bitcoin q aand and katan uh for that and that's whythey are at the top of that pageumi thinkuh narwhal tacos has an interestingpoint i i kind of touched on it but ifelt like it was a little bit too earlyin the episode so i didn't go heavy intoitumhe's asking have you explained that noone actually holds their sats in a wallat just the key it took me a while towrap my head around thatthat is absolutely correctum you're not actually storing yourbitcoin you're storing the key thatallows you to access and spend yourbitcoin um so when we talk about allthese wallets when we talk abouthardware wallets and mobile wallets it'sreally uh either piece of software apiece of hardware that is that isstoring that secret key for you andallowing you to easily access that soyou can access your bitcoin um i thinkthat's an important point but i i do iwould say thatthat's almost more of ai don't know i i feel like it's more ofan advanced thingfor all intents and purposes you cankind of operate under the assumptionthat you're holding your bitcoin in thewallet butum it is a good it is a good point thankyou narwhal tacos um i think with allthat said it doesn't seem like we haveuh any any additional questions in thelive chat i would add that obviouslythis is still dispatch 43 there's been42 other episodes filled with contentum well that's a lot more advanced thanthis so if you want to dive into thatafter listening to this obviously feelfree to do that it's all available forfree without ads or sponsorsum q a you have any any additionalthoughts here before we wrap upi just want to reiterate just getamongst the communities use the toolsget your hands dirty don't be afraid totry things out um come to myself or mattfor any help and advice and just oneother you know we've mentioned katan umone of the prominent educator in thespaces uh btc sessions got a fantasticyoutube page that's got guy video guideson using literally everything to do withbitcoin so um if you're more of a visuallearner uh check out his youtube channelit's a fantastic resource as well 100that is also linked at civildispatch.comhelp or you can just search btc sessionson youtubeum i made him a channel on bitcointv.comi don't think he has uploaded anythingtherebut there's also a ton of great contentat bitcointv.com that is curated one ofthe issues and the pitfalls you shouldkeep in mind when you're on youtubeumespecially the high view count videosare filled withscams and bad advice um so you need tobe very careful uh you know if you'rewatching a btc sessions video it mightrecommend another video that looks likeit's reputable and that a lot of peoplehave watched and recommended ityou need to be very carefuluhat the end of the day bitcoin's aboutpersonal responsibilityumso no one's gonna be

bitcoin onapple pay here's what he saidit's something that we're looking atit's not something we have uhimmediate plans to douhfori would sort of characterize it as thereare things that i wouldn't dolike umuh our our cash balancei wouldn't go invest that in crypto uhnot because i wouldn't invest my ownmoney in crypto but because i don'tthink people buy an apple stockto get exposure to cryptoand so if they want to do that they canthey can uhuhyou know invest directly in crypto orthrough other meansuh and so i wouldn't do thatand i'm i'm not planning to in theimmediate future to take crypto for ourproductsas a as a mean of tender uh but thereare other things that we're definitelylooking at like whatuh like i wouldn't want tohave anything to announce todaywell let me ask you a different questionbecause you just said that you might notdo it personallydo you own crypto in any bitcoin orethereum would you play around with thisi i do yeah i think it's reasonable toown it as a as a part of a diversifiedportfolio and i'm not giving anybodyinvestment advice by the wayso[Music]happy bitcoin tuesday freaks it's yourboy matt o'dell here for anothercitadel dispatch the interactive liveshow

namemy opinion is odell it's very easy torememberum so with all that saiduh we got a repeat guest here bitcoin qa good friend um and our plan is to tryand do an episodeuh have a conversation herewhere it's all encompassing from startto finish new new bitcoin are cominginto the space trying to do things youknow the right way trying to do thingsin a secure wayumand and just have it all in a singleepisode have it all in a singleconversationso as i was saying earlier the writerdies that are in the live chat um if youhave questions put your questions in ifif you're not a beginner and you'relistening in and you think we missedsomethinguh feel free to put that in the livechat as well and just a reminder thelive chat is accessible through thetwitter twitch and youtube streams andthey all getfed into uh the main chat so with allthat said i'd like to introduce bitcoinq a how's it going bitcoin q ahey matt it's going good thank you forhaving me back on uh it's been a while ithink um episode number two was now withthat with ergo so uh yeah lookingforward to getting back to it and uhrunning through some some of thebeginner-focused uh stuff that seems tobe missing from some of the podcasts uhfloating around me to tend to get jumpinto the weeds pretty quickly sometimesdon't we yeah i mean i have a feeling weare going to also be jumping into theweeds but we're going to try and do itin a nice constructive path into theweedsyeah i need you to keep me uh keep me incheck on that onebut yeah you are a dispatch lg it hasbeen it's been a minute and uh we'vewe've both been through a loti like to see like to think that we'vebeen through it together and uh yeahjust uhlove that you're back joining us and youknow i hope it's you know not just thesecond time it'll be many more times inthe futureumso with all that said freaks uh we havea bit of a structure that we set up forthis episode which is unusual fordispatch but i think it'll keep usmore focused um and so we're going tostart withactuallygetting bitcoin for the first timeum so do you want to you want to startwith that bitcoin q ayeah so uh it's buying bitcoinsnever been easier than it is todaythere's uh exchanges popping up all overthe place every every man in this dogseems to beuh giving you the opportunity to to beable to buy bitcoin from within theirecosystem or their appumthe the kind of elephant in the roomunfortunately and uh is is the um knowyour customer or kyc is it's uh it'slovingly called within the spaceumkyc is a regulation that essentially anysort of businessentity that has a banking relationshiphas to abide by that kind of dictates umthat they must collect certain pieces ofinformation from anybody that they givea service to obviouslyin the context of bitcoin that's anexchange that sells you bitcoin fordollars pounds yen whatever yourjurisdiction isumso in practice that looks like if youlike go on the cash app and you try andsign up to cash app to buy bitcointhey require you to upload your id youraddressuh i'm not sure some some servicesrequire like a selfie um that's whatwe're talking about right here which isthis identification information that'srequired when you sign up to one ofthese regulated servicesright and some of these are some ofthese exchanges now are even doing uhvideos where you they take that like a3d scan of your face which is kind ofscary really andso with all that said why why is thatkind of um why is that sort of a badthing that that people like matt andmyself sort of try andumwarm people away from or at least paintthe dangers clearly for everybodyeverybody um so when you supply thisinformation to to be able to buy bitcoinin a you know a really sort of easy andstress free way you know cash apps agood example where you can just in acouple of clicks get some bitcoin into awallet that you controlbut one of the main problems is that youknow all of this information getsrounded up into a centralized databasethat's controlled bythe entity that you're doing businesswithum unfortunately these entities or someof these entities they won't toureverybody with the same brush um don'thave a great track record of uh securingit effectively umtalk about perfect timing we we heardabout um a hack with uh robin hoodyesterday was it it was seven millionusersseven million users uminformation has been leaked um nowthere's varying degrees of the severityof the leak some of it's just emailaddresses uh some of it's more personalinformation like banking details etcumyou know to name a few others equifaxfacebook t-mobile clubhouse linkedinuh coinbase ledger um all of thosecompanies umrequiresome form ofof your personal information to to dobusiness with them and and they've allhad hacks where again with varyingdegrees of severity that um somebodythat shouldn't have got their hands onyour information did so i'm you knowwhat we're not talking small fry heresome of these uh hacks were in to thetune of millions and millions of ofpeopleum now you know if that's something likefacebook and your uh email address getsleaked you know it's not really the endof the world it might piss you off alittle bitwhen you tie that into umsomething like bitcoin wherehopefully especially after you'velistened to this podcast and you're sortof securing your own wealth that mightbe uh in your house that might be in aloved one's house or a combination ofthoseif uh if if the wrong person was to gethold of this information you know yourselfie your home addressum indicate in the case of coinbase howmuch bitcoin you've actually boughtthat is umessentially painting a very large crosson your front door that ummight make it inviting to the wrong typeof people to come and pay you a visit tosee if they can relieve you of of thosesatsso that's one of the main umyou knowuh reasons that that i personally tryand sort of make people aware that yesgoing on to cash app or coinbase orwhatever is is you know they make itreally really simple they've got reallynice polished uis to to be able to goand umget some get your hands on some statswithin it within a couple of clicks umit'syou know one of the big big risks isthat this information is leaked on aregular basis and there are companies inspace that to their credit and haveyou know they've nev never umbeen fallen prey to one of these attacksand but unfortunately they do seem to becoming um more and more uh frequent umso yeahthat's one of the main risks with kyc soyeah i mean i would add a couple thingshere uh first of all even if you know acompany hasn't been compromised yet weshould basically operate under theassumption that they will be compromisedin the futureumthis information once it is taken isoften soldto other people as wellit can be combined with otherinformation that was leaked from otherdatabases so for instanceumif you know you you have the facebookleak and the facebook leak has yourmailing address in it and then you havethe ledger leak and your ledger leak hasyour email address in it but thefacebook link also had your emailaddress in it they can combine those twouh leaks to get your full email addressand your actual in-person addresssecond of all we've seen umwe've seen physical attacks happen topeople who were known bitcoiners and howmuch bitcoin they had uh sometimes itwas because of these leaks it's hard totell for sure sometimes it's becausepeople just talk about their bitcoin andhow much bitcoin they own which you alsoshouldn't doumthird of alluhthis information can obviously be usedagainst you by your own government itcan also be used against you by foreigngovernments in the future obviously itis painting a target as you are someonewho owns bitcoin and uses bitcoin andexactly how much bitcoin you haveuh and then fourth of all in thecoinbase league specificallyumall of your withdrawal history was alsoleaked so uh it can be used to trackyour future bitcoin transactions uhbased on that information and we will gofurther in onon bitcoin privacy and trade-offs ofbitcoin when using bitcoin trying to useit privately how to go about that inlater on in this episode but these arejust things to keep in mindright so you know all of which is issort of incredibly scary um and theother thing final thing odds aboutbefore we sort of look onto thealternatives is that you know umsomething that i like to sort of keep inmind and remind people is you knowbeing here for number go up is great youknow i'm not going to sit here and saythat um i don't like to see us hitall-time highs all the time um butbitcoin is also umcreated to be able to make thetransactions that they don't want you tomakenowif you're sort of uh tying all of yourbitcoin to your personal identity umyou're you're kind of putting a inyour armor before you've even startedthat you know if you do want to makethose purchases that umbitcoin allows you to make um due to itspseudonymity thenyou're sort of starting two steps backby tying your your bitcoin holdings toyour personal identity um which is wheresort of buying from a new kyc source itcomes in so that you can have umsome or hopefully you know in a perfectsituation all of the bitcoin that youownso before we get there before we getthere just one more thingkycthese records are forever once once youdo these records you have to assumethey're foreverum is it best practice to delete anaccountum i you know if you're no longer usingit yes but you should assume that actualdatabase record hasn't been deleted umand it might be used against you in thefuture um so these are things to keep inmind umnow let's move to okay so if you'retrying to avoid kyc you don't want touse one of these regulated services whatare your optionsright so the the sort of uh two mostcommon ones that kind of get bannedaround in terms of actually purchasingbitcoin um is bisque uh which is apeer-to-peer uh decentralized exchangewhere you essentially it's a maker takermodel where somebody will want to umsell some bitcoin and they will go on tobisque and they'll say you know i wantto sell uh x amount of bitcoin for thismuch um you know 500 whatever and andthen you as a buyer can go on to thatsort of uh peer-to-peer marketplace andand look for these offers to see onethat sort of fits your bill that youknow was is within your price range andyou know the amount that you want to buyyou can go on completely and honestanonymously and and sort of take theirtheir sell offer so that you can buythat amount of bitcoin from themumthis isbisqyep so it's an application that you justdownload onto your computer basicallyyou run it all locally uh you knowthere's no personal information youdon't need to show any id's to sign upthe only person again depending on thepayment method that you use you knowthere's many many payment methods umsome are better from a privacyperspective than others and but let'ssay you knowmost people are going to go on and andif they want to sort of be able to takea wider range of offers from you knowmore people across the world they'regoing to want to use the banking systemwhich you know might ring some alarmbells to some other people listening butumwhat also i say is what's worse issharing your banking information withone person who is very likely to wantvery likely to be a privacy preservingindividual because they you know theyprobably wouldn't be using bisqueotherwise versus uh the regulatedentities that throw all of yourinformation into a centralized honey potthat we've just explainedum so that's one way you know some ofthe more private options that areavailable on bisc umare sort of postal money orders whichyou know i don't really know great dealabout um because it's a u.s centricthing um but you've also got cash in themailand then there's various various otheroptions that are kind of uh relevant totheir sort of jurisdictionsumanother option as well is huddle huddlewhich worksquite similarly to the way i've justdescribed with bisc and the thedifference being is a huddle huddle iskind of a centralized company um thathosts uh the sort of buy and sell uhlocations for you you know it's awebsite huddlehuddle.comum where you can go and sort of makeoffers or you can take offers again inthe same fashion umso so there may be some uh other alarmbells are in game where thinking whereum well what happens if i go on tobiscor to huddle hollow um and i youknow take this buy offer and i sendsomebody some some you know us dollarsand what's to stop them from just neversending me the bitcoin so both of theseservices um work on what's called anescrow system where the seller will haveto deposit the bitcoin first into amulti-sig wallet that is controlled byum by the buyer the seller and the sortof centralized entity um so thatbasically they theyuh can't sort of run off uh once they'veyou know got hold of your dollarsbecause they have to deposit the bitcoinfirst and and you'll be notified to waituntil you send any of the payments sothat they've proved that they've sort ofdepositedthe bitcoin into that um there is stillsome risk there but it's a reduced riskyeah absolutely you knowit's kind of i would say it's more of agrief and attack than ayou're not really at risk of losingfunds it's more of a um going throughthe arbitration process to prove thatyou've sent the dollars so that you getthe bitcoin back in the end so it'sgonna be more of a headache more than arisk to to actually lose any uhany cash would you sayyeah more or less umsoyeahcontinue so some of the other options umif youuh you can buy from bitcoin atmsthere's a really great website calledcoinatm radar.comwhere you can go on and punch punchingyour physical location i would recommenddoing sousing a vpnand and it will tell you all of thebitcoin etms thatare in your local area the the generalpremise of these is that you uh walk upyou can deposit some cashuh give it a um bitcoin address uhhopefully from a wallet that you controlwhich we're going to come on to laterand the bitcoin will be depositeddirectly into that wallet that youcontroluh there are again as is always the casewith bitcoins from caveats um justbecause you're depositing cash doesn'timmediately make bitcoin atm superprivate depending on the umthe brand of atm machine that you usesome of them do still ask for id um butthat is uh distinguished on the websitei've just said which is callingatmradar.comright some ask for id and thenand then some ask for just a phonenumber some ask for bothyeah which and obviously the the onesthat just ask for the phone number arethe better ones because you can spoofthat with services like textverified.comwhere you can just get kind of a burnernumber uh to satisfy the atm's umuh you know phone number requirementsbut obviously that's not tied to to yourpersonal identityum and then before we continue before wecontinue since we're still like early inthe episode and i should have mentionedin the beginning uh bitcoin q a has uhmy favorite guides in the space so ifyou want to look up somethingspecifically or if you prefer readingum if you go to bitcoiner.guidehe has all of his guides listed there sojust keep that in mind okay continueyeah pretty much everything that we'retalking about i've got some uhsome form of information on it um soyeah moving on to other noko i seeopportunities um so we've covered uhpeer-to-peer peer-to-peer exchangeswe've covered atms and the the next sortof option is to uh is to earn it umwhich might sound a bit outlandish tosome people are new and entering thespace but also we'll say is thatumeverybody has some form of a uniqueskill um and there's always going to besomebody who needs umwhat you can offer them uh it's justabout sort of uh trying to build up abit of a reputation whether that's inyour local area or online and so thatyou canyou knowsell your time or your skills andknowledge um and receive satsin in in repayment for themand the other option again probably notas much of a beginner optionas i would like it to be but the otheroption is to mine itumalthough home mining does seem to begoing through somewhat of a renaissancewhich is really really great to see andso the the general premise of that isthat you canbuy a bitcoin miner you can plug thatinto your um outlet at home plug in anethernet port connect up to to a miningpool and stream yourself somesecret sats or some private no kyc satsuh directly again into your wallet thatyou control umthere's been you know a fair bit of foodbanded around that home mining is iskind oftoo difficult or it's too expensive umthe the thing i would say is that yeahit's very much dependent on yourelectricity prices um but again you knowthis this shows fairly us centric andthere's a lot of places in the u.s whereyou know and if you'reum earning anywhere less than i thinkyou knownails in the chat they'll probablycorrect me on this but i think you'reprofitable mine at the moment anywherebelow 30 sats 30 shots yeah so i meanwith with all of these techniques youmight be spending a little bit moremoney than you would beum if you went through one of theseregulated services um you'rethe way i justify it is i mean you'reyou're paying a little bit of a premiumfor privacyand you're paying that for privacy goingforward too so it keeps paying dividendsuh with mining specifically mining homemining is a fantastic wayuh in my opinion ofaccumulating kyc free setsumit's really nice because once you haveit plugged in it's just constantly goingyou don't even have to really thinkabout it just constantly bringing inmore sets um we already have two wholemining umcivil dispatches so if you go back ifyou go to civildispatch.comor if you go through the podcast feed orif you go to bitcointv.com and ourplaylist over there you can find thoseepisodes and we're about to have a thirdone too uhi think november 30th there's gonna be athird home mining episode so if that'ssomething that interests you you shouldgo check those out uh starting with thefirst one uh because we literally spentlike three hours on all the differenttrade-offs thereyeah just to come back on on somethingthat you said about um generallyspeaking you're absolutely right thatyou're gonna pay uma little bit more for uh noko ac satsyou know especially if you go to thepeer-to-peer exchangesum but i just i like to try and reframeit and you know it's not a a no kycpremium and the theprice that you see on a kyc exchange ilike to call it the um the discount thatyou get given um for giving up yourpersonal information and puttingyourself uh a little bit more at riskthan versus uh getting some sats thatare not tied to your identity so i thinkthat's like that useful framing yeah thereal price is the private way and thenexactly discount if you sacrifice yourprivacyum and then one method that you didn'tmention which isprobably the most uh accessible to newcoinersis if you have a friend or a couplefriends that are interested in bitcoinand they've been in bitcoin for a whileum obviously if you can if you can paythem cash for some of their bitcoinum that is the most private uhi wouldn't say the most private but it'sdefinitely the most accessible privateway for a new coinerand if they if they don't want to sellyou any they might know someone whowants to sell some soum that's always something to keep inmind cashin person isextremely gives you very good privacyguarantees periodumwhat else also like if you knowto the to the bitcoiners out therelistening to this uh showum you know guide your new cornerfriends in throughthat kind of method right and whether ornot you want to actually explicitly sellit to them that's one thing butyou know if you if you go out to dinnerhave them pay for dinner with their withtheir cash or their credit card and thenpay them back in bitcoin orgive them you know birthday gifts inbitcoin and like get them started in apeer-to-peer fashion rather than justthrowing them to the wolves and sendingthem to a regulated exchangeyeah there's a couple of people in thechat that have just uh rightfullyshouted out um as techo vouchers as welland which is essentially uh you'll getsort of stores uh that sort of sign upto become an azteco um sort of vendorand you can go in hand over some cashand you'll get sort of a voucher whereyou can go and claim the the equivalentamount of sats from that again directlyinto a wallet that you controlthe the the other caveat the sorry theonly caveat with azteco is that thethe sort of uh kyc responsibility if anyis put onto the specific vendor so itwon't just be you know don't justpresume that because there's an articleum vendor near you that it won't be nokyc uh each one is sort ofuh left to kind ofcome up with the their owninterpretation of whether they need todo it or not basicallyand you have that major chain in you inthe uk that's an azteca vendor rightwhat's the name of thatit was poundland but then it stopped acouple of months ago and it's showing nosigns of coming back unfortunately uhokay so as they realized what was goingon they're like ah we can't too muchliabilitywhich was a shame because they they havea store in literally every town therewas hundreds of them and it was massivefor the uk but yeah unfortunate to knowmore okay well that's a shame um if youwant toread more aboutthe dangers of kyc you can go to bitcoinq a's website no kyc only dot comumhowever you decide to proceed withobtaining bitcoin and accumulatingbitcoinum the next step istrying to secure it uhsecure it well and secure it in a waythat you don't have to trust a thirdparty uh who can seize your fundsum so how shouldhow should bitcoiners how should newcoiners go about that bitcoin q awhat are their optionsthe natural uh first step for mostpeople unfortunately like we've justsaid is is um a centralized exchangeagain like coinbase cash app or someonesomething like thatwhere you will go on deposit dollars oryour local currency they will uh sort ofcredit your account with you know theequivalent amount of statswhat you have there is um an iouwhere you've got an account with themwhere they say that you've got this muchbitcoin essentially what you actuallyhave in real terms is uh well it's aniou and you don't actually hold anybitcointhe the sort of uh very essence ofbitcoin is the uh that you know thatgoes to say you're not your keys notyour coins which is banded around a hellof a lot and for good reason and itessentially means that if you're notholding the keys for your bitcoin uh youdon't actually have any bitcoinso you bought someone in exchange um thethe next step would be to get yourselfum a mobile walletwhere you can uh generate the keys uhwithin that wallet um so that your youand only you are in control of uh any ofthe bitcoin that you send to that walletum so before we before we move on andi'm sorry that i keep cutting you off ii hope i hope it's uh fine with youbefore you move on umso so the risk is if you're holding itif you're holding it in one of thesecustodial wallets which is what theexchanges default toum and there's some other services thatalso are custodial walletsumbasically the telltale sign of that isthe way you access it is through ausername and passwordumyou don't have any backup yourself whathappens there is there's a highlikelihood that your account could getfrozen we've seen that with paypal inthe past with fiat with just us dollarswhere paypal will freeze your accountand you're not able to get your moneyum it could be stolen if the exchangegets compromised or the custodial walletgets compromisedum and obviously you're trusting yourprivacy completely with the custodianbecause they know all of yourtransactions and your current balancesso it's not idealum and you want to learn how to holdbitcoin yourself becauseone of the revolutionary things aboutbitcoin is that you can hold it yourselfin a way thatumsomeone has to physically compromise youuh to to take your bitcoinum soi guess you're about to start withmobile wallets i think mobile walletsare the most accessible way getting awallet on your phone basicallyum to hold your bitcoin for you rightyeah just before i get down to themobile wallet it comes back to the pointi made earlier about censorshipresistant or being able to make thepayments thatum you know you want to make not thatthey give you permission to to make umif you've got to uh ask for permissionfrom an exchange to be able to sendbitcoin to your desired destination umyou know you're asking for permissionand you know that's not why we're herewe want to be able to spend our money towhoever we want whenever we want sofirst step and the easiest step is toget a phone wallet you know they're freethey're easy to access you know you candownload from any popular app store orquite a lot of them offer umdirect downloads so that you canuh download from the the you know thechosen teams umwebsite or or github umthe a lot of people tend to rush in andtry and buy um you know the next besthardware wallet straight away whenthey've just bought sort of 100 ofbitcoin to dip their toes in a littlebitwell if you you know if you're justdipping your toes in to see if thisthing's uh working for you then itdoesn't make any sense to you know goout and buy a hardware wallet and thisis coming for somebody who works for ahardware wallet company um it doesn'tmake any sense to go out rush out andbuy acouple hundred dollars on a hardwarewallet when you own less than that inbitcoin so that's why you already have aperfectly good phone that you carryaround with you it's very easy to spendand receive fromum but the important thing here is thatyou use a reputable mobile walletthere's a lot of scammy mobile walletsdon't just open up the app store andsearch for bitcoin wallet you will get alot of bad options thereyeah the the unfortunately the the top10 um results for that sort of search inmost of the app stores are quite abysmalmy personal recommendations would besamurai wallet if you're an android useruh or blue wallet or if you're an iosuser uh moon wallet is also another onethat i know you're pretty bullish onthat as well yeah both blue wallet andmoon wallet that's with 2us m-u-u-n areavailable on both android and iosumthey'rethey're very easy to use for beginnersuh i i would say they're not veryintimidating umso don't be intimidated you shoulddownload one just try itso the the kind of general premise ofthese and unfortunately i mentioned moonwallet there it's gonna umit's gonna book the trend of what i'mabout to say but the general premise isyou'll download the app from your chosenlocation uh the the app when you set upa new wallet the app will show you alist of 12 or 24 words which is yourmaster secret um you know which is thethe master backup to your to yourbitcoin wallet anybody that gets theirhands on that and be that physically ordigitally um is going to be able to takeall of your fundsso make sure that you write that downand secure it somewhere um safe andthenso moon wallet has a different backupmethod um it'll prompt you and explainhow to back up that butwe will focus on this standard which issomething we call seed words which isthey're basically these wordsit's a phraseand the wallet generates it for you andyou need to keep them secret youabsolutely need to keep them secret soyou don't want to put them on aninternet connected device you put themon you don't want to like save them inyour icloud notes folder you don't wantto take a screenshot and upload it toicloud what you want to do is at thebare minimum you want to write it downon a piece of paper double check thatyou wrote it down correctly store itsomewhere securely because if someonegets access to it they have access toyour funds but as long as you have thosewordsyour phone you could drop your phone inthe toilet it could fall you know itcould fall and crack and break or justcompletely justyou know some phones just like stopworking sometimesas long as you have those seed words youcan reinstall the app on a new deviceand just put in those words put in thatphrase words and you will have access toyour fundsyeah and the beauty of that is like yousaid most of the you know 99 of thewallets umin the space all sort of work to thatsame standard so you know you wouldn'tnecessarily have to even uhdownload the exact same mobile wallet aslong as the mobile wallet that youchoose umit abides by the rules which again mostof them do then you can sort of put thatseed phrase into into any other walletand there's a quick question in the chatwhich i think is probably good to touchon before we move on to hardware walletsandsomebody asked how much would you needto own to get a hardware walletnow obviously i'm not going to be ableto answer that for the for everybodythat that's watching you know it's quitean individual questionand all i would say is you knowif it's yourthe only mobile wallet you've gottenit's on your daily phone i would use theequivalent of how much cash would youphysical cash would you carry aroundwith you um you know what's your limitat which it's gonna start um affectingyour life if you used to lose thatbalance umthe quick review the mobile wallet themobile wallet should be like almostconsideredis is like your spending wallet what youwould have right inin in your back pocket but uhgoing further when we go into moremethods of storing your bitcoin thatwould be more like a savings accountum except i you're about to say a caveatuh i mean i have my own caveat i wouldsayi thinkespecially if you're using a reputableonei think people can feel a little bitmore comfortable than the kind of amountof cash they would carry in their pocketum i know like i wouldn't feel morecomfortable i wouldn't feel thatcomfortable carrying more than like 400in my pocketum but like a mobile wallet especiallyif it's your first wallet you're justgetting started you're gettingcomfortable you have your seed wordsbacked upuh your phone's up to dateyou know we don't seehacks are theoretically possibleobviously phones get compromised all thetimeumbut i i would probably if i had to picka number i'd like being like the 5 000to 10 000 rangelike that's where you start having toreallyconsider securing it moreum and you should also operate under theassumption because bitcoin tends togo up fastumyou should be prepared ahead of timebecause it could beyou know it could be a thousand dollarsin there and then in six months it couldbe worth eight thousand dollarsyeah the the other thing i would say aswell is that thisalmost everybody has got a spare phonelying around at the house that you knowyou could use that as your sort ofdedicated bitcoin phone and where youcouldbe slightly more comfortable storing youknow maybe larger amountsrelative to the individual and and thenyou could kind of decant off into yoursort of daily phone what you might wantto spend on a day-to-day basisabsolutely nothing wrong with thatapproach as well if you didn't want toand shell out quickly for for umfor a hardware wallet which we can wecan come on to now and so hardwarewallet is well before we get to hardwarewallets you also havethere's also software wallets on on thecomputer that you can haveright so you have mobile wallets youhave software wallets on your computerwhere it's like you install an app onyour computerumi i mean i would saylike unless you're an advanced user andyou have like a dedicated computer andthis episode isn't for advanced usersthey should probably shy away from thatin the beginning i i think the mobilesecurity model is a stronger securitymodel as you know as long as you're notworried about like the nsa or somethingum or like the chinese intelligenceservicesor these intelligence services um mostmost of the population uh are not greatat securing their their computer uh mostpeople's computers are unless you'resort ofa bit of a hacker man there's this youknow a far more vulnerable device thanyour mobile phone iswhich is why like you said you know icompletely agree that i don't recommendthem especially for larger amounts umand i tend to sort of skip straight tothe hardware wallet after the mobilewallet stageumsohardware wallets um are essentially adedicated uh physical deviceum designed to manage the the keys thatcontrol your bitcoin um so with thembeing a a physical dedicated device youknow their one purpose is to secure yourbitcoin whereas your phone hasyou know it's essentially a computer inyour pocket and with all of that extrafunctionality that your phone hascompared to a hardware walletincreases the theoretical attack vectorswhere hackers orthe nsa whoever can umsort of try and attempt to get theirhands on your bitcoin so these devicesare very focused andthey're focused at securing your bitcoinfrom physical attack um and also uh fromum digital attack ie uh you knowsomebody stealing your keys um over theinternet if you were to connect one ofthese devices to your uhvery likely highly insecure computerumso they a lot of them most of the goodones um work uh you know that theirprimary umway of of sort of keeping things secureis that they operate with what's knownas an air gap where they they canoperate without being connectedphysically to to any other device andbecauseit's that physical umconnection that sometimes can introduceuh uh intro um extrathreat factors so the the idea just todistill it here like the idea of ahardware wallet is that you have aa device that's builtto securely hold your bitcoin welltechnically it's holding the keys toyour bitcoinum butfor all intents and purposes it's it'syou can think of it as holding yourbitcoin and and it interacts with eitheryour computer or your phone in a waythat those keysall the keys are what protect yourbitcoin gives you access to bitcoin andyou don't want someone else to haveaccess to those keys it keeps those keysoff that computer or off that phone soit stays on the deviceand that device is never connected tothe internet sothethe basic concept behind securingyour stash with a hardware wallet isthatuh for someone to compromise you theyneed to physically have access to youand the device orif they can compromise the device justthe device but they like have to comeinto your home or come into your officeand get that device rather than hackingyou through the internetright and you know the even um if ageneric attacker was togain physical access to to most of thesedevices and they're still going to um afair bit of time and a hell of a lot ofequipment to be able to um you knowcrack theum protections on the device to be abletoaccess the keys um and to be able tosteal your bitcoin so it's not just acase of umprotecting you from a malware infestedcomputer um if somebody was to break inthere's still pin protection on thedevice and so it's not just a case ifyou lose the device um and you loseaccess to your bitcoin again the thepremise that matt spoke about beforeabout writing down your seed words um isexactly the same with a hardware walletuh the differences here is that um thethe when you sort of uh generate thosethose 24 or 12 words and it's done in anoffline environment that's never beenconnected to the internet so that againit just removes that extra threat vectorwhere um you're not connected to anysort ofinternet connected devices so it's justthat extra layer or wrapper of securityperfectumshould wewhat is your favorite hardware walleti saw that one coming a mile offum so full disclosure um i work for a umhardware wallet manufacturer calledfoundation devicesand obvious biases aside i genuinelybelieve that we make the umthe best option for a beginner enteringthe space umit's incredibly secure but also veryeasy to operate uh so i should havenamed the devices called passport andand another great device is the callcard umwhich is probably looks a little bitscarier to the newcomer i would say umbut has some extra features um thatmight bemore beneficial for more advanced usersthat they could sort of leverage sothose would be my two favorites yeah iwould say my favorite is uh cold cardumi've used multiple versions of coldcards i highly recommend them umand then ifwe're not really going to go intocoins here but if youabsolutely need to gamble onother coins in the space rather thanjust bitcoin uh both foundation and coldcard are bitcoin onlyumi mean so i i would say either use aledger or a treasureuh hardware wallet if if you wantcoin support um but even in thatsituation you probably shouldgo with a bitcoin only hardware walletfor your bitcoin and then use the otherones for your coins and just likethe mobile wallets there are lots ofreally bad harder wallets out thereso don't just googlebest hardware wallet because a lot ofinfluencers are paidtopromote them so you'll see youtubevideos with 500 000 views saying to usea horrible hardware wallet soconsider thatyeah what i would say just to back thatup again is that you know likelihood isif you're listening to this that you'reat least aware um ofyou know bitcoin twitter and the peoplethat are umaround and popular on there and most ofthose people have been around for a goodnumber of years and they've probablytried all of these devices so look towhat most most of theirmost of those people are using or atleast recommended and when you're sortof doing your own research to see whichdevice is going to be best for youperfectumwhen they're using their hardware walletthey need to use it with awith software they need to use it withan appso what are your recommendations forwhich apps they should use with theirhardware walletthe best two for meif you want to stay on desktop whichgenerally gives you sort of a little bitmore extra functionality would be numberone be spiral wallet um hands down myfavorite umor if you like a little bit of a sort ofeasier to to operate interface with kindof lessadvanced features spectre desktop isalso a great onetwo great recommendations spectre usedto be my favorite now sparrow's myfavoriteyeah um whichmight uh be a good segue for what we'vegot coming up next uh well before we getthereyou can also useyou can also use both the cold card andthe foundation passport with blue walleton mobile so if youare going through the steps and you gotcomfortable with blue wallet alreadyum because you started with a mobilewallet uh you can then use blue walletwith both of those hardware walletswhich is nice especially i mean i ithink some people listening to thisprobably don't have a computer that'sso a lot of people don't have computersthey just have the computer in theirpocketyeah you know we're heading towards amobile first world aren't we if not ifwe're not already there and blue walletdoesoffer a great interface uh especially uhwith with the with the passport with theqr interfaces uh very very slick andvery easy to wrap your head around as abeginnerawesome okay so you want to go to thenext topicyou said yeah let'slet's hit nodes yeah so i talked aboutum inspector desktop and one of thegreat features about like the desktop isit actually has a built-in bitcoin nodeso uh the next step along your journeyuh hopefully will be to look to run yourown bitcoin nodeum a bitcoin node is you can look at itas your umsort of interface into your into thebitcoin world and it's going to be thatnext step along the sovereignty journeyso that you can and again one of the thebuzz phrases that you hear in the spaceis verify your own transactionsand so when you receive uh any bitcointransactionand that will bebeing passed to you via a whole networkof nodesand the wallet that you choose to usewill be connected to a node now thatnode could be uma centralized node or operated by anexchange uh it could bea node that you don't know who existsthat might actually be a chainsurveillance company or hopefully itcould be your own node that you can runum in your house relatively cheaplynow the benefits of of running your ownnode like i said is you can verify yourown transactions so that you can be surewhen somebody's sending you atransaction and that the transactionabides bythe this sort of rule set umthat the the network that you've chosento join umthat we all agree on uh to put that alittle bit simplea little bit simpler is that you canbe sure that sort of nobody's trying tocheat you and send you some fake bitcoinor a transaction that's not valid and sothat you know you might be selling goodsor services and they might be paying youin bitcoin for thatandand if you weren't verifying your owntransactions they might be able to umsend you um the way i like to frame itis it's using your own note to interactwith the bitcoin network you have to usea node and if you don't use your ownnodeumyou don't have counterfeit detection isis like kind of how i like to view itsomeone can kind of trick youuh into it into thinking you havebitcoin when you don't have bitcoin soyou want to use your own node for thatpurpose and then second of all which ithink is almost more tangible to peoplebecause to be honest uh we haven't seenthat's more of a theoretical attack andwe haven't really seen it play out itcould still play out in the future youshould assume it it will so you want touse your own node for counterfeitdetection but second of all it alsoif you don't use your own node um you'retrusting your privacy with whoever'snode you're using so you want to useyour own node so that you don't have totrusta potential potentially a stranger or acompanywith that that private transactioninformation and balance informationyeah it's about removing trustessentially and and by running your ownnode you're you're putting the trust inthe hardware and or the the softwarethat you are choosing to run uh not theone that's kind of been given to you ifyou're operating with an exchange or acentralized node runner and so there'suma a massive awash of choice and withvarying degrees oftechnical abilitythe the easiest way to get running withyour own nodeis to download a piece of softwarecalled bitcoin corethis is kind of the the sort of uh defacto software built by the the bitcoincore developers uh that is essentially apiece of software that you can in acouple of clicks download onto yourlaptop or desktop and and it will startto download the your own copy of theblockchain so that you can umtransact with the built-in wallet andto just to get started and verify yourown transaction that way that'sabsolutely the easiest way and as itouched on earlier uh spectre desktopactually has umessentially that built in as well justpackaged in a slightly different way foryou and so they're they're absolutelyfree and within a couple of clicksyou'll be on the way to downloading yourown copy of the blockchain and havingyour own node set upthe problem with a setup like that isthat umyou i can't really um generally speakingconnect any mobile wallets to it so ifyou were to want to transact when you'reout and about and you run bitcoin coreon your laptopand you wanted to send the transactionthe likelihood is you're not gonna haveyour laptop with you so you you know youwon't be able to to spend as easily assome of the node options that we'regoing to come up come on to uh in asecond i'll just pause see if matt's gotanything to add thereumyeah so i mean if you're using bitcoincore or if you're using the built-inbitcoin core inspectoruh yeah correct your you can't the mainnegative is you can't use it with themobile wallet the also the othernegative isum your transaction and balance infowill be on your computer so if it'sa computer you use for work or acomputer you use uhto play games or look at porn orsomething like that your social mediahabitit might be easily compromised and thatbecomes a it becomes mostly it becomes aprivacy issueumbecause all your transaction historywill be there and all of your balancehistory will be thereum but also you can't use it with mobilewallets which is a key component as wellyeah so so the next best option um andunfortunately the most expensive optionis what's known as a plug and play nodeso this is where you'll buyessentially a small box from one of thevarious teamsto name a few we've got uh ronin dojowe've got raspi blitz we've got startnine uh umbrell there's loads ofdifferent companies or my nodeno nothere's loads popping up um all withdifferent feature sets but essentiallythey sell your boxuh that you plug in at home you plug itinto your router you plug it into thepower outletand then within a couple of clicksyou're off and running again to to getyour own copy of the blockchain and haveyour no your own node up and runningand before we move on uh civil dispatchuhcivil dispatch 26i had all the major node teams on for aconversation ontheir node projects so if you'reinterested in having one of thesepurpose-built boxes or you a lot ofthose projects that were just namedallow you to actually buy the hardwareseparatelyand then install their software on it umconsider listening to that sill dispatchright so and the the kind of finaloption is the diy approach like matt'sjust touched on where all of theprojects that we just said and we'llhave a parts list you can go away andbuyspend a couple hundred dollars buying ahard drive and a single board computerand a couple of other cablesand build your own node and put your ownsoftware well put the software thatthese teams provideand onto that hardware uh the the endresult is that you get um the same nodewith all the same features um obviouslythe caveat is that you've got to gothrough the process of buying thehardware yourself flashing the softwareand onto a micro sd card uh which mightcause you some you know if you're a lesstechnical user and you're lesscomfortable with taking that approachand that's why the teams offer theplug-and-play note it does sound moreintimidating than it actually isand i would absolutelyso like i encourage new users to gettheir feet wet um also juston thejust to go back a little bit aboutbitcoin core i mean if you're using youcan use you can also use bitcoin core ifyou're running bitcoin core on the samecomputer you're running spectre on or asparrow they both can connect to itumif you do that process you really shouldbe using it on a dedicated computer iknow i like kind of touched on thatearlier when i said you know if you'reusing it for playing games or socialmediait could get compromised easier becauseyou're using it for all these othergeneral purposes you're downloadingsoftware on it that maybe you haven'tverified you definitely haven't verifiedand have no idea what's really runningthereum so if you are going to go thatapproachyou should have a dedicated device youshould consider a dedicated computer adedicated phone that you are using withit um and uhyeah in general dedicated devices areare going to be more secure and moreprivate you'rewhen we when we talk about security andbitcoin land whereyou don't don't let perfect be the enemyof good don't get overwhelmed becauseyour setup's not perfect but at the sametime you're just trying toreduce your threats so that you're notthe lowest hanging fruit most of thetime when we see these hacks it'stargeted at the people that are mostvulnerableyeah and the just to go back to the diyapproach that was outlining umall of these uh different projects thatwe've spoken about have got reallyreally good documentation and quitevibrant communities as well uh ontwitter telegram or their own dedicatedforum and so don't be afraid to you knowgo and have a browser the documentationlike matt said it's not actually asscary as i made it sound um and also youknow go and ask some questions in the inthe telegram chat or in the slack orwhatever you know um chat room that thethe the project has gotum you'll probably find or you'lldefinitely find thatall of these the people that are inthese communities are really welcomingand they've definitely been in yourposition before now and and you knowthey they found uh the thought of thisreally scary a couple of years ago andyou know now they might be runningseveral diy notes so they'll be don't beoff-put by it100um i will echo that sentiment i wouldjust add a slight caveat that there arescammers in these telegram groups andthese chat rooms um they will often tryand impersonateuhpeople that are involved with theproject or other notable figures to tryand get you feel comfortable never nevergive anybody uh your seed words thosesecret backup boards never give themtheir secret backup boardsand you know always be skeptical ifsomeone in one of those groups tries todm you separately and tries to go into aprivate chat you know sometimes it islegit but you need to be extra cautiousin that type of situationyeah and and if somebody does don't beafraid to ask in in the sort of mainroom you know tag the person who youthink might have dmd you and said isthat his issue at the mme exactly butalways uh just act on the the on air onthe side of caution and and keep thatsort of adversarial mindset to think youknow why is this person reaching out tome completely out of the blue after ijust asked my first question enteringthe room100um so all those node projectssupport something called electrum serverand electrum server is a standardumit's it's a standard way to interactwith your own node um you can use thoseelectrum server details and then you canput them into sparrowyou can put them into many of the mobilewallets that we mentioned earlier youcan put them into blue walletwith samurai specificallythey don't use electrum server they usesomething calleddojoand with that pairing is as simple asthere's a qr code and you just scan theqr code with your samurai wallet on yourphone and it'll pair up with your nodeyeah the good thing is with dojo as wellis it's uh implemented in the vastmajority of the the note packages nowthere's there's more that have dojo thatthen don't which is really great to seeindeedshould we hit on the coin joinokay soi i just want you know we're we're anhour inum if you're a newcomer you just listento this hour and you're intimidated as uh don't be intimidated you knowstart with step one where we talkedabout acquiring your bitcoinumthen you know learn how to hold your ownkeys and slowly move through the processdon't you know freak yourself out thatyou know now now i gotta run a node toolike i'm now i'm really intimidated youknow step by step get your feet wet getcomfortable send transactions receivetransactions back up your wallet restoreyour wallet just get comfortable with itget used to it don't it's not somethingto be scared of it's something that youlearn by doingyeah i uh i put a tweet a couple ofweeks ago actually that kind of echoesthat that you know if uh sending atransaction uh makes you feel a littlebit uneasy then you haven't sent enoughtransactions um you can see on screenthere that the mempool is uh you knowit's a little bit busy than what it wasbut a couple of sats per bite is goingto get your transaction confirmed veryquickly and that's going to cost you youknow less than a dollar to send atransaction so we don't have we don'thave that on the list but before we moveon to coin join on chain privacyutxo management we should probablyhow does how does a newcomer choose whatfee to pay they open up their walletthey go to send a transactionumwhat like how do bitcoin transactionfees work i feel like that is somethingwe tend to gloss overyeah we overlooked that one um wellfortunately most of the the good mobilewallets especially the ones that we'veuh mentioned uh on tonight's stream uhwill give you a couple of options uhwhere you canum you'll they'll either have you knowthree options sort of low prioritymedium priority and high priority likeagain like we can see on screen or theremight be a slider where you can manuallyadjust the feeand essentially the the higher that thefee you pay the more likely that uh yourtransaction is going to be uh confirmedor processed quickeruh againa caveat with that one we've got a lotof caveats tonight is that umthe uh some of the estimation the feeestimations umthese wallets all use different sort ofalgorithms as to how they um calculateor estimate the fee that would berequired to get you confirmed in thedisplayed priorityso matt's got on screen here a reallygreatwebsite called mempool.spaceum which can it shows you again the thepriority uh fee selections uh or what itwould adviseand based on uh correct me from wronggame map but based on what's currentlyin the mempool um as well as sort ofhistorical data as well so it's kind ofaalways a really good sort of accuratelook at you know if you want to get yourtransaction processed within the nextblock uh right now it would take anestimate of 13 sats per byte um butagain there's a little caveat here thatthere's still umtransactions with much lower transactionfees umthan 13 sats per byte that will also getget confirmed so it's kind of umit's not an exact science uh i will saythatbut multiple sources is always a goodone if you want to try and uhget it sort of nailed so i mean bitcoinis a run by a companybitcoin is adistributed networkum and so as a result how bitcointransactions workiswe have this chain of transactionsand the transactions are within blockswe call them blocksumroughly every 10 minutes there'll be anew bitcoin block and it will havefinalized transactions included in thatblockuntil you get into a blockyou sit in a waiting list that waitinglistis we call that the mempool we call itamenpool technically every node hastheir own mempoolumbut if your internet connection is solidin most situations those mempools shouldall look the same so when you go tomempool.space you're looking at theirmempool that will look very similar toif you looked at the same thing on yourown node which a lot of these nodeprojects by the way allow you to runmempool.space natively with your ownnodesothebasically you have this like free marketthat's constantly going on where you'redecide wherepeople are choosing which fee they'rewilling to spend and miners are going tousuallyinclude you in a block based on yourorder in that waiting list based on howmuch you want to spendso if it's a transaction between someoneyou trust um and you're willing to waita longer period of time you can pay alower fee if you're sending just toyourself you can pay the lowest fee wecall that's one sap per byte is thelowest fee because you're just sendingit to yourselfum you know if if in some crazysituation where a one sapper by nevergets confirmed ever which we've neverbeen through you can always resend thattransactionso you're gonna want touh choose your transaction fee based onthe urgency you want that transactionfinalized on the networkand most good wallets will basicallygive you a low medium and highyou knowthislow being i can wait medium being likei'm in the middle ground because it'smedium and high being i don't want towait i want it finalized as soon aspossibleyeah andit'sit's a very much a dynamic thing it'slike a queue that's always evolvingevery single second because there's moreand more transactions being sent youknow every second andumit's not within you know outside therealms of possibility thatwhat the fee that you put up right thissecondmight not be enough to get youimmediately uh processed into the nextblock in sort of five minutes timeum so it's it's very very dynamic andyou know that's why i said it's not sortof an exact science so generallyspeaking for most people the walletestimators are pretty good especially ifit's an urgent transaction that you needto be processedimmediately100 i'm glad we covered that topicum also uhjust uh before we move on to the nexttopic just to jump backwith hardware wallets uhyou know the backup to that hardwarewallet are those words you wrote downumyou have the option of putting them intosteel these steel plates are availablemany different vendors offer the steelplatesand the idea there is if you put it intosteel obviously it's going to be waterresistant and fire resistant it's goingto be more sturdy than paperyou might also consider makingduplicates of those seed words andhaving them in different places so likeif your office burns down or your houseburns down it's still in the otherlocationwith the caveat that it meansit could be more likely that someoneelse finds it because it's in morelocations so you need to think aboutthat very carefullyand then third of all with hardwarewallets which i forgot to mentionone thing i like to tell new coinersis it's a good idea to have to buy twoof whatever you decide to buybecause if you have a second oneyou canyou can have the same backup wordsinitialized on both devicesso then if something happens to yourdevice not only do you have the seedwords available those those secretbackup words available to restore yourdevice you also have the second devicethat still has access to your funds soyou're not in a panic situationum so i always i tend to recommend topeople that they should buy two of thesame device whichever they choose umso that they they can have twoinitialize and you can keep those inseparate locations as wellif you wantokay yeah i think that's good adviceso when you're opening up a bitcoinwallet it shows a balanceum a common misconception isthatthat you know you just it shows yourbitcoin balance that's what's in yourwallet but in reality what's in yourwallet is basically a bunch of differentbitcoin transactions that all add up tothat balanceum we call those utxos uhthose those are unspent transactionoutputs utxos is what we call them youcan think of them like bills in yourwallet like maybe your wallet you knowyour cash wallet has50 in it but in reality it has two 20sand a 10and that's how bitcoin wallets work soyou have all these small utxos in therethat add up to your balance and that hasprivacy implicationsbecause ififtwo of those utxos come togetherum in a single transaction they'reobviously linked on this chainuh forever right we call it theblockchain it's this ledger oftransactions they'll be linked togetherbecause they were both spent in the sametransactionso that brings us to this idea of utxomanagementand coin control the idea oftrying tomanage thosebitcoin transactions in a privacy andcost effective way should you want to gointo that a little bityeah definitely um and quick i willstart with the two wallets that we keepmentioning blue wallet and samurai umoffer all the features that i'm justabout to cover that sort of help when itwhen it comes to to utxo managementandinspectoryeah sorry yeah i keep referring tomobile wallets but yeah the all of thedesktop uh the good desktop wallets thatwe've spoken about i've all got utxomanagement features as well um sothere's a couple of facets to it thefirst one is the ability to uh label thethe utxos or the pieces of bitcoin thatyou've got in your wallet so what wouldbe an example of a label might be thatif matt was to pay me for dinner uh orpay me back for dinner um when ireceived that transaction into my walleti could put a label on that to say thatthat's come from martin it was fordinnerum i could then receive my wages from myemployerumand i could put the the relevant labelon that just to know that where theorigin uhof that utxo is fromumso the once i've labeled themwhen i'm making future transactionsand i'mthere's two ways you can make atransaction you can let the wallet toconstruct it for you automatically whichthey might choose any random utxos andmerge them together again like matt saidto which will show common ownership thatmight not be a problem however if you uhwant to preserve your privacy and imight not want my employer to know thati'm friends with matt because he's a badperson um because i've labeled those i'mnot a bad person thoughbecause i play radical[Music]because i've labeled those utxos when ireceived them at the time um in you knowtwo weeks down the line when i'm goingto make a transaction um i can then chyou know consider and the person thati'm paying you know do i want them toknow that i know matt or do i want themto know that i work for the company thatpaid me uh with this utxo i can makethat informed decision then to say wellactually i'm just going to spend fromone of those pieces of bitcoin oractually it's not a bad thing matt's notreally a bad person i'm gonna combinethe two uh because the value that i wantto send i need to combine the twoum so those are the two two sort of mainfacets to it and and but obviously youcan't ummake a an informed decision when youcome to spend um if you don't know theorigins of all of the etxos that you'vegot and so they kind of go hand in handreally um you need to label so that whenyou come to spend you can make theinformed decision as to whether youshould merge or not yeah so a key aspectof bitcoin isif someone sends you bitcointhey can see where that bitcoin goes inthe futureand if you receive bitcoin you can seewhere that bitcoin came from in the pastsothis is why labeling is importantbecause you want to knowwhere that transaction came fromor it goes tobecausethat's who you're exposing your privacyto in that situationis that a good yeah installation yeahwhich you know um might not be a problemfor you know the person that i'm payingmight not um be able toor be clever enough to to use blockchainanalysis um but the other sort of umadversary that we need to consider hereis chain analysis firms that might betrying to umcluster or monitor your unchain activitywho you're spending to who you'regetting change back from uh to monitoryour habits to try and um piece togetherumyou know the identity because theblockchain doesn't have any identitiesat that at the blockchain layer um butthese companies work to kind oftie all the pieces together so that theycan um de-anonymize people and so it'snot just a case of umyou know hiding how much you earn fromyour friend uh it's also you know thesemore sophisticated actors that have gotmore a lot more resources to throw atthis and that you've also got to bear inmind as well unfortunately yeah you bothyou both don't want you don't want youremployer to knowwhat you're spending things onand you don't want the guy who sells youa sandwich to know how much money youmakebut on top of that we also have theseprofessional surveillance mercenariesthat work for governments dictators andcompaniesand they are just out there constantlytrying to track bitcoin transactions soyou also have that as a concernwhich leads us nicely onto coinjoin ithink if unless there's anything elseyou want to touch on no let's yep we cantalk about coinjoin now so coinjoin umis um acoordinated or collaborative transactionwhereyou and at least one other personwillcollaborate to construct the transactionthat casts some doubtas to theorigin and the output of the transactionto umto make suream thatstill could you still hear mei can still hear you yes oh sorry ithought i dropped out yes it's acoinjoin is a collaborative transactionwhere umthe the idea is that theuh somebody watching the blockchainagain chain surveillance firm youremployer your friend whoever they can'tumdeterministically orwith good probability be able to trackthepeople on the input side of thetransaction to the output side of thetransactionso it effectively attempts to put upsort of um a brick wall in your you knowthe the utxos history so that umanybody looking on chain can't be sure100umyou know is there one person involved inthis transaction is there 10 peopleinvolved in this transaction it justcasts doubt on the the uh path that thebitcoin has taken and and who sort of umyou know has the bitcoin change handshasn't it we we're not really sure so sotracking bitcoin is a probability gameumthese surveillance companies and theirtools will basically or just someonewho's curious and trying to spy on youum will basically assign a probabilityto every transaction if ownership haschanged because one of the things aboutbitcoin isyou know i could send bitcoin to myselfor i could send it to bitcoin q a anduh the chain doesn't delineate betweenthat so a key aspect of tracking bitcointransactions isumdetermining some kind of probabilitythat bitcoin actually changed hands andthen from there trying to seewhich hands it went from from who to whoum so coinjoin is this idea of acollaborative transaction and you canthink of it likeumjust for an example if you have fivepeople that are doing a coin jointtogetherinstead of uh having a simple path thatyou're following on chain and decidingif ownership has changed um all of asudden there's five different potentialpaths it could go downyou don't know which of the five peoplethat participatedwhich of their five outputs are themso it breaks that probability chainand it's a useful tool in terms oftrying torecr to have forward privacy have thisidea of someone who sent you bitcoindoesn't necessarily know which path yourbitcoin took going forwardyeah and specifically with umimplementations of coinjoin likewhirlpool which are known as equaloutput coin joints um the the the sortof notion is that everybody um on theoutput side all of the utx on the outputside of the transactionlook absolutely identical and soit's kind of uh i always like to use theanalogy of v for vendetta where you'vegot the million mask marchit's essentially the same thing but onthe blockchain where all of these utxosare indistinguishable from one anotherand so like matt said you've got someforward privacyand be quickand soi the the three major coin jointprojects our samurai whirlpool joinedmarket in wasabiumcitadel dispatch 15 was with the wasabiteam civil dispatch 16was with the join market teamand civil dispatchi don't know where he is i also did asamurai oneum is citadel dispatchit's there in your feed somewhere youknow uhstefan can just rattle them off he knowsexactly which one is which always amazesme that umi don't know which one it is i'll comeback to it and tell you but it's there'sthere's another dispatch with thesamurai team so if you're interested inthis uh consider going back andlistening to those threeumme and bitcoin q auh like samurai whirlpool the best youcan also you you don't have to usesamurai walla with it you can usesparrow wallet with it as wellumyeah yeah co-sign that samurai orsparrow a hands-down win is for me umespecially from a from a beginner'sperspective um definitely the easiestones to get started with in my opinionyou can continue on i'm trying to figureout which dispatchi'lli'll cover off one quick question that'sum quite on topic and somebody askedwhat's the difference betweenum coinjoin that we've just spoken abouton a coin tumbler so the unfortunatelythe words uh or the the meanings havebeen kind of umwhitewashed somewhat over the years butum generally speaking a coin tumbler isa centralized service where you willhave tosend inyour bitcoin and give up a custody of itto whoever's running the tumbler andthey will send you somebody else'sbitcoin backand i absolutely wouldn't recommendanybody use thesebecause you're putting yourselfum completely in the hands of whoever'srunning the tumbler and that you knowwhether they're going to send you yourbitcoin back or notand yeah soand you also not only you're trustingthem with your bitcoin if you use acustodial mixer it's the same ideas ascustodyum because custodial risks with walletsum you're also you're trusting them withyour privacy and your fundsum so the key aspect of coinjoin is isthe idea that you are reducing trust inany kind of centralized third party umwasabi and samurai have a centralizedserver that they doum[Music]that they use to coordinate the coinjoins to make them easier better uxuh and more reliablethose coordinators are blindedwith samurai specifically you can use itwithout your own node and then you'retrusting samurai's node so that goesback to our earlier conversation aboutusing your own node you should use yourown node when you use samuraiotherwise you are trusting them withyour transaction and balance informationas as is the case with all light walletsum i found it so so it's still dispatch15 is wasabi still dispatch 16 is joinedmarket and still dispatch 30 is samuraiso consider listening to thoseokay i think are we done on coinjsshould we move on to the next topic um ihave multisig as the next topic butshould we do lightning real quick firstsure thing yeah yeah i think it's apt umsoquick high level on what the thelightning network is uh it is a scalingsolution for bitcoin that umallows you toum transact with uhactual real bitcoin um but you don't doso with what's known as an on-chainfootprint and so it allows you to sortof lock up a small amount of well asmuch bitcoin as you want onto thissecond layer solution known as thelightning networkso that you can umyou essentially just defer the theoverall settlement um of any number oftransactions from going on chain to toreduce fees and also to allow you totransact um much quickerso whereas uh one on chain transactionyou know might cost you a couple hundredsats depending on the fees and you youmight be able to send you know 10or even 100lightning network um transactions forthe sameuh for the same amount of fees um nowthere is uhunfortunately lots of caveats with thelightning network again in terms ofbeing able to do it properly uh with uhthe best way to do so be with one of theuh no packages that we've spoken aboutbefore andwhich will dictate that you need tomanage your own sort ofyour own channels which is essentiallywhere you lock up this bitcoin to beable to to transact on this second layerumso it's a little bit more of a hurdle toto get on board with um but you you sortof can save yourself a fair bit on feesespecially if we ever see a feast bikeagain um which i think is inevitable umthe i don't knowinevitable um sofirst of all there's been a lot ofdispatches on lightning if you gothrough the feedconsider listening to those there's likea lot of different caveats and nuanceswhen using lightningspecifically with privacy i did a fullprivacy episode with openobs and anthonythat's still dispatch 21 that's onlightning privacyuh so consider checking that out but themain differentiation that you as a newuser should think about with lightningis going back to our transaction feeconversation earlierwhich iswhen you use a regular bitcointransactionyour transaction fee is not based on theamount you send it could be kind ofweird for youuh it's it's actually based on theamount of utxos that you useuh for the transaction it's based on thedata size not the amount of money thatis sentsoyou could end up sending a five dollartransaction with bitcoin on chain aregular bitcoin transaction and it couldcost the same as sendinga five million dollar transactionnow with lightningit's different the way fees arecalculated on lightning is based on theamount you're sending so that'll be morecomparable to something that you're usedto in traditional finance world where ifyou send more money you're going to paya higher fee you send less money you'regoing to pay a lower feenowuh moon wallet with 2us as we talkedabout earlier mobile wallet supportslightningand blue wallet supports lightning nowif you use blue wallet in its defaultstate with lightning it's going to be acustodial walletwhich i don't loveuh if you insist on using it use it witha small amount because they can takeyour funds you are trusting them withyour privacy um ifuhyou can also use blue wallet withsomething called lnd hub which some ofthese node projects offeri think umbral and my node offered idon't know who else offers it but if youuse it with lnd hub or your friend's lndhub then it's not custodial with bluewallet it's custodial with who's everrunning the lnd hub so if you run thelnd hub yourselfthen it's not custodialotherother lightning specific wallets onmobilethat you can use so moon does bothblue wallet does boththen there's lightning specific mobilewallets that are very good uh there'sphoenixwallet uh there's breeze walletumbreeze b-r-e-e-zcontinuing the bitcoin naming scheme ofusing words and spelling themdifferently um is there anotherlightning wallet that i'm missinglightningeclair as well haven't youwell claire is phoenixphoenixyeah why do they have two okay but yeahboth of those are good yeah one allowsyou to manage your own channels and theother one does it for youokay phoenix does it for youyepokay so forget eclair your new corneryou have phoenix and you have breezewallet or you can use moon or bluewallet and that'srather than for savings you should thinkof that more asokay this is like my spending wallet mytransaction fees are based on the amounti send i'm going to be sending smalleramounts umso i i might use lightning rightyeah i agree i'm quite a big fan ofphoenix um especially from a perspectiveof you know one that a wallet thatmanages the channels for you and i mightget a lot of for this in the chatbut i'm i'm a firm believer that mostnew users don't shouldn't strive todive head first into lightning withtheir own channels because it's it'sit's not easy it's not approachable andeverything that we've already discussedum in terms of holding your own keys umuh using coinjoin and and not using kycare far more important than uh strivingto get your own channels up and runningum quickly uh i don't know what youthink about that matt and i'm waitingfor the in the chat no i mean ithink i i i think umlightning on mobile uh with the walletswe just mentioned moon blueum breeze phoenixfor smaller spending amountsuh is very accessibleuh actuallyif you if you actually want to dolightning in a proper sovereign wayum that i would say is a more advancedthing don't get intimidated by it but ii think it's important for ourall-encompassinggetting started guide that we do mentionit it exists and what are the you knowdifferent trade-offs basically thetrade-off there is a little bit you'regetting less security uh you're gettingless reliability with lightning umbut you're getting lower feesfaster transactions all else equalum[Music]and it could be very useful in a mobilespending type of situationyeah i agreephoenix and brees really great ways toto get started with lightning that havesort of their own unique um trade-offsuh that kind of give the the best ofboth worlds from it from a new userperspectivewhen you compare them with umcustodial solutions like the defaultblue wallet or running your own channelsand that's one of theyeah i mean that's one of the reasonswhy i like moon so much like moon with2us has like different tradeoffsum it doesn't have a standardized backupprocessuh it's you know if if you'rea lot of big corners will say it's youknow not a lightning wallet but at theend of the dayit's not a lightning wallet because youstore all your funds on chain you're notstoring it in a proper lightning walletum but what's cool about moon isif you scan a qr code it could be alightning qr code or it could be aregular bitcoin qr code and it justautomaticallyfigures that out for youum and and vice versa yeah so so you canjust have you can have some spendingcash in your moon wall at muunand whatever whatever bitcoin qr codeyou scan it will send but it doesn'thave power user features it doesn't havethat coin selection that we were talkingabout with utxo management it doesn'thave labelingit doesn't have a standard backupprocessso these are all things to keep in mindright multisig multisig let's let's gohere's where we get into the weeds alittle bit um right so you've been inthe weeds for a whileall of the uh wallets that we've spokenabout umthe desktop wallets mobile wallets alloperate umon what we colloquially call a singlesig setup where they have um a singlesecret or backup um which is requiredwhen you want to spend your bitcoin amulti-sig wallet is where you combinetwo or more of theseseparate wallets together to create abrand new walletwhen you set up this multisig wallet youcan dictatethe minimumamount of keys required to be able tomake ato sign or authorize a send transactionso that could betwo from a possible three keys is apopular one all the way up to somethingelaborate like 11 or 15 you know whichmight be uh used in sort of a businesssetting props um but two of three whereyou need two signers from a possiblethree that were created to that we useto create the wallet to sign off on anytransactions from that wallet so whywould you want to do that wellwith a single sig wallet and some of thethree theoretical attack vectors ifsomeone's to someone but somebody was tosteal your deviceand and umwhile you know if they snatch your phonewhile it's out of your hand and you'vegot your wallet unlocked um they cansteal your bitcoin if that was one ofthe keys in a multi-sig wallet where youneeded two to spend from then they can'tsteal anything from youumanother one of the attacks that multisigprotect from is known as a retirementattack where there might be a malicioushardware wallet vendor thatdoesn't publish their source code um andthey umhave some uhmalware baked into into the the into thedevice and that is actually uh has theability to stealyour bitcoin i will say again correct meif i'm wrong game out but that has neverhappened again it's a theoretical attackbut if you were to use um a multi-sigsetup where you've got differenthardware wallet manufacturers if one ofthose is is maliciousum they can't get access to your fundsbecause they don't have you know if it'sjust one key out of two that arerequired they don't have the uhthe minimum number of keys required tosteal anythingall the goodall the good wallets all the goodhardware wallets are open source sotheoretically open source meansthat the code is available for you toverifyum and you can read the code line byline nowif you're a new coiner you're probablyup to this point you're already reallyintimidated you're like matt i can'tread codei'm aware okaysoat the end of the dayit is very good that you're able totechnically verify the code but mostpeople will be updating their hardwarewallets and they will not be verifyingthe code so there is some trust that youare you're trusting that hardware walletmanufacturer to not ship uh maliciouscode to you and you're also trustingthemuh that that the actual device wasn'tcompromised when it was first sent toyou right so with multisig the idea isyou can have multiple but specificallyin a hardware wallet ida hardware wallet multisig the idea isyou can have multiple vendorsuh that aremultiple different hardware wallets thatcome together to form your walletandyou needa combination of them as bitcoin q a wassaying a common one is two of three youneed two of them to spend the fundsthis reduces trust in any specifichardware wallet manufactureryou also have the added benefituh that those backup words instead ofthose backup words being aumone and done situation if someone findsthose secret backup words we call themseed words if someone finds those wordsthey have access to your funds in amulti-sig setup you haveummultiple sets of backup words and theyhave to find the required threshold ofbackup wordsin order to spend your funds so ifyou're using a two of three you're gonnahave three sets of backup words you'regonna have three hardware walletsthose backup boards obviously can be onsteel as we said earlierum and you can have them in differentlocations so bitcoin gives you bitcoinwith multisig gives you this uniquesituationwhere you can have a geographicallydistributeduh security setup where you're holdingyour own coinbutthethe the keys to access it can be locatedin different places they can beduplicated you can keep copies of themin different places and for someone toactually compromise you and take yourfunds they're gonna need to have accessto a combination secretwe lost bitcoin q a about two minutesago or a minute and a half ago and i'mjust gonna keep talking until hereconnectssothat is the main benefit of multisig[Music]do not once again do not get intimidatedhereuhplenty of people store bitcoin in singlesig uh setups it is thenormal way of setting it upum this is something you might graduatetouh multisig ux multisigumi guess ux can be kind of a complicatedwordlike the way you interface with themultisig walletis a relativelynew thing in bitcoinumso it it has a little bit more of alearning curve it is a little bit morerough around the edgessoyou want to get really comfortable withit as i said earlier you want to bebacking up restoring spending receivinggetting comfortable with it separatelyof your single sig setupnow one cool aspect of multisigis that you canactually have a single sig walletuh so you can be using a hardware walletthat is single sig and then you cantake that single sig and you canactually also use it in a multi-sigenvironmentandit can be one signer of for instance thetwo of three in the multi-sig but alsoit could also be its separate walletum andi guess the main advantage thereumi guess there's two main advantagesthere first of all if someone findsyour single sigback up your your secret words uh itmight have some small amount of funds onit and they think that's all your fundsthey they can't tell that it's in amulti-sig setupumso they might just take that funds andthink they took all your bitcoin umthis thesecondary benefit isthat you know you can repurpose thesethese hardware wallets and use them formultiple wallets now one other caveathere is with multi-sig you do want toback up additional information besidesjust your seed wordsumbitcoin q a came in and then left againso i will continueumthe popular multi-sig softwaresparrowspectre supports it blue wallet supportsitthey will tell you what you need to backup and make sure you save all thatinformation now that informationthat additional information that's notyour seed words umthey will have terms like derivationpathum descriptorthe list of something called x pubs youdon't necessarily have to know what allof that means you just have to save itand you just have to realize thatwhileseed words area security risk if someone gets yourseed wordsthat information that separateinformation that you have to back upwith a multi-stick wallet is a privacyrisk so if someone finds that they cansee how much you're holding in themultisig but they can't necessarilyspend itbut you need that information plus yourbackup boards in order touh to spend your funds bitcoin q are youbacki am apologies for that that'll happen ithink it's my networkno worries at all um i just continued onand i just kept talking about multisigdo you be holding it downumii get i mean i think we arei i think i sufficiently explainedmultisig tradeoffs and and benefitsumshould we move on to mistakes commonmistakesyeah did you cover sort of thealternatives to doing it yourself themultitec approach no i didn't that'sgreat why don't you go into thatyeah so obviously matt's just outlinedsome of the potential pitfalls withdoing it yourself umso one of the other options is known askind of collaborative custodyalternatives where um there will be acentralized service uhsome examples are on chain capital anduh casaumwhere they will help you coordinate amultisit quorum and where they hold oneof the keysand so that in the event that you wereto umso i'll give you an example you'd have akey on your mobile phoneyou'd have a key on a hardware walletand one of theseservices will hold the key as wellso they only have one key so they can'tsteal from you which is greatumbut if you were to lose say your phonewhat their key or the key on yourhardware while and he didn't have itbacked up they will be able to step inas a third party to help you move yourbitcoin so that in a doomsday scenarioand you um you don't lose your lifesavings which is really greatyou will pay for this service and againi'm not sure on how much each charge thebottom tier i think is just over 100umlast time i checked per year and one ofthe the trade-offs with this is that umunless you sign up uh without yourpersonal information which i believe isquite difficult to do umthethese uh centralized um entities thathold the key and part of yourmulti-sitcorum they know who you arethey know how much bitcoin you hold inthat wallet because they hold one of thekeys and they alsohold the sort of uhthe wallet file if you like to put itsimply and so that they canjust as a kyc exchange can umbe able to tie you to your bitcoinidentity so it's worth paying up thetrade-offs yeah and you're using theirnode sothe assumption is if you do this if youuse one of these providersuh you're trusting them with yourprivacy but they will hold your hand andthey will have a spare key for you aswellum and they will help you onboard intothe process they will help you gethardware wallets they will go throughthat whole process but you are trustingthem with your privacy they know yourtransactions they know your balancesandin 99 of situations they know who youare as well uh they'll know the ipaddress of your of your devices that youconnect fromthis is all kind of getting a little bittoo much into the weeds but the key isthat you're trusting them with yourprivacyum i was explaining earlier justbasically doing it yourself so you coulduse your own note and you aren'ttrusting someone in that situation youcan still haveumother people hold keys for you so abitcoin q a started with a two of threesetup because that's a very common setupbut another common setup is a three offive setup and if you do a three of fivesetup you have five total keys and youneed three to spendsoif you need three to spendyou can hold three keys yourself so thatyou know you have and you put them indifferent locations and you know youhave enough to spend it yourself butthen you can also have you know a familymember a frienda lawyerholdhold a key you can have differentcombinations of people hold the key soit can be very useful inum[Music]specifically in in situations whereyou're trying like inheritancesituations where if if you pass away youhave large bitcoin savings uh you knowmaybe a lawyer is holding one in a trustmaybe a couple family members areholding individual ones and theybasically all need to collaboratetogether in order to spend your funds ifyou have three keys with other peopleum but you can also do it in a way whereyou don'tyou don't they never have the thresholdthey need to compromise you pluscombined togetheryeah i think umjust one final thing before we move onto the next topic um inheritance is abig one for me that um i i sort of liketo drive over people who seem to seemkeen to kind of jump into the diyapproaches thatyou know you might have spent some timelistening to some podcasts watching someuh tutorials or reading some guides andfeel comfortable in setting up amultisigumsetup um but what happens if you're notaround tomorrow unexpectedly uh is yourspouse your next kin are they going tobe able to coordinate a spend from a twoor three or a three or five do they knowwhere to find the keys do they know howto recover it and if you answer no toany of those questions then uh all ofyour life savings disappears when youdisappear soand something to bear in mind especiallyif you're going to take the diy approach100 i'd also add that there's a middleground hereuh specifically supported by cold cardcalled seed xor and basically in thatsituation instead of having one seedit's not multisig but instead of havingone seed you have two seeds and you needboth of them in order to spend yourfundsso it's a little bit different thanmulti-sig it can be more accessible topeople uh because you don't have theseadditionalcomplications that we were justdiscussing with multi-sigbut it gives you that benefit of nothaving a single seedbackup wordsthat can be compromised by someonethere's also something that's supportedby pretty much every wallet out therecalled a passphraseand in that situation you have thesebackup boards are usually 12 wordphrases or 24 word phrases thepassphrase is the 13th word or the 25thword and you pick that yourselfso if you do that method then you cankeep the passphrase separate from yourbackup words if someone wants tocompromise you they need access to bothumand i mean if it's a weak passphrasethey might just take your backup boardsand keep trying pass raisesumbut it it adds an additional umburden on them to try and compromise youwithout going through a multi-sig setupum anotherinteresting thing about passphrases isyou can store money on the bear backupwords and then you cannot when you use apasswords it's a separate wallet soin that situation you can actually keepfunds on youryour basic backup boardsand then if someone finds that they'lljust steal those that money and theymight not know you have a passphrasewith the majority of your savings in itum so that's just something to keep inmindawesome do you want to cover off uh somesome common mistakesnext on the listyeah i think common mistakes is a goodspot to go nextuh so i've got quite a lengthy list hereandthe first one of which unfortunately iuhfell fell prey to a little bit um andthat is uh it comes back to our veryfirst pointof cape kycmultiple exchanges and without any realneed to really um so i've just uh sortof expose myself to you know put my nameon loads of different databasesand soit's an unfortunate one that you can'treally undo like we spoke about beforeand if you were to you know listen tothis podcast and decide that youumstill want to gofor a kyc exchange because you think youknow the task of going uh no care adviceandtry and limit your umyour exposure to this by just signing upwith one reputable exchange umi think that's a good one to start anddid youi think that's very good advice like ifyou are going to use a kyc service whereyou're providing your identityinformation you should choose itcarefully you should choose someone youtrust the mostand you shouldnot sign up for a lot of people justsign up for a ton of different servicesyou should only you should sign up forthe bare minimum ideally if you're gonnado it you sign up for oneyou use it solely just to buy bitcoinand then send it to your own walletsumand and you don't you don't use anyother additional kyc services you wantto limit that as much as possiblesecond thing is did you change your micsetup at all because it's way worse nowthan it was beforeuhhello i changed my computer um i'll havea player how much while you're talkingnow turn up is it just quietno we can hear you but it's just likebreaking up a little bit it's likecutting in and outall right i'll let i'll play aroundumanother common mistakeuhthat i see people make isi i mean gambling on coins so a lotof people will think that um bitcoin istoo expensive and i've missed the boatand i i'm too late to bitcoin umliterally every single person who hasentered bitcoin at any time in bitcoinhistory has thought they were too latethere's like a famous screenshot ofsomeone on one of the bitcoin forums uhlamenting that they didn't get in atfive cents and instead they got in at adollar and they were too late and theymissed the busum so everyone feels that wayuh you're not alone in that it'simportant to realize that you cantransact insmaller units of account we call themsatssoyou can you don't have to have a fullbitcoin you don't you don't you don'tneed like right now bitcoins at almost70 thousand dollars you don't need toput 70 000 and to use bitcoin uh satsare the smallest unit of bitcoin there'sa hundred million of themper bitcoin andright now sats you can get 1500 for adollar so you can send any amount ofsats you want to send you can send twodollars worth you can send 25 centsworthumit doesn't matter don't get caught up inin in thinking that bitcoin is tooexpensiveuhwhat common thing that these other coinswill dois they make it so they have so manyunitsthat it seems like it's cheaper than itis just to try and get you in the doorit's a it's a marketing tactic so justkeep that in mind uh q are you thereyeah how's my mic now oh so much betteri'm glad i brought it up perfect okay doyou have more common mistakesuh yeah common one um is just notpracticing umenough with transacting uh testing mybackups for my hardware walletstesting different wallets even usingtest net just practice practice practiceand getting comfortable uh using the thevarious tools that we've spoken aboutandgetting comfortable with it either usingtestnet which is basically uha copy a carbon copy of bitcoin that'shas that holds no value you can get itfor free onwebsites called faucets where you can goon and just mimic the normal behavior ofa walletand without the fear oflosing any real value and so you cansend some test net bitcoin to to your hardware wallet and youcan wipe it recover itand just to get really reallycomfortable with with that process sothatif um the worst was happening and yousomething was to happen to your houseuh where you say bitcoin wherever youstore your coin andyou're when you're in that packed stateit's not like the first time you touchyour hardware wallet for five yearsbecause you you know you've done thatyou know people call practice so you'vegot this lots of time if you send realvalue in there but it'sconnected to you and because you know ifyou're in a panic and you you need tomove your bitcoin quickly the last thingyou might be doing is doing itin unfamiliar uhsituation or in a familiarsituation wherebecause that's when mistakes happen andyou could uh muck something upyeah so we see that happen a lot whereyou know peopleuh so i actually don'tespecially for newcomers i don't know ifyou need to use testnetum it adds just anothercomplication to your processumbut but what happens a lot is likepeople will buy bitcoin they'll send itto a hardware wallet they never reallyuh get comfortable with itthen bitcoin goes up in valuesignificantly and like four years laterthey're trying to spend it and they'rejust not comfortable at allso you really want to get comfortablewith it you want to practice sendingreceiving backing up and restoring umand just you know i don't think testthat's necessary in that situationbecause you should just do it with thesmall amounts you knowuse you know send five dollars back andforthuh erase the wallet restore it from yourbackup see that your five dollars arestill thereum one nice thing about my earlierapproach that i mentioned if having twoof the same hardware walletis without putting funds at risk at allyou can load up one hardware wallet withsome bitcoinand then you can restore iton your second hardware wallet you canload up those secret words onto thathardware wallet and if your funds arethere and you can spend them then youknow you did the backup and restoreprocess correctly without actuallywiping the original wallet so that'sanotherbenefit you're basically verifying yourbackup and restore processyou don't want to be in a situationwhere you have a lot of moneyandyou have a lot of money on the line andyou've never done a backup you've neverhave you've never done a restoredprocess and you're just freaking out andmaybe you wrote down the words wrongi've had that happen to friends wherewe've had to guess the word that theythey wrote down wrong or wrote down inbad handwriting um so you don't youdon't want to be in that situation youwant to practice practice practicei think just to add to that uh backupprocess as well is thatmost of the umor the hardware wallets that we'vetalked about this evening havemultiple different types of backups aswell so i think it's worth noting thatpractice using both of them as well sowe've got the the siege words umboth call card and passport alsoofferingbackups as well where you can store itbackup onto a micro sd card um which is alittle bit easier to store and so iwould urge people to practice restoringfrom both methods as well becauseat the end of the day if again if in adoomsday scenario you don't know whichmethod of backup you're actually goingto have access to or which is survivedwhatever um you know doomsday scenariohas actually happened100um before we move on to more commonmistakes we have alex mccluskey in thechat asking about 401k ira fundsum if you're trying to hold bitcoin in aa in a in a tax beneficial way in yourretirement accounti would just keep this very simple uh ifyou do haveuh a 401k or an ira where you alreadyhave funds in it and you want to movethem into bitcoinjust consider using uh the serviceoffered by unchained capital that'sunchained.com disclosure they are asponsor of ofmy other show rabbit will recap thisshow does not have sponsorsumbut they're a sponsor becausethey're a good team it's a good productumi have friends there that are workingthere my buddy jeff andrew runs theirtheir retirement division and they willhold your handthey will help you through it obviouslyas we said earlier the caveat is you'retrusting them with your privacyum but pretty much in all situationswith retirement funds if you're using atax beneficial retirement uh methodyou're going to have to trust someonebecause it's all getting reported to thegovernment as wellthe nice thing about what unchained doesis you hold your own keys so you getthat tax benefit um but you're holdingyour own keys they can't spend yourfundsa lot of the other programs that are outthereumcan can spend your funds at will and youhave to trust them completely with thesecurity of your funds and your privacyso just something to keep in mindyeah the next one umfrom me is kind of a little bit moreoutside of the box umi lurked around on on bitcoin twitterand in some of the communities uh for alot longer than i really should have umwhen i started to uh interact with withpeople in the you knowwallet chat rooms or the no chat roomsand to use a few examplesmy knowledge grew exponentially fromthen onwards from having thoseinteractions versus me just sitting onthe sidelines and kind of you knowliking a few tweets every now and thenso if i was to go back and kind of havemy time again i i'd absolutely startgetting involved and start contributingand to the conversation much muchearlier because uh personally speakinganywaymy my knowledge just uh you knowskyrocketed compared to where i was justa couple of years ago and so big one forme that oneyeah that's uhand uh i just i think like learn bydoing right practice with small amountsumand get your feet wet rather than feelintimidated and feel like you have toread everything and listen to everythingand watch everything uhbefore you even get your feet wetyeah another one as well is and and mattmight roll his eyes at this one is iskind of going publicumthere there's a lot of value in instaying in the proverbial shadow so tospeak um i would urge people you knownot touh sort of start shouting from therooftops uh that they own bitcoin againbecause you know we talked earlier aboutkyc and how we kind ofcan paint a sort of red cross on yourback a little bit well shout from therooftops um when bitcoin hits anall-time high to all your friendsand might uh inadvertently do the samething one day um you know yeah 100 alittle bit jealous you never know he'sgoing to get jealous andtell somebody else you tell somebodyelse who'san individual that might want to try andget their hands on it soum i would be be candid about who youwho you speak to bitcoin about and it'sa bita double-edged sword that one because uhi think we've all got a little bit of apersonal responsibility to try and helpon on board others as well so um alsosay just kind of be selective about whoyou speak to it and what you sayyeah it is um it might sound a littlehypocritical coming for meum as aas as a as a public bitcoin figureumbutdefinitely in the beginning you shouldnotyou should you should not be talking youshould try and reduce how much you talkabout bitcoin don't make it obvious thatyou own bitcoin don't post on socialmediauh consider using a name like bitcoin qa does i mean it might surprise you buthe wasn't born with that namehe decided on that name himself for theinternet for his bitcoin workumin the future if you do want to becomemore public about ituhyou can do so in a moreresponsible wayum rather than doing it right in thebeginning you can never come back fromit once you do itum so it's something to keep in mindyou should never talk about your ownbitcoin you should never talk about yourown how much bitcoin you haveumthese are best practices uh you don'tyou don't uheven if it's a friend or a family memberit might seem like small amount todaybut in the futureuh it could be a large amount and theywill not forget it they tend to rememberone of the first questions mostfriends and family will ask you is howmuch bitcoin you own they love askingthat questiondo not answer it explain why you don'twant to answer it for themumif people do know you own bitcointhis is where that multi-sig setupreally shines because you can have itgeographically distributed you can haveyour keys in different locations um thatare far away from each other that makeyou getting compromised more difficulteven in a physical attack situation andobviously it is more ideal to live in aplace where you haveum proper gun rights and you can defendyourselfumso these are things to considerum if i was to do it againi probably would not be uh you know aspublic as i am about bitcoin um i made ajudgment calllater on in my bitcoin journey that ifelt we needed more public bitcoinfigures that were talking about realissues and specifically privacy um so imade that judgment call but there aresome mornings that i wake up and regretitumbut there are precautions you can takeand there are benefits though to beingsemi-public about your bitcoin usage uhmeeting people i've met some of the bestpeopleyou know i have i have basically i havefamily now that wouldn't exist otherwiseum but these are all things that youshould considerum as part of your bitcoin journey butin the beginningvery very very stronglywould sayyou know keep keep it as discreet aspossibleum you never knowyou knowyou you don't want to expose yourself toa malicious actor your government couldturn on bitcoina foreign government can use thatinformation against you uh if you'retraveling across a border or somethinglike thatso you you want to keep this in mindyeah the final um sign off one for me umwould beuhi just completely got out of my brainuh what is another two fa is another onea good one to touch on i think um yeswould be um if if you and it's just comeback into me now so i've got two tofinish off um if you again listen tothis podcast decide that no kosc is notfor you and you want to sign up for anexchange and a lot of these exchangeswill prompt you to use uh sms-basedtwo-factor authentication to um i'musing air quotes here to secure youraccountum this is where you'll get a textmessage to when you try and log into theto the exchange they'll send you a textmessage to authorize that login um therehave been multiple umuhinstances where this has beenexploited people have had theirinformation and their accounts hacked onthese exchangeswhich if youunfortunately have got funds on thataccountcan be withdrawn to whoever's got accessto your account they can withdraw it totheir own walletanda better alternative and would be to usean app-based uhtwo-factor authentication so an examplewould be umthere's one called anduh there's one called a edgiest uhthere's another one called um help meout here matt i've drawn a blank umuh did you say agesyeah i said aegis yep aegis is myfavoriteany app-based one and far more secureand there's been far f well aegis isopen source aegis is open source uhthat's a e g i s and the backup processis very easy you got to remember whenyou when you use these authenticatorapps umif your phone dies you want to make sureyou have a backup of themso yeah the most popular one is googleauthenticator and it's notlast i mean i haven't used it inmaybe six years or something like thatbut previously it wasn't easy to back upso make sure you're using one that iseasy to back upand back it up and keep multiple copiesyeah or the other alternative is you canget umlike a physical device that acts as yourthe second factor authentication lookslike a bit of a usb key that providesthe the additional authorizationbut less services tend to umoffer compatibility with those100umi i would say i think for most peoplethe physical device is overkillum can a sophisticated attackercompromise a phone base two factoruh yesum have we seen any widespread cases ofthat no do they still need your emailand your password yes umon that note you shouldn't be using thesame emails and the same passwords indifferent placesum if you go to haveibinpone.com you canput your email address in and it'll tellyou wheneveruh database gets leaked with your emailor your password or your personalinformation um so that's a veryimportant resource but but what we see alot of times is like there'll be like aleaklike maybe facebook will get hacked andthose emails and passwords will then beused at all the other services to tryand get into your accountum so that two-factor code gives you anadditional protection on top of that butyou really shouldbe trying to limit reuse of emailaddresses and never reuse passwords umyeahuh yeah there's one in the chat scoobysnacks asking is a password manager agood idea yes definitely would recommendit to anybody my personal favorite isis bit warden again another free andopen source uh software they do offer apaid version as well but the thefreemium uhoption is perf is perfectly good enoughfor for uh 99 of users i would sayyeah bit warden's great um you justgottaif you're using a password managerum there's some nuance there because ifyou're not self-hosting your passwordmanager you're using awhat's the main onelastpass people love lastpassumit's closed source you're kind ofputting all your eggs in one basketuhso there's some concern there you knowif you if you have all your passwords inthis password manager and that passwordmanager gets compromised then all ofyour accounts are compromisedumwhat i think is like a veryuh easy accessible thing forumnew users or people that are concernedis is your really important passwordsyou can just write them in a notebookyou write them in a notebooksomeone's going to need to get access tothat notebook physically in order tocompromise youumyou might not want to write it outcompletely clear you know maybe somethings you remember versus some thingsare on the paperyou can develop your own like kind ofcode system don't over complicate ityou'll probably forget the passwordum[Music]but uhpaper and pen paper and pen is a triedand true methodyeah absolutely and then just don't putit on athe final one that went out my headbefore um waswe've spoken about uh you know there's alot of information the past couple ofhours umdon't try and uh do everything in thespace of a week especially if you areliterally at step one um i would sort ofpick one of these topics you know wespoke about them in aumin a specific order for a reason and iwould urge people to sort of start fromstep one and try and master each stepbefore they move to the net before theymove on or at least not try to do toomany of them at the same timedepending on the approach depending onthe the approach that you take for thedifferent tools that we've we've spokenuh you know to do it properly and to doit justice and to understand it andpractice it like we've been like we'vebeen sort ofreiterating it's gonna take you you knowum a good bit of time you're gonna haveto dedicate some time to do this and tomaster some of these tools so trying todo too much too soon is setting yourselfup to to fail so take your time uh beum deliberate about it and and sort ofmaster something then move onyeah and our i that's great advice andas bitcoin q a said our order in thisepisode was intentionalso don't feel like you have to gothrough all the steps at once butgo throughthat order was how we we we chose thatorder specifically because we think it'sa very um[Music]efficient effectiveuh managing trade-offs and stuff balanceof what order you should kind of becoming into this um we also have someperson in the chatum who uses the nim some person so everytime i call him out in the chat i soundlike i'm just don't care about his nameuh asking for the best a two-factor appfor ios i really like authenticator plusfor ios users um i think it's availableon android as well but if you're onandroid i really just like aegisumso yeah there you go for that answerum i have on this list bitcoin q a ihave common questions do you have commonquestions that you have in mind orum i've got nothing noted down but kindof umoff the top of my headum a common one that i get is sort of uhis umis this setup good for me or is thiswallet the one i should useuhyou know insert service or or tool hereyou know is this goodum it's the thing with bitcoin and andusing the tools properly that we've beenspeaking about is thatwhat matter i might recommend from ourown personal experiencesmight not be perfectly applicable toyour own personal uh throat metal threatmodels or skill set um soagain we we have kind of covered thisground a little bit earlier but is umjust try things out um you know by i'mnot saying don't come to the people imatter myself and ask for advice youknow we're always um more than happy toto to help out um but the best thing todo is to sort ofget your hands dirty and try these toolsyou know you can do it for for free orfor a very low fees at the moment andjust testing out wallets or or differentdevicesor multi-sig setups if you want to gothat far coinjoin implementationsumbest thing to do is get your hands dirtyget get amongst the communities and youknow what's perfect for one person mightnot be perfect for another so umit's a bit of adyor do your own research and getcomfortable with what's going to workfor you really100 um just to reiterate umbitcoin q a has all of his guides atbitcoiner.guideumi have a list of resources and tools atcivildispatch.comhelpat the top of civildispatch.com help ihave also i have links toboth bitcoin q aummyselfand our buddy katan from australia whoruns ministry of nodes offers uhwe offer private one-on-ones and there'slinks to all of that at the top ofcivildispatch.comhelpum so if you dofeel that you you have the need for aone-on-one a specific time to jump on acallum that is available to you as well ihighly recommend both bitcoin q aand and katan uh for that and that's whythey are at the top of that pageumi thinkuh narwhal tacos has an interestingpoint i i kind of touched on it but ifelt like it was a little bit too earlyin the episode so i didn't go heavy intoitumhe's asking have you explained that noone actually holds their sats in a wallat just the key it took me a while towrap my head around thatthat is absolutely correctum you're not actually storing yourbitcoin you're storing the key thatallows you to access and spend yourbitcoin um so when we talk about allthese wallets when we talk abouthardware wallets and mobile wallets it'sreally uh either piece of software apiece of hardware that is that isstoring that secret key for you andallowing you to easily access that soyou can access your bitcoin um i thinkthat's an important point but i i do iwould say thatthat's almost more of ai don't know i i feel like it's more ofan advanced thingfor all intents and purposes you cankind of operate under the assumptionthat you're holding your bitcoin in thewallet butum it is a good it is a good point thankyou narwhal tacos um i think with allthat said it doesn't seem like we haveuh any any additional questions in thelive chat i would add that obviouslythis is still dispatch 43 there's been42 other episodes filled with contentum well that's a lot more advanced thanthis so if you want to dive into thatafter listening to this obviously feelfree to do that it's all available forfree without ads or sponsorsum q a you have any any additionalthoughts here before we wrap upi just want to reiterate just getamongst the communities use the toolsget your hands dirty don't be afraid totry things out um come to myself or mattfor any help and advice and just oneother you know we've mentioned katan umone of the prominent educator in thespaces uh btc sessions got a fantasticyoutube page that's got guy video guideson using literally everything to do withbitcoin so um if you're more of a visuallearner uh check out his youtube channelit's a fantastic resource as well 100that is also linked at civildispatch.comhelp or you can just search btc sessionson youtubeum i made him a channel on bitcointv.comi don't think he has uploaded anythingtherebut there's also a ton of great contentat bitcointv.com that is curated one ofthe issues and the pitfalls you shouldkeep in mind when you're on youtubeumespecially the high view count videosare filled withscams and bad advice um so you need tobe very careful uh you know if you'rewatching a btc sessions video it mightrecommend another video that looks likeit's reputable and that a lot of peoplehave watched and recommended ityou need to be very carefuluhat the end of the day bitcoin's aboutpersonal responsibilityumso no one's gonna be there if you loseyour bitcoin there's no getting it backuh and there'sthere's a lot of money to be made givingbad advice and showing bad productso you really really need to beskeptical all the timethink for yourself make your owndecisions and constantly keep learningand i want to be very clear herethat i'm not asking you to trust meeitheror bitcoin q a or catan or anything elsewe've mentioned in this video in thisvideo or any of the other civil dispatchepisodesyou need to constantlyfigure out things for yourself and makeyour own judgment calls if anyone'sasking you to trust thembe very very careful and just be verycareful in generalumbtc pins wants everyone all thenewcomers to know that they could buythey could buy merch from him atbtcpins.com so there you go btc pins

bitcoin onapple pay here's what he saidit's something that we're looking atit's not something we have uhimmediate plans to douhfori would sort of characterize it as thereare things that i wouldn't dolike umuh our our cash balancei wouldn't go invest that in crypto uhnot because i wouldn't invest my ownmoney in crypto but because i don'tthink people buy an apple stockto get exposure to cryptoand so if they want to do that they canthey can uhuhyou know invest directly in crypto orthrough other meansuh and so i wouldn't do thatand i'm i'm not planning to in theimmediate future to take crypto for ourproductsas a as a mean of tender uh but thereare other things that we're definitelylooking at like whatuh like i wouldn't want tohave anything to announce todaywell let me ask you a different questionbecause you just said that you might notdo it personallydo you own crypto in any bitcoin orethereum would you play around with thisi i do yeah i think it's reasonable toown it as a as a part of a diversifiedportfolio and i'm not giving anybodyinvestment advice by the wayso[Music]happy bitcoin tuesday freaks it's yourboy matt o'dell here for anothercitadel dispatch the interactive liveshow

namemy opinion is odell it's very easy torememberum so with all that saiduh we got a repeat guest here bitcoin qa good friend um and our plan is to tryand do an episodeuh have a conversation herewhere it's all encompassing from startto finish new new bitcoin are cominginto the space trying to do things youknow the right way trying to do thingsin a secure wayumand and just have it all in a singleepisode have it all in a singleconversationso as i was saying earlier the writerdies that are in the live chat um if youhave questions put your questions in ifif you're not a beginner and you'relistening in and you think we missedsomethinguh feel free to put that in the livechat as well and just a reminder thelive chat is accessible through thetwitter twitch and youtube streams andthey all getfed into uh the main chat so with allthat said i'd like to introduce bitcoinq a how's it going bitcoin q ahey matt it's going good thank you forhaving me back on uh it's been a while ithink um episode number two was now withthat with ergo so uh yeah lookingforward to getting back to it and uhrunning through some some of thebeginner-focused uh stuff that seems tobe missing from some of the podcasts uhfloating around me to tend to get jumpinto the weeds pretty quickly sometimesdon't we yeah i mean i have a feeling weare going to also be jumping into theweeds but we're going to try and do itin a nice constructive path into theweedsyeah i need you to keep me uh keep me incheck on that onebut yeah you are a dispatch lg it hasbeen it's been a minute and uh we'vewe've both been through a loti like to see like to think that we'vebeen through it together and uh yeahjust uhlove that you're back joining us and youknow i hope it's you know not just thesecond time it'll be many more times inthe futureumso with all that said freaks uh we havea bit of a structure that we set up forthis episode which is unusual fordispatch but i think it'll keep usmore focused um and so we're going tostart withactuallygetting bitcoin for the first timeum so do you want to you want to startwith that bitcoin q ayeah so uh it's buying bitcoinsnever been easier than it is todaythere's uh exchanges popping up all overthe place every every man in this dogseems to beuh giving you the opportunity to to beable to buy bitcoin from within theirecosystem or their appumthe the kind of elephant in the roomunfortunately and uh is is the um knowyour customer or kyc is it's uh it'slovingly called within the spaceumkyc is a regulation that essentially anysort of businessentity that has a banking relationshiphas to abide by that kind of dictates umthat they must collect certain pieces ofinformation from anybody that they givea service to obviouslyin the context of bitcoin that's anexchange that sells you bitcoin fordollars pounds yen whatever yourjurisdiction isumso in practice that looks like if youlike go on the cash app and you try andsign up to cash app to buy bitcointhey require you to upload your id youraddressuh i'm not sure some some servicesrequire like a selfie um that's whatwe're talking about right here which isthis identification information that'srequired when you sign up to one ofthese regulated servicesright and some of these are some ofthese exchanges now are even doing uhvideos where you they take that like a3d scan of your face which is kind ofscary really andso with all that said why why is thatkind of um why is that sort of a badthing that that people like matt andmyself sort of try andumwarm people away from or at least paintthe dangers clearly for everybodyeverybody um so when you supply thisinformation to to be able to buy bitcoinin a you know a really sort of easy andstress free way you know cash apps agood example where you can just in acouple of clicks get some bitcoin into awallet that you controlbut one of the main problems is that youknow all of this information getsrounded up into a centralized databasethat's controlled bythe entity that you're doing businesswithum unfortunately these entities or someof these entities they won't toureverybody with the same brush um don'thave a great track record of uh securingit effectively umtalk about perfect timing we we heardabout um a hack with uh robin hoodyesterday was it it was seven millionusersseven million users uminformation has been leaked um nowthere's varying degrees of the severityof the leak some of it's just emailaddresses uh some of it's more personalinformation like banking details etcumyou know to name a few others equifaxfacebook t-mobile clubhouse linkedinuh coinbase ledger um all of thosecompanies umrequiresome form ofof your personal information to to dobusiness with them and and they've allhad hacks where again with varyingdegrees of severity that um somebodythat shouldn't have got their hands onyour information did so i'm you knowwhat we're not talking small fry heresome of these uh hacks were in to thetune of millions and millions of ofpeopleum now you know if that's something likefacebook and your uh email address getsleaked you know it's not really the endof the world it might piss you off alittle bitwhen you tie that into umsomething like bitcoin wherehopefully especially after you'velistened to this podcast and you're sortof securing your own wealth that mightbe uh in your house that might be in aloved one's house or a combination ofthoseif uh if if the wrong person was to gethold of this information you know yourselfie your home addressum indicate in the case of coinbase howmuch bitcoin you've actually boughtthat is umessentially painting a very large crosson your front door that ummight make it inviting to the wrong typeof people to come and pay you a visit tosee if they can relieve you of of thosesatsso that's one of the main umyou knowuh reasons that that i personally tryand sort of make people aware that yesgoing on to cash app or coinbase orwhatever is is you know they make itreally really simple they've got reallynice polished uis to to be able to goand umget some get your hands on some statswithin it within a couple of clicks umit'syou know one of the big big risks isthat this information is leaked on aregular basis and there are companies inspace that to their credit and haveyou know they've nev never umbeen fallen prey to one of these attacksand but unfortunately they do seem to becoming um more and more uh frequent umso yeahthat's one of the main risks with kyc soyeah i mean i would add a couple thingshere uh first of all even if you know acompany hasn't been compromised yet weshould basically operate under theassumption that they will be compromisedin the futureumthis information once it is taken isoften soldto other people as wellit can be combined with otherinformation that was leaked from otherdatabases so for instanceumif you know you you have the facebookleak and the facebook leak has yourmailing address in it and then you havethe ledger leak and your ledger leak hasyour email address in it but thefacebook link also had your emailaddress in it they can combine those twouh leaks to get your full email addressand your actual in-person addresssecond of all we've seen umwe've seen physical attacks happen topeople who were known bitcoiners and howmuch bitcoin they had uh sometimes itwas because of these leaks it's hard totell for sure sometimes it's becausepeople just talk about their bitcoin andhow much bitcoin they own which you alsoshouldn't doumthird of alluhthis information can obviously be usedagainst you by your own government itcan also be used against you by foreigngovernments in the future obviously itis painting a target as you are someonewho owns bitcoin and uses bitcoin andexactly how much bitcoin you haveuh and then fourth of all in thecoinbase league specificallyumall of your withdrawal history was alsoleaked so uh it can be used to trackyour future bitcoin transactions uhbased on that information and we will gofurther in onon bitcoin privacy and trade-offs ofbitcoin when using bitcoin trying to useit privately how to go about that inlater on in this episode but these arejust things to keep in mindright so you know all of which is issort of incredibly scary um and theother thing final thing odds aboutbefore we sort of look onto thealternatives is that you know umsomething that i like to sort of keep inmind and remind people is you knowbeing here for number go up is great youknow i'm not going to sit here and saythat um i don't like to see us hitall-time highs all the time um butbitcoin is also umcreated to be able to make thetransactions that they don't want you tomakenowif you're sort of uh tying all of yourbitcoin to your personal identity umyou're you're kind of putting a inyour armor before you've even startedthat you know if you do want to makethose purchases that umbitcoin allows you to make um due to itspseudonymity thenyou're sort of starting two steps backby tying your your bitcoin holdings toyour personal identity um which is wheresort of buying from a new kyc source itcomes in so that you can have umsome or hopefully you know in a perfectsituation all of the bitcoin that youownso before we get there before we getthere just one more thingkycthese records are forever once once youdo these records you have to assumethey're foreverum is it best practice to delete anaccountum i you know if you're no longer usingit yes but you should assume that actualdatabase record hasn't been deleted umand it might be used against you in thefuture um so these are things to keep inmind umnow let's move to okay so if you'retrying to avoid kyc you don't want touse one of these regulated services whatare your optionsright so the the sort of uh two mostcommon ones that kind of get bannedaround in terms of actually purchasingbitcoin um is bisque uh which is apeer-to-peer uh decentralized exchangewhere you essentially it's a maker takermodel where somebody will want to umsell some bitcoin and they will go on tobisque and they'll say you know i wantto sell uh x amount of bitcoin for thismuch um you know 500 whatever and andthen you as a buyer can go on to thatsort of uh peer-to-peer marketplace andand look for these offers to see onethat sort of fits your bill that youknow was is within your price range andyou know the amount that you want to buyyou can go on completely and honestanonymously and and sort of take theirtheir sell offer so that you can buythat amount of bitcoin from themumthis isbisqyep so it's an application that you justdownload onto your computer basicallyyou run it all locally uh you knowthere's no personal information youdon't need to show any id's to sign upthe only person again depending on thepayment method that you use you knowthere's many many payment methods umsome are better from a privacyperspective than others and but let'ssay you knowmost people are going to go on and andif they want to sort of be able to takea wider range of offers from you knowmore people across the world they'regoing to want to use the banking systemwhich you know might ring some alarmbells to some other people listening butumwhat also i say is what's worse issharing your banking information withone person who is very likely to wantvery likely to be a privacy preservingindividual because they you know theyprobably wouldn't be using bisqueotherwise versus uh the regulatedentities that throw all of yourinformation into a centralized honey potthat we've just explainedum so that's one way you know some ofthe more private options that areavailable on bisc umare sort of postal money orders whichyou know i don't really know great dealabout um because it's a u.s centricthing um but you've also got cash in themailand then there's various various otheroptions that are kind of uh relevant totheir sort of jurisdictionsumanother option as well is huddle huddlewhich worksquite similarly to the way i've justdescribed with bisc and the thedifference being is a huddle huddle iskind of a centralized company um thathosts uh the sort of buy and sell uhlocations for you you know it's awebsite huddlehuddle.comum where you can go and sort of makeoffers or you can take offers again inthe same fashion umso so there may be some uh other alarmbells are in game where thinking whereum well what happens if i go on tobiscor to huddle hollow um and i youknow take this buy offer and i sendsomebody some some you know us dollarsand what's to stop them from just neversending me the bitcoin so both of theseservices um work on what's called anescrow system where the seller will haveto deposit the bitcoin first into amulti-sig wallet that is controlled byum by the buyer the seller and the sortof centralized entity um so thatbasically they theyuh can't sort of run off uh once they'veyou know got hold of your dollarsbecause they have to deposit the bitcoinfirst and and you'll be notified to waituntil you send any of the payments sothat they've proved that they've sort ofdepositedthe bitcoin into that um there is stillsome risk there but it's a reduced riskyeah absolutely you knowit's kind of i would say it's more of agrief and attack than ayou're not really at risk of losingfunds it's more of a um going throughthe arbitration process to prove thatyou've sent the dollars so that you getthe bitcoin back in the end so it'sgonna be more of a headache more than arisk to to actually lose any uhany cash would you sayyeah more or less umsoyeahcontinue so some of the other options umif youuh you can buy from bitcoin atmsthere's a really great website calledcoinatm radar.comwhere you can go on and punch punchingyour physical location i would recommenddoing sousing a vpnand and it will tell you all of thebitcoin etms thatare in your local area the the generalpremise of these is that you uh walk upyou can deposit some cashuh give it a um bitcoin address uhhopefully from a wallet that you controlwhich we're going to come on to laterand the bitcoin will be depositeddirectly into that wallet that youcontroluh there are again as is always the casewith bitcoins from caveats um justbecause you're depositing cash doesn'timmediately make bitcoin atm superprivate depending on the umthe brand of atm machine that you usesome of them do still ask for id um butthat is uh distinguished on the websitei've just said which is callingatmradar.comright some ask for id and thenand then some ask for just a phonenumber some ask for bothyeah which and obviously the the onesthat just ask for the phone number arethe better ones because you can spoofthat with services like textverified.comwhere you can just get kind of a burnernumber uh to satisfy the atm's umuh you know phone number requirementsbut obviously that's not tied to to yourpersonal identityum and then before we continue before wecontinue since we're still like early inthe episode and i should have mentionedin the beginning uh bitcoin q a has uhmy favorite guides in the space so ifyou want to look up somethingspecifically or if you prefer readingum if you go to bitcoiner.guidehe has all of his guides listed there sojust keep that in mind okay continueyeah pretty much everything that we'retalking about i've got some uhsome form of information on it um soyeah moving on to other noko i seeopportunities um so we've covered uhpeer-to-peer peer-to-peer exchangeswe've covered atms and the the next sortof option is to uh is to earn it umwhich might sound a bit outlandish tosome people are new and entering thespace but also we'll say is thatumeverybody has some form of a uniqueskill um and there's always going to besomebody who needs umwhat you can offer them uh it's justabout sort of uh trying to build up abit of a reputation whether that's inyour local area or online and so thatyou canyou knowsell your time or your skills andknowledge um and receive satsin in in repayment for themand the other option again probably notas much of a beginner optionas i would like it to be but the otheroption is to mine itumalthough home mining does seem to begoing through somewhat of a renaissancewhich is really really great to see andso the the general premise of that isthat you canbuy a bitcoin miner you can plug thatinto your um outlet at home plug in anethernet port connect up to to a miningpool and stream yourself somesecret sats or some private no kyc satsuh directly again into your wallet thatyou control umthere's been you know a fair bit of foodbanded around that home mining is iskind oftoo difficult or it's too expensive umthe the thing i would say is that yeahit's very much dependent on yourelectricity prices um but again you knowthis this shows fairly us centric andthere's a lot of places in the u.s whereyou know and if you'reum earning anywhere less than i thinkyou knownails in the chat they'll probablycorrect me on this but i think you'reprofitable mine at the moment anywherebelow 30 sats 30 shots yeah so i meanwith with all of these techniques youmight be spending a little bit moremoney than you would beum if you went through one of theseregulated services um you'rethe way i justify it is i mean you'reyou're paying a little bit of a premiumfor privacyand you're paying that for privacy goingforward too so it keeps paying dividendsuh with mining specifically mining homemining is a fantastic wayuh in my opinion ofaccumulating kyc free setsumit's really nice because once you haveit plugged in it's just constantly goingyou don't even have to really thinkabout it just constantly bringing inmore sets um we already have two wholemining umcivil dispatches so if you go back ifyou go to civildispatch.comor if you go through the podcast feed orif you go to bitcointv.com and ourplaylist over there you can find thoseepisodes and we're about to have a thirdone too uhi think november 30th there's gonna be athird home mining episode so if that'ssomething that interests you you shouldgo check those out uh starting with thefirst one uh because we literally spentlike three hours on all the differenttrade-offs thereyeah just to come back on on somethingthat you said about um generallyspeaking you're absolutely right thatyou're gonna pay uma little bit more for uh noko ac satsyou know especially if you go to thepeer-to-peer exchangesum but i just i like to try and reframeit and you know it's not a a no kycpremium and the theprice that you see on a kyc exchange ilike to call it the um the discount thatyou get given um for giving up yourpersonal information and puttingyourself uh a little bit more at riskthan versus uh getting some sats thatare not tied to your identity so i thinkthat's like that useful framing yeah thereal price is the private way and thenexactly discount if you sacrifice yourprivacyum and then one method that you didn'tmention which isprobably the most uh accessible to newcoinersis if you have a friend or a couplefriends that are interested in bitcoinand they've been in bitcoin for a whileum obviously if you can if you can paythem cash for some of their bitcoinum that is the most private uhi wouldn't say the most private but it'sdefinitely the most accessible privateway for a new coinerand if they if they don't want to sellyou any they might know someone whowants to sell some soum that's always something to keep inmind cashin person isextremely gives you very good privacyguarantees periodumwhat else also like if you knowto the to the bitcoiners out therelistening to this uh showum you know guide your new cornerfriends in throughthat kind of method right and whether ornot you want to actually explicitly sellit to them that's one thing butyou know if you if you go out to dinnerhave them pay for dinner with their withtheir cash or their credit card and thenpay them back in bitcoin orgive them you know birthday gifts inbitcoin and like get them started in apeer-to-peer fashion rather than justthrowing them to the wolves and sendingthem to a regulated exchangeyeah there's a couple of people in thechat that have just uh rightfullyshouted out um as techo vouchers as welland which is essentially uh you'll getsort of stores uh that sort of sign upto become an azteco um sort of vendorand you can go in hand over some cashand you'll get sort of a voucher whereyou can go and claim the the equivalentamount of sats from that again directlyinto a wallet that you controlthe the the other caveat the sorry theonly caveat with azteco is that thethe sort of uh kyc responsibility if anyis put onto the specific vendor so itwon't just be you know don't justpresume that because there's an articleum vendor near you that it won't be nokyc uh each one is sort ofuh left to kind ofcome up with the their owninterpretation of whether they need todo it or not basicallyand you have that major chain in you inthe uk that's an azteca vendor rightwhat's the name of thatit was poundland but then it stopped acouple of months ago and it's showing nosigns of coming back unfortunately uhokay so as they realized what was goingon they're like ah we can't too muchliabilitywhich was a shame because they they havea store in literally every town therewas hundreds of them and it was massivefor the uk but yeah unfortunate to knowmore okay well that's a shame um if youwant toread more aboutthe dangers of kyc you can go to bitcoinq a's website no kyc only dot comumhowever you decide to proceed withobtaining bitcoin and accumulatingbitcoinum the next step istrying to secure it uhsecure it well and secure it in a waythat you don't have to trust a thirdparty uh who can seize your fundsum so how shouldhow should bitcoiners how should newcoiners go about that bitcoin q awhat are their optionsthe natural uh first step for mostpeople unfortunately like we've justsaid is is um a centralized exchangeagain like coinbase cash app or someonesomething like thatwhere you will go on deposit dollars oryour local currency they will uh sort ofcredit your account with you know theequivalent amount of statswhat you have there is um an iouwhere you've got an account with themwhere they say that you've got this muchbitcoin essentially what you actuallyhave in real terms is uh well it's aniou and you don't actually hold anybitcointhe the sort of uh very essence ofbitcoin is the uh that you know thatgoes to say you're not your keys notyour coins which is banded around a hellof a lot and for good reason and itessentially means that if you're notholding the keys for your bitcoin uh youdon't actually have any bitcoinso you bought someone in exchange um thethe next step would be to get yourselfum a mobile walletwhere you can uh generate the keys uhwithin that wallet um so that your youand only you are in control of uh any ofthe bitcoin that you send to that walletum so before we before we move on andi'm sorry that i keep cutting you off ii hope i hope it's uh fine with youbefore you move on umso so the risk is if you're holding itif you're holding it in one of thesecustodial wallets which is what theexchanges default toum and there's some other services thatalso are custodial walletsumbasically the telltale sign of that isthe way you access it is through ausername and passwordumyou don't have any backup yourself whathappens there is there's a highlikelihood that your account could getfrozen we've seen that with paypal inthe past with fiat with just us dollarswhere paypal will freeze your accountand you're not able to get your moneyum it could be stolen if the exchangegets compromised or the custodial walletgets compromisedum and obviously you're trusting yourprivacy completely with the custodianbecause they know all of yourtransactions and your current balancesso it's not idealum and you want to learn how to holdbitcoin yourself becauseone of the revolutionary things aboutbitcoin is that you can hold it yourselfin a way thatumsomeone has to physically compromise youuh to to take your bitcoinum soi guess you're about to start withmobile wallets i think mobile walletsare the most accessible way getting awallet on your phone basicallyum to hold your bitcoin for you rightyeah just before i get down to themobile wallet it comes back to the pointi made earlier about censorshipresistant or being able to make thepayments thatum you know you want to make not thatthey give you permission to to make umif you've got to uh ask for permissionfrom an exchange to be able to sendbitcoin to your desired destination umyou know you're asking for permissionand you know that's not why we're herewe want to be able to spend our money towhoever we want whenever we want sofirst step and the easiest step is toget a phone wallet you know they're freethey're easy to access you know you candownload from any popular app store orquite a lot of them offer umdirect downloads so that you canuh download from the the you know thechosen teams umwebsite or or github umthe a lot of people tend to rush in andtry and buy um you know the next besthardware wallet straight away whenthey've just bought sort of 100 ofbitcoin to dip their toes in a littlebitwell if you you know if you're justdipping your toes in to see if thisthing's uh working for you then itdoesn't make any sense to you know goout and buy a hardware wallet and thisis coming for somebody who works for ahardware wallet company um it doesn'tmake any sense to go out rush out andbuy acouple hundred dollars on a hardwarewallet when you own less than that inbitcoin so that's why you already have aperfectly good phone that you carryaround with you it's very easy to spendand receive fromum but the important thing here is thatyou use a reputable mobile walletthere's a lot of scammy mobile walletsdon't just open up the app store andsearch for bitcoin wallet you will get alot of bad options thereyeah the the unfortunately the the top10 um results for that sort of search inmost of the app stores are quite abysmalmy personal recommendations would besamurai wallet if you're an android useruh or blue wallet or if you're an iosuser uh moon wallet is also another onethat i know you're pretty bullish onthat as well yeah both blue wallet andmoon wallet that's with 2us m-u-u-n areavailable on both android and iosumthey'rethey're very easy to use for beginnersuh i i would say they're not veryintimidating umso don't be intimidated you shoulddownload one just try itso the the kind of general premise ofthese and unfortunately i mentioned moonwallet there it's gonna umit's gonna book the trend of what i'mabout to say but the general premise isyou'll download the app from your chosenlocation uh the the app when you set upa new wallet the app will show you alist of 12 or 24 words which is yourmaster secret um you know which is thethe master backup to your to yourbitcoin wallet anybody that gets theirhands on that and be that physically ordigitally um is going to be able to takeall of your fundsso make sure that you write that downand secure it somewhere um safe andthenso moon wallet has a different backupmethod um it'll prompt you and explainhow to back up that butwe will focus on this standard which issomething we call seed words which isthey're basically these wordsit's a phraseand the wallet generates it for you andyou need to keep them secret youabsolutely need to keep them secret soyou don't want to put them on aninternet connected device you put themon you don't want to like save them inyour icloud notes folder you don't wantto take a screenshot and upload it toicloud what you want to do is at thebare minimum you want to write it downon a piece of paper double check thatyou wrote it down correctly store itsomewhere securely because if someonegets access to it they have access toyour funds but as long as you have thosewordsyour phone you could drop your phone inthe toilet it could fall you know itcould fall and crack and break or justcompletely justyou know some phones just like stopworking sometimesas long as you have those seed words youcan reinstall the app on a new deviceand just put in those words put in thatphrase words and you will have access toyour fundsyeah and the beauty of that is like yousaid most of the you know 99 of thewallets umin the space all sort of work to thatsame standard so you know you wouldn'tnecessarily have to even uhdownload the exact same mobile wallet aslong as the mobile wallet that youchoose umit abides by the rules which again mostof them do then you can sort of put thatseed phrase into into any other walletand there's a quick question in the chatwhich i think is probably good to touchon before we move on to hardware walletsandsomebody asked how much would you needto own to get a hardware walletnow obviously i'm not going to be ableto answer that for the for everybodythat that's watching you know it's quitean individual questionand all i would say is you knowif it's yourthe only mobile wallet you've gottenit's on your daily phone i would use theequivalent of how much cash would youphysical cash would you carry aroundwith you um you know what's your limitat which it's gonna start um affectingyour life if you used to lose thatbalance umthe quick review the mobile wallet themobile wallet should be like almostconsideredis is like your spending wallet what youwould have right inin in your back pocket but uhgoing further when we go into moremethods of storing your bitcoin thatwould be more like a savings accountum except i you're about to say a caveatuh i mean i have my own caveat i wouldsayi thinkespecially if you're using a reputableonei think people can feel a little bitmore comfortable than the kind of amountof cash they would carry in their pocketum i know like i wouldn't feel morecomfortable i wouldn't feel thatcomfortable carrying more than like 400in my pocketum but like a mobile wallet especiallyif it's your first wallet you're justgetting started you're gettingcomfortable you have your seed wordsbacked upuh your phone's up to dateyou know we don't seehacks are theoretically possibleobviously phones get compromised all thetimeumbut i i would probably if i had to picka number i'd like being like the 5 000to 10 000 rangelike that's where you start having toreallyconsider securing it moreum and you should also operate under theassumption because bitcoin tends togo up fastumyou should be prepared ahead of timebecause it could beyou know it could be a thousand dollarsin there and then in six months it couldbe worth eight thousand dollarsyeah the the other thing i would say aswell is that thisalmost everybody has got a spare phonelying around at the house that you knowyou could use that as your sort ofdedicated bitcoin phone and where youcouldbe slightly more comfortable storing youknow maybe larger amountsrelative to the individual and and thenyou could kind of decant off into yoursort of daily phone what you might wantto spend on a day-to-day basisabsolutely nothing wrong with thatapproach as well if you didn't want toand shell out quickly for for umfor a hardware wallet which we can wecan come on to now and so hardwarewallet is well before we get to hardwarewallets you also havethere's also software wallets on on thecomputer that you can haveright so you have mobile wallets youhave software wallets on your computerwhere it's like you install an app onyour computerumi i mean i would saylike unless you're an advanced user andyou have like a dedicated computer andthis episode isn't for advanced usersthey should probably shy away from thatin the beginning i i think the mobilesecurity model is a stronger securitymodel as you know as long as you're notworried about like the nsa or somethingum or like the chinese intelligenceservicesor these intelligence services um mostmost of the population uh are not greatat securing their their computer uh mostpeople's computers are unless you'resort ofa bit of a hacker man there's this youknow a far more vulnerable device thanyour mobile phone iswhich is why like you said you know icompletely agree that i don't recommendthem especially for larger amounts umand i tend to sort of skip straight tothe hardware wallet after the mobilewallet stageumsohardware wallets um are essentially adedicated uh physical deviceum designed to manage the the keys thatcontrol your bitcoin um so with thembeing a a physical dedicated device youknow their one purpose is to secure yourbitcoin whereas your phone hasyou know it's essentially a computer inyour pocket and with all of that extrafunctionality that your phone hascompared to a hardware walletincreases the theoretical attack vectorswhere hackers orthe nsa whoever can umsort of try and attempt to get theirhands on your bitcoin so these devicesare very focused andthey're focused at securing your bitcoinfrom physical attack um and also uh fromum digital attack ie uh you knowsomebody stealing your keys um over theinternet if you were to connect one ofthese devices to your uhvery likely highly insecure computerumso they a lot of them most of the goodones um work uh you know that theirprimary umway of of sort of keeping things secureis that they operate with what's knownas an air gap where they they canoperate without being connectedphysically to to any other device andbecauseit's that physical umconnection that sometimes can introduceuh uh intro um extrathreat factors so the the idea just todistill it here like the idea of ahardware wallet is that you have aa device that's builtto securely hold your bitcoin welltechnically it's holding the keys toyour bitcoinum butfor all intents and purposes it's it'syou can think of it as holding yourbitcoin and and it interacts with eitheryour computer or your phone in a waythat those keysall the keys are what protect yourbitcoin gives you access to bitcoin andyou don't want someone else to haveaccess to those keys it keeps those keysoff that computer or off that phone soit stays on the deviceand that device is never connected tothe internet sothethe basic concept behind securingyour stash with a hardware wallet isthatuh for someone to compromise you theyneed to physically have access to youand the device orif they can compromise the device justthe device but they like have to comeinto your home or come into your officeand get that device rather than hackingyou through the internetright and you know the even um if ageneric attacker was togain physical access to to most of thesedevices and they're still going to um afair bit of time and a hell of a lot ofequipment to be able to um you knowcrack theum protections on the device to be abletoaccess the keys um and to be able tosteal your bitcoin so it's not just acase of umprotecting you from a malware infestedcomputer um if somebody was to break inthere's still pin protection on thedevice and so it's not just a case ifyou lose the device um and you loseaccess to your bitcoin again the thepremise that matt spoke about beforeabout writing down your seed words um isexactly the same with a hardware walletuh the differences here is that um thethe when you sort of uh generate thosethose 24 or 12 words and it's done in anoffline environment that's never beenconnected to the internet so that againit just removes that extra threat vectorwhere um you're not connected to anysort ofinternet connected devices so it's justthat extra layer or wrapper of securityperfectumshould wewhat is your favorite hardware walleti saw that one coming a mile offum so full disclosure um i work for a umhardware wallet manufacturer calledfoundation devicesand obvious biases aside i genuinelybelieve that we make the umthe best option for a beginner enteringthe space umit's incredibly secure but also veryeasy to operate uh so i should havenamed the devices called passport andand another great device is the callcard umwhich is probably looks a little bitscarier to the newcomer i would say umbut has some extra features um thatmight bemore beneficial for more advanced usersthat they could sort of leverage sothose would be my two favorites yeah iwould say my favorite is uh cold cardumi've used multiple versions of coldcards i highly recommend them umand then ifwe're not really going to go intocoins here but if youabsolutely need to gamble onother coins in the space rather thanjust bitcoin uh both foundation and coldcard are bitcoin onlyumi mean so i i would say either use aledger or a treasureuh hardware wallet if if you wantcoin support um but even in thatsituation you probably shouldgo with a bitcoin only hardware walletfor your bitcoin and then use the otherones for your coins and just likethe mobile wallets there are lots ofreally bad harder wallets out thereso don't just googlebest hardware wallet because a lot ofinfluencers are paidtopromote them so you'll see youtubevideos with 500 000 views saying to usea horrible hardware wallet soconsider thatyeah what i would say just to back thatup again is that you know likelihood isif you're listening to this that you'reat least aware um ofyou know bitcoin twitter and the peoplethat are umaround and popular on there and most ofthose people have been around for a goodnumber of years and they've probablytried all of these devices so look towhat most most of theirmost of those people are using or atleast recommended and when you're sortof doing your own research to see whichdevice is going to be best for youperfectumwhen they're using their hardware walletthey need to use it with awith software they need to use it withan appso what are your recommendations forwhich apps they should use with theirhardware walletthe best two for meif you want to stay on desktop whichgenerally gives you sort of a little bitmore extra functionality would be numberone be spiral wallet um hands down myfavorite umor if you like a little bit of a sort ofeasier to to operate interface with kindof lessadvanced features spectre desktop isalso a great onetwo great recommendations spectre usedto be my favorite now sparrow's myfavoriteyeah um whichmight uh be a good segue for what we'vegot coming up next uh well before we getthereyou can also useyou can also use both the cold card andthe foundation passport with blue walleton mobile so if youare going through the steps and you gotcomfortable with blue wallet alreadyum because you started with a mobilewallet uh you can then use blue walletwith both of those hardware walletswhich is nice especially i mean i ithink some people listening to thisprobably don't have a computer that'sso a lot of people don't have computersthey just have the computer in theirpocketyeah you know we're heading towards amobile first world aren't we if not ifwe're not already there and blue walletdoesoffer a great interface uh especially uhwith with the with the passport with theqr interfaces uh very very slick andvery easy to wrap your head around as abeginnerawesome okay so you want to go to thenext topicyou said yeah let'slet's hit nodes yeah so i talked aboutum inspector desktop and one of thegreat features about like the desktop isit actually has a built-in bitcoin nodeso uh the next step along your journeyuh hopefully will be to look to run yourown bitcoin nodeum a bitcoin node is you can look at itas your umsort of interface into your into thebitcoin world and it's going to be thatnext step along the sovereignty journeyso that you can and again one of the thebuzz phrases that you hear in the spaceis verify your own transactionsand so when you receive uh any bitcointransactionand that will bebeing passed to you via a whole networkof nodesand the wallet that you choose to usewill be connected to a node now thatnode could be uma centralized node or operated by anexchange uh it could bea node that you don't know who existsthat might actually be a chainsurveillance company or hopefully itcould be your own node that you can runum in your house relatively cheaplynow the benefits of of running your ownnode like i said is you can verify yourown transactions so that you can be surewhen somebody's sending you atransaction and that the transactionabides bythe this sort of rule set umthat the the network that you've chosento join umthat we all agree on uh to put that alittle bit simplea little bit simpler is that you canbe sure that sort of nobody's trying tocheat you and send you some fake bitcoinor a transaction that's not valid and sothat you know you might be selling goodsor services and they might be paying youin bitcoin for thatandand if you weren't verifying your owntransactions they might be able to umsend you um the way i like to frame itis it's using your own note to interactwith the bitcoin network you have to usea node and if you don't use your ownnodeumyou don't have counterfeit detection isis like kind of how i like to view itsomeone can kind of trick youuh into it into thinking you havebitcoin when you don't have bitcoin soyou want to use your own node for thatpurpose and then second of all which ithink is almost more tangible to peoplebecause to be honest uh we haven't seenthat's more of a theoretical attack andwe haven't really seen it play out itcould still play out in the future youshould assume it it will so you want touse your own node for counterfeitdetection but second of all it alsoif you don't use your own node um you'retrusting your privacy with whoever'snode you're using so you want to useyour own node so that you don't have totrusta potential potentially a stranger or acompanywith that that private transactioninformation and balance informationyeah it's about removing trustessentially and and by running your ownnode you're you're putting the trust inthe hardware and or the the softwarethat you are choosing to run uh not theone that's kind of been given to you ifyou're operating with an exchange or acentralized node runner and so there'suma a massive awash of choice and withvarying degrees oftechnical abilitythe the easiest way to get running withyour own nodeis to download a piece of softwarecalled bitcoin corethis is kind of the the sort of uh defacto software built by the the bitcoincore developers uh that is essentially apiece of software that you can in acouple of clicks download onto yourlaptop or desktop and and it will startto download the your own copy of theblockchain so that you can umtransact with the built-in wallet andto just to get started and verify yourown transaction that way that'sabsolutely the easiest way and as itouched on earlier uh spectre desktopactually has umessentially that built in as well justpackaged in a slightly different way foryou and so they're they're absolutelyfree and within a couple of clicksyou'll be on the way to downloading yourown copy of the blockchain and havingyour own node set upthe problem with a setup like that isthat umyou i can't really um generally speakingconnect any mobile wallets to it so ifyou were to want to transact when you'reout and about and you run bitcoin coreon your laptopand you wanted to send the transactionthe likelihood is you're not gonna haveyour laptop with you so you you know youwon't be able to to spend as easily assome of the node options that we'regoing to come up come on to uh in asecond i'll just pause see if matt's gotanything to add thereumyeah so i mean if you're using bitcoincore or if you're using the built-inbitcoin core inspectoruh yeah correct your you can't the mainnegative is you can't use it with themobile wallet the also the othernegative isum your transaction and balance infowill be on your computer so if it'sa computer you use for work or acomputer you use uhto play games or look at porn orsomething like that your social mediahabitit might be easily compromised and thatbecomes a it becomes mostly it becomes aprivacy issueumbecause all your transaction historywill be there and all of your balancehistory will be thereum but also you can't use it with mobilewallets which is a key component as wellyeah so so the next best option um andunfortunately the most expensive optionis what's known as a plug and play nodeso this is where you'll buyessentially a small box from one of thevarious teamsto name a few we've got uh ronin dojowe've got raspi blitz we've got startnine uh umbrell there's loads ofdifferent companies or my nodeno nothere's loads popping up um all withdifferent feature sets but essentiallythey sell your boxuh that you plug in at home you plug itinto your router you plug it into thepower outletand then within a couple of clicksyou're off and running again to to getyour own copy of the blockchain and haveyour no your own node up and runningand before we move on uh civil dispatchuhcivil dispatch 26i had all the major node teams on for aconversation ontheir node projects so if you'reinterested in having one of thesepurpose-built boxes or you a lot ofthose projects that were just namedallow you to actually buy the hardwareseparatelyand then install their software on it umconsider listening to that sill dispatchright so and the the kind of finaloption is the diy approach like matt'sjust touched on where all of theprojects that we just said and we'llhave a parts list you can go away andbuyspend a couple hundred dollars buying ahard drive and a single board computerand a couple of other cablesand build your own node and put your ownsoftware well put the software thatthese teams provideand onto that hardware uh the the endresult is that you get um the same nodewith all the same features um obviouslythe caveat is that you've got to gothrough the process of buying thehardware yourself flashing the softwareand onto a micro sd card uh which mightcause you some you know if you're a lesstechnical user and you're lesscomfortable with taking that approachand that's why the teams offer theplug-and-play note it does sound moreintimidating than it actually isand i would absolutelyso like i encourage new users to gettheir feet wet um also juston thejust to go back a little bit aboutbitcoin core i mean if you're using youcan use you can also use bitcoin core ifyou're running bitcoin core on the samecomputer you're running spectre on or asparrow they both can connect to itumif you do that process you really shouldbe using it on a dedicated computer iknow i like kind of touched on thatearlier when i said you know if you'reusing it for playing games or socialmediait could get compromised easier becauseyou're using it for all these othergeneral purposes you're downloadingsoftware on it that maybe you haven'tverified you definitely haven't verifiedand have no idea what's really runningthereum so if you are going to go thatapproachyou should have a dedicated device youshould consider a dedicated computer adedicated phone that you are using withit um and uhyeah in general dedicated devices areare going to be more secure and moreprivate you'rewhen we when we talk about security andbitcoin land whereyou don't don't let perfect be the enemyof good don't get overwhelmed becauseyour setup's not perfect but at the sametime you're just trying toreduce your threats so that you're notthe lowest hanging fruit most of thetime when we see these hacks it'stargeted at the people that are mostvulnerableyeah and the just to go back to the diyapproach that was outlining umall of these uh different projects thatwe've spoken about have got reallyreally good documentation and quitevibrant communities as well uh ontwitter telegram or their own dedicatedforum and so don't be afraid to you knowgo and have a browser the documentationlike matt said it's not actually asscary as i made it sound um and also youknow go and ask some questions in the inthe telegram chat or in the slack orwhatever you know um chat room that thethe the project has gotum you'll probably find or you'lldefinitely find thatall of these the people that are inthese communities are really welcomingand they've definitely been in yourposition before now and and you knowthey they found uh the thought of thisreally scary a couple of years ago andyou know now they might be runningseveral diy notes so they'll be don't beoff-put by it100um i will echo that sentiment i wouldjust add a slight caveat that there arescammers in these telegram groups andthese chat rooms um they will often tryand impersonateuhpeople that are involved with theproject or other notable figures to tryand get you feel comfortable never nevergive anybody uh your seed words thosesecret backup boards never give themtheir secret backup boardsand you know always be skeptical ifsomeone in one of those groups tries todm you separately and tries to go into aprivate chat you know sometimes it islegit but you need to be extra cautiousin that type of situationyeah and and if somebody does don't beafraid to ask in in the sort of mainroom you know tag the person who youthink might have dmd you and said isthat his issue at the mme exactly butalways uh just act on the the on air onthe side of caution and and keep thatsort of adversarial mindset to think youknow why is this person reaching out tome completely out of the blue after ijust asked my first question enteringthe room100um so all those node projectssupport something called electrum serverand electrum server is a standardumit's it's a standard way to interactwith your own node um you can use thoseelectrum server details and then you canput them into sparrowyou can put them into many of the mobilewallets that we mentioned earlier youcan put them into blue walletwith samurai specificallythey don't use electrum server they usesomething calleddojoand with that pairing is as simple asthere's a qr code and you just scan theqr code with your samurai wallet on yourphone and it'll pair up with your nodeyeah the good thing is with dojo as wellis it's uh implemented in the vastmajority of the the note packages nowthere's there's more that have dojo thatthen don't which is really great to seeindeedshould we hit on the coin joinokay soi i just want you know we're we're anhour inum if you're a newcomer you just listento this hour and you're intimidated as uh don't be intimidated you knowstart with step one where we talkedabout acquiring your bitcoinumthen you know learn how to hold your ownkeys and slowly move through the processdon't you know freak yourself out thatyou know now now i gotta run a node toolike i'm now i'm really intimidated youknow step by step get your feet wet getcomfortable send transactions receivetransactions back up your wallet restoreyour wallet just get comfortable with itget used to it don't it's not somethingto be scared of it's something that youlearn by doingyeah i uh i put a tweet a couple ofweeks ago actually that kind of echoesthat that you know if uh sending atransaction uh makes you feel a littlebit uneasy then you haven't sent enoughtransactions um you can see on screenthere that the mempool is uh you knowit's a little bit busy than what it wasbut a couple of sats per bite is goingto get your transaction confirmed veryquickly and that's going to cost you youknow less than a dollar to send atransaction so we don't have we don'thave that on the list but before we moveon to coin join on chain privacyutxo management we should probablyhow does how does a newcomer choose whatfee to pay they open up their walletthey go to send a transactionumwhat like how do bitcoin transactionfees work i feel like that is somethingwe tend to gloss overyeah we overlooked that one um wellfortunately most of the the good mobilewallets especially the ones that we'veuh mentioned uh on tonight's stream uhwill give you a couple of options uhwhere you canum you'll they'll either have you knowthree options sort of low prioritymedium priority and high priority likeagain like we can see on screen or theremight be a slider where you can manuallyadjust the feeand essentially the the higher that thefee you pay the more likely that uh yourtransaction is going to be uh confirmedor processed quickeruh againa caveat with that one we've got a lotof caveats tonight is that umthe uh some of the estimation the feeestimations umthese wallets all use different sort ofalgorithms as to how they um calculateor estimate the fee that would berequired to get you confirmed in thedisplayed priorityso matt's got on screen here a reallygreatwebsite called mempool.spaceum which can it shows you again the thepriority uh fee selections uh or what itwould adviseand based on uh correct me from wronggame map but based on what's currentlyin the mempool um as well as sort ofhistorical data as well so it's kind ofaalways a really good sort of accuratelook at you know if you want to get yourtransaction processed within the nextblock uh right now it would take anestimate of 13 sats per byte um butagain there's a little caveat here thatthere's still umtransactions with much lower transactionfees umthan 13 sats per byte that will also getget confirmed so it's kind of umit's not an exact science uh i will saythatbut multiple sources is always a goodone if you want to try and uhget it sort of nailed so i mean bitcoinis a run by a companybitcoin is adistributed networkum and so as a result how bitcointransactions workiswe have this chain of transactionsand the transactions are within blockswe call them blocksumroughly every 10 minutes there'll be anew bitcoin block and it will havefinalized transactions included in thatblockuntil you get into a blockyou sit in a waiting list that waitinglistis we call that the mempool we call itamenpool technically every node hastheir own mempoolumbut if your internet connection is solidin most situations those mempools shouldall look the same so when you go tomempool.space you're looking at theirmempool that will look very similar toif you looked at the same thing on yourown node which a lot of these nodeprojects by the way allow you to runmempool.space natively with your ownnodesothebasically you have this like free marketthat's constantly going on where you'redecide wherepeople are choosing which fee they'rewilling to spend and miners are going tousuallyinclude you in a block based on yourorder in that waiting list based on howmuch you want to spendso if it's a transaction between someoneyou trust um and you're willing to waita longer period of time you can pay alower fee if you're sending just toyourself you can pay the lowest fee wecall that's one sap per byte is thelowest fee because you're just sendingit to yourselfum you know if if in some crazysituation where a one sapper by nevergets confirmed ever which we've neverbeen through you can always resend thattransactionso you're gonna want touh choose your transaction fee based onthe urgency you want that transactionfinalized on the networkand most good wallets will basicallygive you a low medium and highyou knowthislow being i can wait medium being likei'm in the middle ground because it'smedium and high being i don't want towait i want it finalized as soon aspossibleyeah andit'sit's a very much a dynamic thing it'slike a queue that's always evolvingevery single second because there's moreand more transactions being sent youknow every second andumit's not within you know outside therealms of possibility thatwhat the fee that you put up right thissecondmight not be enough to get youimmediately uh processed into the nextblock in sort of five minutes timeum so it's it's very very dynamic andyou know that's why i said it's not sortof an exact science so generallyspeaking for most people the walletestimators are pretty good especially ifit's an urgent transaction that you needto be processedimmediately100 i'm glad we covered that topicum also uhjust uh before we move on to the nexttopic just to jump backwith hardware wallets uhyou know the backup to that hardwarewallet are those words you wrote downumyou have the option of putting them intosteel these steel plates are availablemany different vendors offer the steelplatesand the idea there is if you put it intosteel obviously it's going to be waterresistant and fire resistant it's goingto be more sturdy than paperyou might also consider makingduplicates of those seed words andhaving them in different places so likeif your office burns down or your houseburns down it's still in the otherlocationwith the caveat that it meansit could be more likely that someoneelse finds it because it's in morelocations so you need to think aboutthat very carefullyand then third of all with hardwarewallets which i forgot to mentionone thing i like to tell new coinersis it's a good idea to have to buy twoof whatever you decide to buybecause if you have a second oneyou canyou can have the same backup wordsinitialized on both devicesso then if something happens to yourdevice not only do you have the seedwords available those those secretbackup words available to restore yourdevice you also have the second devicethat still has access to your funds soyou're not in a panic situationum so i always i tend to recommend topeople that they should buy two of thesame device whichever they choose umso that they they can have twoinitialize and you can keep those inseparate locations as wellif you wantokay yeah i think that's good adviceso when you're opening up a bitcoinwallet it shows a balanceum a common misconception isthatthat you know you just it shows yourbitcoin balance that's what's in yourwallet but in reality what's in yourwallet is basically a bunch of differentbitcoin transactions that all add up tothat balanceum we call those utxos uhthose those are unspent transactionoutputs utxos is what we call them youcan think of them like bills in yourwallet like maybe your wallet you knowyour cash wallet has50 in it but in reality it has two 20sand a 10and that's how bitcoin wallets work soyou have all these small utxos in therethat add up to your balance and that hasprivacy implicationsbecause ififtwo of those utxos come togetherum in a single transaction they'reobviously linked on this chainuh forever right we call it theblockchain it's this ledger oftransactions they'll be linked togetherbecause they were both spent in the sametransactionso that brings us to this idea of utxomanagementand coin control the idea oftrying tomanage thosebitcoin transactions in a privacy andcost effective way should you want to gointo that a little bityeah definitely um and quick i willstart with the two wallets that we keepmentioning blue wallet and samurai umoffer all the features that i'm justabout to cover that sort of help when itwhen it comes to to utxo managementandinspectoryeah sorry yeah i keep referring tomobile wallets but yeah the all of thedesktop uh the good desktop wallets thatwe've spoken about i've all got utxomanagement features as well um sothere's a couple of facets to it thefirst one is the ability to uh label thethe utxos or the pieces of bitcoin thatyou've got in your wallet so what wouldbe an example of a label might be thatif matt was to pay me for dinner uh orpay me back for dinner um when ireceived that transaction into my walleti could put a label on that to say thatthat's come from martin it was fordinnerum i could then receive my wages from myemployerumand i could put the the relevant labelon that just to know that where theorigin uhof that utxo is fromumso the once i've labeled themwhen i'm making future transactionsand i'mthere's two ways you can make atransaction you can let the wallet toconstruct it for you automatically whichthey might choose any random utxos andmerge them together again like matt saidto which will show common ownership thatmight not be a problem however if you uhwant to preserve your privacy and imight not want my employer to know thati'm friends with matt because he's a badperson um because i've labeled those i'mnot a bad person thoughbecause i play radical[Music]because i've labeled those utxos when ireceived them at the time um in you knowtwo weeks down the line when i'm goingto make a transaction um i can then chyou know consider and the person thati'm paying you know do i want them toknow that i know matt or do i want themto know that i work for the company thatpaid me uh with this utxo i can makethat informed decision then to say wellactually i'm just going to spend fromone of those pieces of bitcoin oractually it's not a bad thing matt's notreally a bad person i'm gonna combinethe two uh because the value that i wantto send i need to combine the twoum so those are the two two sort of mainfacets to it and and but obviously youcan't ummake a an informed decision when youcome to spend um if you don't know theorigins of all of the etxos that you'vegot and so they kind of go hand in handreally um you need to label so that whenyou come to spend you can make theinformed decision as to whether youshould merge or not yeah so a key aspectof bitcoin isif someone sends you bitcointhey can see where that bitcoin goes inthe futureand if you receive bitcoin you can seewhere that bitcoin came from in the pastsothis is why labeling is importantbecause you want to knowwhere that transaction came fromor it goes tobecausethat's who you're exposing your privacyto in that situationis that a good yeah installation yeahwhich you know um might not be a problemfor you know the person that i'm payingmight not um be able toor be clever enough to to use blockchainanalysis um but the other sort of umadversary that we need to consider hereis chain analysis firms that might betrying to umcluster or monitor your unchain activitywho you're spending to who you'regetting change back from uh to monitoryour habits to try and um piece togetherumyou know the identity because theblockchain doesn't have any identitiesat that at the blockchain layer um butthese companies work to kind oftie all the pieces together so that theycan um de-anonymize people and so it'snot just a case of umyou know hiding how much you earn fromyour friend uh it's also you know thesemore sophisticated actors that have gotmore a lot more resources to throw atthis and that you've also got to bear inmind as well unfortunately yeah you bothyou both don't want you don't want youremployer to knowwhat you're spending things onand you don't want the guy who sells youa sandwich to know how much money youmakebut on top of that we also have theseprofessional surveillance mercenariesthat work for governments dictators andcompaniesand they are just out there constantlytrying to track bitcoin transactions soyou also have that as a concernwhich leads us nicely onto coinjoin ithink if unless there's anything elseyou want to touch on no let's yep we cantalk about coinjoin now so coinjoin umis um acoordinated or collaborative transactionwhereyou and at least one other personwillcollaborate to construct the transactionthat casts some doubtas to theorigin and the output of the transactionto umto make suream thatstill could you still hear mei can still hear you yes oh sorry ithought i dropped out yes it's acoinjoin is a collaborative transactionwhere umthe the idea is that theuh somebody watching the blockchainagain chain surveillance firm youremployer your friend whoever they can'tumdeterministically orwith good probability be able to trackthepeople on the input side of thetransaction to the output side of thetransactionso it effectively attempts to put upsort of um a brick wall in your you knowthe the utxos history so that umanybody looking on chain can't be sure100umyou know is there one person involved inthis transaction is there 10 peopleinvolved in this transaction it justcasts doubt on the the uh path that thebitcoin has taken and and who sort of umyou know has the bitcoin change handshasn't it we we're not really sure so sotracking bitcoin is a probability gameumthese surveillance companies and theirtools will basically or just someonewho's curious and trying to spy on youum will basically assign a probabilityto every transaction if ownership haschanged because one of the things aboutbitcoin isyou know i could send bitcoin to myselfor i could send it to bitcoin q a anduh the chain doesn't delineate betweenthat so a key aspect of tracking bitcointransactions isumdetermining some kind of probabilitythat bitcoin actually changed hands andthen from there trying to seewhich hands it went from from who to whoum so coinjoin is this idea of acollaborative transaction and you canthink of it likeumjust for an example if you have fivepeople that are doing a coin jointtogetherinstead of uh having a simple path thatyou're following on chain and decidingif ownership has changed um all of asudden there's five different potentialpaths it could go downyou don't know which of the five peoplethat participatedwhich of their five outputs are themso it breaks that probability chainand it's a useful tool in terms oftrying torecr to have forward privacy have thisidea of someone who sent you bitcoindoesn't necessarily know which path yourbitcoin took going forwardyeah and specifically with umimplementations of coinjoin likewhirlpool which are known as equaloutput coin joints um the the the sortof notion is that everybody um on theoutput side all of the utx on the outputside of the transactionlook absolutely identical and soit's kind of uh i always like to use theanalogy of v for vendetta where you'vegot the million mask marchit's essentially the same thing but onthe blockchain where all of these utxosare indistinguishable from one anotherand so like matt said you've got someforward privacyand be quickand soi the the three major coin jointprojects our samurai whirlpool joinedmarket in wasabiumcitadel dispatch 15 was with the wasabiteam civil dispatch 16was with the join market teamand civil dispatchi don't know where he is i also did asamurai oneum is citadel dispatchit's there in your feed somewhere youknow uhstefan can just rattle them off he knowsexactly which one is which always amazesme that umi don't know which one it is i'll comeback to it and tell you but it's there'sthere's another dispatch with thesamurai team so if you're interested inthis uh consider going back andlistening to those threeumme and bitcoin q auh like samurai whirlpool the best youcan also you you don't have to usesamurai walla with it you can usesparrow wallet with it as wellumyeah yeah co-sign that samurai orsparrow a hands-down win is for me umespecially from a from a beginner'sperspective um definitely the easiestones to get started with in my opinionyou can continue on i'm trying to figureout which dispatchi'lli'll cover off one quick question that'sum quite on topic and somebody askedwhat's the difference betweenum coinjoin that we've just spoken abouton a coin tumbler so the unfortunatelythe words uh or the the meanings havebeen kind of umwhitewashed somewhat over the years butum generally speaking a coin tumbler isa centralized service where you willhave tosend inyour bitcoin and give up a custody of itto whoever's running the tumbler andthey will send you somebody else'sbitcoin backand i absolutely wouldn't recommendanybody use thesebecause you're putting yourselfum completely in the hands of whoever'srunning the tumbler and that you knowwhether they're going to send you yourbitcoin back or notand yeah soand you also not only you're trustingthem with your bitcoin if you use acustodial mixer it's the same ideas ascustodyum because custodial risks with walletsum you're also you're trusting them withyour privacy and your fundsum so the key aspect of coinjoin is isthe idea that you are reducing trust inany kind of centralized third party umwasabi and samurai have a centralizedserver that they doum[Music]that they use to coordinate the coinjoins to make them easier better uxuh and more reliablethose coordinators are blindedwith samurai specifically you can use itwithout your own node and then you'retrusting samurai's node so that goesback to our earlier conversation aboutusing your own node you should use yourown node when you use samuraiotherwise you are trusting them withyour transaction and balance informationas as is the case with all light walletsum i found it so so it's still dispatch15 is wasabi still dispatch 16 is joinedmarket and still dispatch 30 is samuraiso consider listening to thoseokay i think are we done on coinjsshould we move on to the next topic um ihave multisig as the next topic butshould we do lightning real quick firstsure thing yeah yeah i think it's apt umsoquick high level on what the thelightning network is uh it is a scalingsolution for bitcoin that umallows you toum transact with uhactual real bitcoin um but you don't doso with what's known as an on-chainfootprint and so it allows you to sortof lock up a small amount of well asmuch bitcoin as you want onto thissecond layer solution known as thelightning networkso that you can umyou essentially just defer the theoverall settlement um of any number oftransactions from going on chain to toreduce fees and also to allow you totransact um much quickerso whereas uh one on chain transactionyou know might cost you a couple hundredsats depending on the fees and you youmight be able to send you know 10or even 100lightning network um transactions forthe sameuh for the same amount of fees um nowthere is uhunfortunately lots of caveats with thelightning network again in terms ofbeing able to do it properly uh with uhthe best way to do so be with one of theuh no packages that we've spoken aboutbefore andwhich will dictate that you need tomanage your own sort ofyour own channels which is essentiallywhere you lock up this bitcoin to beable to to transact on this second layerumso it's a little bit more of a hurdle toto get on board with um but you you sortof can save yourself a fair bit on feesespecially if we ever see a feast bikeagain um which i think is inevitable umthe i don't knowinevitable um sofirst of all there's been a lot ofdispatches on lightning if you gothrough the feedconsider listening to those there's likea lot of different caveats and nuanceswhen using lightningspecifically with privacy i did a fullprivacy episode with openobs and anthonythat's still dispatch 21 that's onlightning privacyuh so consider checking that out but themain differentiation that you as a newuser should think about with lightningis going back to our transaction feeconversation earlierwhich iswhen you use a regular bitcointransactionyour transaction fee is not based on theamount you send it could be kind ofweird for youuh it's it's actually based on theamount of utxos that you useuh for the transaction it's based on thedata size not the amount of money thatis sentsoyou could end up sending a five dollartransaction with bitcoin on chain aregular bitcoin transaction and it couldcost the same as sendinga five million dollar transactionnow with lightningit's different the way fees arecalculated on lightning is based on theamount you're sending so that'll be morecomparable to something that you're usedto in traditional finance world where ifyou send more money you're going to paya higher fee you send less money you'regoing to pay a lower feenowuh moon wallet with 2us as we talkedabout earlier mobile wallet supportslightningand blue wallet supports lightning nowif you use blue wallet in its defaultstate with lightning it's going to be acustodial walletwhich i don't loveuh if you insist on using it use it witha small amount because they can takeyour funds you are trusting them withyour privacy um ifuhyou can also use blue wallet withsomething called lnd hub which some ofthese node projects offeri think umbral and my node offered idon't know who else offers it but if youuse it with lnd hub or your friend's lndhub then it's not custodial with bluewallet it's custodial with who's everrunning the lnd hub so if you run thelnd hub yourselfthen it's not custodialotherother lightning specific wallets onmobilethat you can use so moon does bothblue wallet does boththen there's lightning specific mobilewallets that are very good uh there'sphoenixwallet uh there's breeze walletumbreeze b-r-e-e-zcontinuing the bitcoin naming scheme ofusing words and spelling themdifferently um is there anotherlightning wallet that i'm missinglightningeclair as well haven't youwell claire is phoenixphoenixyeah why do they have two okay but yeahboth of those are good yeah one allowsyou to manage your own channels and theother one does it for youokay phoenix does it for youyepokay so forget eclair your new corneryou have phoenix and you have breezewallet or you can use moon or bluewallet and that'srather than for savings you should thinkof that more asokay this is like my spending wallet mytransaction fees are based on the amounti send i'm going to be sending smalleramounts umso i i might use lightning rightyeah i agree i'm quite a big fan ofphoenix um especially from a perspectiveof you know one that a wallet thatmanages the channels for you and i mightget a lot of for this in the chatbut i'm i'm a firm believer that mostnew users don't shouldn't strive todive head first into lightning withtheir own channels because it's it'sit's not easy it's not approachable andeverything that we've already discussedum in terms of holding your own keys umuh using coinjoin and and not using kycare far more important than uh strivingto get your own channels up and runningum quickly uh i don't know what youthink about that matt and i'm waitingfor the in the chat no i mean ithink i i i think umlightning on mobile uh with the walletswe just mentioned moon blueum breeze phoenixfor smaller spending amountsuh is very accessibleuh actuallyif you if you actually want to dolightning in a proper sovereign wayum that i would say is a more advancedthing don't get intimidated by it but ii think it's important for ourall-encompassinggetting started guide that we do mentionit it exists and what are the you knowdifferent trade-offs basically thetrade-off there is a little bit you'regetting less security uh you're gettingless reliability with lightning umbut you're getting lower feesfaster transactions all else equalum[Music]and it could be very useful in a mobilespending type of situationyeah i agreephoenix and brees really great ways toto get started with lightning that havesort of their own unique um trade-offsuh that kind of give the the best ofboth worlds from it from a new userperspectivewhen you compare them with umcustodial solutions like the defaultblue wallet or running your own channelsand that's one of theyeah i mean that's one of the reasonswhy i like moon so much like moon with2us has like different tradeoffsum it doesn't have a standardized backupprocessuh it's you know if if you'rea lot of big corners will say it's youknow not a lightning wallet but at theend of the dayit's not a lightning wallet because youstore all your funds on chain you're notstoring it in a proper lightning walletum but what's cool about moon isif you scan a qr code it could be alightning qr code or it could be aregular bitcoin qr code and it justautomaticallyfigures that out for youum and and vice versa yeah so so you canjust have you can have some spendingcash in your moon wall at muunand whatever whatever bitcoin qr codeyou scan it will send but it doesn'thave power user features it doesn't havethat coin selection that we were talkingabout with utxo management it doesn'thave labelingit doesn't have a standard backupprocessso these are all things to keep in mindright multisig multisig let's let's gohere's where we get into the weeds alittle bit um right so you've been inthe weeds for a whileall of the uh wallets that we've spokenabout umthe desktop wallets mobile wallets alloperate umon what we colloquially call a singlesig setup where they have um a singlesecret or backup um which is requiredwhen you want to spend your bitcoin amulti-sig wallet is where you combinetwo or more of theseseparate wallets together to create abrand new walletwhen you set up this multisig wallet youcan dictatethe minimumamount of keys required to be able tomake ato sign or authorize a send transactionso that could betwo from a possible three keys is apopular one all the way up to somethingelaborate like 11 or 15 you know whichmight be uh used in sort of a businesssetting props um but two of three whereyou need two signers from a possiblethree that were created to that we useto create the wallet to sign off on anytransactions from that wallet so whywould you want to do that wellwith a single sig wallet and some of thethree theoretical attack vectors ifsomeone's to someone but somebody was tosteal your deviceand and umwhile you know if they snatch your phonewhile it's out of your hand and you'vegot your wallet unlocked um they cansteal your bitcoin if that was one ofthe keys in a multi-sig wallet where youneeded two to spend from then they can'tsteal anything from youumanother one of the attacks that multisigprotect from is known as a retirementattack where there might be a malicioushardware wallet vendor thatdoesn't publish their source code um andthey umhave some uhmalware baked into into the the into thedevice and that is actually uh has theability to stealyour bitcoin i will say again correct meif i'm wrong game out but that has neverhappened again it's a theoretical attackbut if you were to use um a multi-sigsetup where you've got differenthardware wallet manufacturers if one ofthose is is maliciousum they can't get access to your fundsbecause they don't have you know if it'sjust one key out of two that arerequired they don't have the uhthe minimum number of keys required tosteal anythingall the goodall the good wallets all the goodhardware wallets are open source sotheoretically open source meansthat the code is available for you toverifyum and you can read the code line byline nowif you're a new coiner you're probablyup to this point you're already reallyintimidated you're like matt i can'tread codei'm aware okaysoat the end of the dayit is very good that you're able totechnically verify the code but mostpeople will be updating their hardwarewallets and they will not be verifyingthe code so there is some trust that youare you're trusting that hardware walletmanufacturer to not ship uh maliciouscode to you and you're also trustingthemuh that that the actual device wasn'tcompromised when it was first sent toyou right so with multisig the idea isyou can have multiple but specificallyin a hardware wallet ida hardware wallet multisig the idea isyou can have multiple vendorsuh that aremultiple different hardware wallets thatcome together to form your walletandyou needa combination of them as bitcoin q a wassaying a common one is two of three youneed two of them to spend the fundsthis reduces trust in any specifichardware wallet manufactureryou also have the added benefituh that those backup words instead ofthose backup words being aumone and done situation if someone findsthose secret backup words we call themseed words if someone finds those wordsthey have access to your funds in amulti-sig setup you haveummultiple sets of backup words and theyhave to find the required threshold ofbackup wordsin order to spend your funds so ifyou're using a two of three you're gonnahave three sets of backup words you'regonna have three hardware walletsthose backup boards obviously can be onsteel as we said earlierum and you can have them in differentlocations so bitcoin gives you bitcoinwith multisig gives you this uniquesituationwhere you can have a geographicallydistributeduh security setup where you're holdingyour own coinbutthethe the keys to access it can be locatedin different places they can beduplicated you can keep copies of themin different places and for someone toactually compromise you and take yourfunds they're gonna need to have accessto a combination secretwe lost bitcoin q a about two minutesago or a minute and a half ago and i'mjust gonna keep talking until hereconnectssothat is the main benefit of multisig[Music]do not once again do not get intimidatedhereuhplenty of people store bitcoin in singlesig uh setups it is thenormal way of setting it upum this is something you might graduatetouh multisig ux multisigumi guess ux can be kind of a complicatedwordlike the way you interface with themultisig walletis a relativelynew thing in bitcoinumso it it has a little bit more of alearning curve it is a little bit morerough around the edgessoyou want to get really comfortable withit as i said earlier you want to bebacking up restoring spending receivinggetting comfortable with it separatelyof your single sig setupnow one cool aspect of multisigis that you canactually have a single sig walletuh so you can be using a hardware walletthat is single sig and then you cantake that single sig and you canactually also use it in a multi-sigenvironmentandit can be one signer of for instance thetwo of three in the multi-sig but alsoit could also be its separate walletum andi guess the main advantage thereumi guess there's two main advantagesthere first of all if someone findsyour single sigback up your your secret words uh itmight have some small amount of funds onit and they think that's all your fundsthey they can't tell that it's in amulti-sig setupumso they might just take that funds andthink they took all your bitcoin umthis thesecondary benefit isthat you know you can repurpose thesethese hardware wallets and use them formultiple wallets now one other caveathere is with multi-sig you do want toback up additional information besidesjust your seed wordsumbitcoin q a came in and then left againso i will continueumthe popular multi-sig softwaresparrowspectre supports it blue wallet supportsitthey will tell you what you need to backup and make sure you save all thatinformation now that informationthat additional information that's notyour seed words umthey will have terms like derivationpathum descriptorthe list of something called x pubs youdon't necessarily have to know what allof that means you just have to save itand you just have to realize thatwhileseed words area security risk if someone gets yourseed wordsthat information that separateinformation that you have to back upwith a multi-stick wallet is a privacyrisk so if someone finds that they cansee how much you're holding in themultisig but they can't necessarilyspend itbut you need that information plus yourbackup boards in order touh to spend your funds bitcoin q are youbacki am apologies for that that'll happen ithink it's my networkno worries at all um i just continued onand i just kept talking about multisigdo you be holding it downumii get i mean i think we arei i think i sufficiently explainedmultisig tradeoffs and and benefitsumshould we move on to mistakes commonmistakesyeah did you cover sort of thealternatives to doing it yourself themultitec approach no i didn't that'sgreat why don't you go into thatyeah so obviously matt's just outlinedsome of the potential pitfalls withdoing it yourself umso one of the other options is known askind of collaborative custodyalternatives where um there will be acentralized service uhsome examples are on chain capital anduh casaumwhere they will help you coordinate amultisit quorum and where they hold oneof the keysand so that in the event that you wereto umso i'll give you an example you'd have akey on your mobile phoneyou'd have a key on a hardware walletand one of theseservices will hold the key as wellso they only have one key so they can'tsteal from you which is greatumbut if you were to lose say your phonewhat their key or the key on yourhardware while and he didn't have itbacked up they will be able to step inas a third party to help you move yourbitcoin so that in a doomsday scenarioand you um you don't lose your lifesavings which is really greatyou will pay for this service and againi'm not sure on how much each charge thebottom tier i think is just over 100umlast time i checked per year and one ofthe the trade-offs with this is that umunless you sign up uh without yourpersonal information which i believe isquite difficult to do umthethese uh centralized um entities thathold the key and part of yourmulti-sitcorum they know who you arethey know how much bitcoin you hold inthat wallet because they hold one of thekeys and they alsohold the sort of uhthe wallet file if you like to put itsimply and so that they canjust as a kyc exchange can umbe able to tie you to your bitcoinidentity so it's worth paying up thetrade-offs yeah and you're using theirnode sothe assumption is if you do this if youuse one of these providersuh you're trusting them with yourprivacy but they will hold your hand andthey will have a spare key for you aswellum and they will help you onboard intothe process they will help you gethardware wallets they will go throughthat whole process but you are trustingthem with your privacy they know yourtransactions they know your balancesandin 99 of situations they know who youare as well uh they'll know the ipaddress of your of your devices that youconnect fromthis is all kind of getting a little bittoo much into the weeds but the key isthat you're trusting them with yourprivacyum i was explaining earlier justbasically doing it yourself so you coulduse your own note and you aren'ttrusting someone in that situation youcan still haveumother people hold keys for you so abitcoin q a started with a two of threesetup because that's a very common setupbut another common setup is a three offive setup and if you do a three of fivesetup you have five total keys and youneed three to spendsoif you need three to spendyou can hold three keys yourself so thatyou know you have and you put them indifferent locations and you know youhave enough to spend it yourself butthen you can also have you know a familymember a frienda lawyerholdhold a key you can have differentcombinations of people hold the key soit can be very useful inum[Music]specifically in in situations whereyou're trying like inheritancesituations where if if you pass away youhave large bitcoin savings uh you knowmaybe a lawyer is holding one in a trustmaybe a couple family members areholding individual ones and theybasically all need to collaboratetogether in order to spend your funds ifyou have three keys with other peopleum but you can also do it in a way whereyou don'tyou don't they never have the thresholdthey need to compromise you pluscombined togetheryeah i think umjust one final thing before we move onto the next topic um inheritance is abig one for me that um i i sort of liketo drive over people who seem to seemkeen to kind of jump into the diyapproaches thatyou know you might have spent some timelistening to some podcasts watching someuh tutorials or reading some guides andfeel comfortable in setting up amultisigumsetup um but what happens if you're notaround tomorrow unexpectedly uh is yourspouse your next kin are they going tobe able to coordinate a spend from a twoor three or a three or five do they knowwhere to find the keys do they know howto recover it and if you answer no toany of those questions then uh all ofyour life savings disappears when youdisappear soand something to bear in mind especiallyif you're going to take the diy approach100 i'd also add that there's a middleground hereuh specifically supported by cold cardcalled seed xor and basically in thatsituation instead of having one seedit's not multisig but instead of havingone seed you have two seeds and you needboth of them in order to spend yourfundsso it's a little bit different thanmulti-sig it can be more accessible topeople uh because you don't have theseadditionalcomplications that we were justdiscussing with multi-sigbut it gives you that benefit of nothaving a single seedbackup wordsthat can be compromised by someonethere's also something that's supportedby pretty much every wallet out therecalled a passphraseand in that situation you have thesebackup boards are usually 12 wordphrases or 24 word phrases thepassphrase is the 13th word or the 25thword and you pick that yourselfso if you do that method then you cankeep the passphrase separate from yourbackup words if someone wants tocompromise you they need access to bothumand i mean if it's a weak passphrasethey might just take your backup boardsand keep trying pass raisesumbut it it adds an additional umburden on them to try and compromise youwithout going through a multi-sig setupum anotherinteresting thing about passphrases isyou can store money on the bear backupwords and then you cannot when you use apasswords it's a separate wallet soin that situation you can actually keepfunds on youryour basic backup boardsand then if someone finds that they'lljust steal those that money and theymight not know you have a passphrasewith the majority of your savings in itum so that's just something to keep inmindawesome do you want to cover off uh somesome common mistakesnext on the listyeah i think common mistakes is a goodspot to go nextuh so i've got quite a lengthy list hereandthe first one of which unfortunately iuhfell fell prey to a little bit um andthat is uh it comes back to our veryfirst pointof cape kycmultiple exchanges and without any realneed to really um so i've just uh sortof expose myself to you know put my nameon loads of different databasesand soit's an unfortunate one that you can'treally undo like we spoke about beforeand if you were to you know listen tothis podcast and decide that youumstill want to gofor a kyc exchange because you think youknow the task of going uh no care adviceandtry and limit your umyour exposure to this by just signing upwith one reputable exchange umi think that's a good one to start anddid youi think that's very good advice like ifyou are going to use a kyc service whereyou're providing your identityinformation you should choose itcarefully you should choose someone youtrust the mostand you shouldnot sign up for a lot of people justsign up for a ton of different servicesyou should only you should sign up forthe bare minimum ideally if you're gonnado it you sign up for oneyou use it solely just to buy bitcoinand then send it to your own walletsumand and you don't you don't use anyother additional kyc services you wantto limit that as much as possiblesecond thing is did you change your micsetup at all because it's way worse nowthan it was beforeuhhello i changed my computer um i'll havea player how much while you're talkingnow turn up is it just quietno we can hear you but it's just likebreaking up a little bit it's likecutting in and outall right i'll let i'll play aroundumanother common mistakeuhthat i see people make isi i mean gambling on coins so a lotof people will think that um bitcoin istoo expensive and i've missed the boatand i i'm too late to bitcoin umliterally every single person who hasentered bitcoin at any time in bitcoinhistory has thought they were too latethere's like a famous screenshot ofsomeone on one of the bitcoin forums uhlamenting that they didn't get in atfive cents and instead they got in at adollar and they were too late and theymissed the busum so everyone feels that wayuh you're not alone in that it'simportant to realize that you cantransact insmaller units of account we call themsatssoyou can you don't have to have a fullbitcoin you don't you don't you don'tneed like right now bitcoins at almost70 thousand dollars you don't need toput 70 000 and to use bitcoin uh satsare the smallest unit of bitcoin there'sa hundred million of themper bitcoin andright now sats you can get 1500 for adollar so you can send any amount ofsats you want to send you can send twodollars worth you can send 25 centsworthumit doesn't matter don't get caught up inin in thinking that bitcoin is tooexpensiveuhwhat common thing that these other coinswill dois they make it so they have so manyunitsthat it seems like it's cheaper than itis just to try and get you in the doorit's a it's a marketing tactic so justkeep that in mind uh q are you thereyeah how's my mic now oh so much betteri'm glad i brought it up perfect okay doyou have more common mistakesuh yeah common one um is just notpracticing umenough with transacting uh testing mybackups for my hardware walletstesting different wallets even usingtest net just practice practice practiceand getting comfortable uh using the thevarious tools that we've spoken aboutandgetting comfortable with it either usingtestnet which is basically uha copy a carbon copy of bitcoin that'shas that holds no value you can get itfor free onwebsites called faucets where you can goon and just mimic the normal behavior ofa walletand without the fear oflosing any real value and so you cansend some test net bitcoin to to your hardware wallet and youcan wipe it recover itand just to get really reallycomfortable with with that process sothatif um the worst was happening and yousomething was to happen to your houseuh where you say bitcoin wherever youstore your coin andyou're when you're in that packed stateit's not like the first time you touchyour hardware wallet for five yearsbecause you you know you've done thatyou know people call practice so you'vegot this lots of time if you send realvalue in there but it'sconnected to you and because you know ifyou're in a panic and you you need tomove your bitcoin quickly the last thingyou might be doing is doing itin unfamiliar uhsituation or in a familiarsituation wherebecause that's when mistakes happen andyou could uh muck something upyeah so we see that happen a lot whereyou know peopleuh so i actually don'tespecially for newcomers i don't know ifyou need to use testnetum it adds just anothercomplication to your processumbut but what happens a lot is likepeople will buy bitcoin they'll send itto a hardware wallet they never reallyuh get comfortable with itthen bitcoin goes up in valuesignificantly and like four years laterthey're trying to spend it and they'rejust not comfortable at allso you really want to get comfortablewith it you want to practice sendingreceiving backing up and restoring umand just you know i don't think testthat's necessary in that situationbecause you should just do it with thesmall amounts you knowuse you know send five dollars back andforthuh erase the wallet restore it from yourbackup see that your five dollars arestill thereum one nice thing about my earlierapproach that i mentioned if having twoof the same hardware walletis without putting funds at risk at allyou can load up one hardware wallet withsome bitcoinand then you can restore iton your second hardware wallet you canload up those secret words onto thathardware wallet and if your funds arethere and you can spend them then youknow you did the backup and restoreprocess correctly without actuallywiping the original wallet so that'sanotherbenefit you're basically verifying yourbackup and restore processyou don't want to be in a situationwhere you have a lot of moneyandyou have a lot of money on the line andyou've never done a backup you've neverhave you've never done a restoredprocess and you're just freaking out andmaybe you wrote down the words wrongi've had that happen to friends wherewe've had to guess the word that theythey wrote down wrong or wrote down inbad handwriting um so you don't youdon't want to be in that situation youwant to practice practice practicei think just to add to that uh backupprocess as well is thatmost of the umor the hardware wallets that we'vetalked about this evening havemultiple different types of backups aswell so i think it's worth noting thatpractice using both of them as well sowe've got the the siege words umboth call card and passport alsoofferingbackups as well where you can store itbackup onto a micro sd card um which is alittle bit easier to store and so iwould urge people to practice restoringfrom both methods as well becauseat the end of the day if again if in adoomsday scenario you don't know whichmethod of backup you're actually goingto have access to or which is survivedwhatever um you know doomsday scenariohas actually happened100um before we move on to more commonmistakes we have alex mccluskey in thechat asking about 401k ira fundsum if you're trying to hold bitcoin in aa in a in a tax beneficial way in yourretirement accounti would just keep this very simple uh ifyou do haveuh a 401k or an ira where you alreadyhave funds in it and you want to movethem into bitcoinjust consider using uh the serviceoffered by unchained capital that'sunchained.com disclosure they are asponsor of ofmy other show rabbit will recap thisshow does not have sponsorsumbut they're a sponsor becausethey're a good team it's a good productumi have friends there that are workingthere my buddy jeff andrew runs theirtheir retirement division and they willhold your handthey will help you through it obviouslyas we said earlier the caveat is you'retrusting them with your privacyum but pretty much in all situationswith retirement funds if you're using atax beneficial retirement uh methodyou're going to have to trust someonebecause it's all getting reported to thegovernment as wellthe nice thing about what unchained doesis you hold your own keys so you getthat tax benefit um but you're holdingyour own keys they can't spend yourfundsa lot of the other programs that are outthereumcan can spend your funds at will and youhave to trust them completely with thesecurity of your funds and your privacyso just something to keep in mindyeah the next one umfrom me is kind of a little bit moreoutside of the box umi lurked around on on bitcoin twitterand in some of the communities uh for alot longer than i really should have umwhen i started to uh interact with withpeople in the you knowwallet chat rooms or the no chat roomsand to use a few examplesmy knowledge grew exponentially fromthen onwards from having thoseinteractions versus me just sitting onthe sidelines and kind of you knowliking a few tweets every now and thenso if i was to go back and kind of havemy time again i i'd absolutely startgetting involved and start contributingand to the conversation much muchearlier because uh personally speakinganywaymy my knowledge just uh you knowskyrocketed compared to where i was justa couple of years ago and so big one forme that oneyeah that's uhand uh i just i think like learn bydoing right practice with small amountsumand get your feet wet rather than feelintimidated and feel like you have toread everything and listen to everythingand watch everything uhbefore you even get your feet wetyeah another one as well is and and mattmight roll his eyes at this one is iskind of going publicumthere there's a lot of value in instaying in the proverbial shadow so tospeak um i would urge people you knownot touh sort of start shouting from therooftops uh that they own bitcoin againbecause you know we talked earlier aboutkyc and how we kind ofcan paint a sort of red cross on yourback a little bit well shout from therooftops um when bitcoin hits anall-time high to all your friendsand might uh inadvertently do the samething one day um you know yeah 100 alittle bit jealous you never know he'sgoing to get jealous andtell somebody else you tell somebodyelse who'san individual that might want to try andget their hands on it soum i would be be candid about who youwho you speak to bitcoin about and it'sa bita double-edged sword that one because uhi think we've all got a little bit of apersonal responsibility to try and helpon on board others as well so um alsosay just kind of be selective about whoyou speak to it and what you sayyeah it is um it might sound a littlehypocritical coming for meum as aas as a as a public bitcoin figureumbutdefinitely in the beginning you shouldnotyou should you should not be talking youshould try and reduce how much you talkabout bitcoin don't make it obvious thatyou own bitcoin don't post on socialmediauh consider using a name like bitcoin qa does i mean it might surprise you buthe wasn't born with that namehe decided on that name himself for theinternet for his bitcoin workumin the future if you do want to becomemore public about ituhyou can do so in a moreresponsible wayum rather than doing it right in thebeginning you can never come back fromit once you do itum so it's something to keep in mindyou should never talk about your ownbitcoin you should never talk about yourown how much bitcoin you haveumthese are best practices uh you don'tyou don't uheven if it's a friend or a family memberit might seem like small amount todaybut in the futureuh it could be a large amount and theywill not forget it they tend to rememberone of the first questions mostfriends and family will ask you is howmuch bitcoin you own they love askingthat questiondo not answer it explain why you don'twant to answer it for themumif people do know you own bitcointhis is where that multi-sig setupreally shines because you can have itgeographically distributed you can haveyour keys in different locations um thatare far away from each other that makeyou getting compromised more difficulteven in a physical attack situation andobviously it is more ideal to live in aplace where you haveum proper gun rights and you can defendyourselfumso these are things to considerum if i was to do it againi probably would not be uh you know aspublic as i am about bitcoin um i made ajudgment calllater on in my bitcoin journey that ifelt we needed more public bitcoinfigures that were talking about realissues and specifically privacy um so imade that judgment call but there aresome mornings that i wake up and regretitumbut there are precautions you can takeand there are benefits though to beingsemi-public about your bitcoin usage uhmeeting people i've met some of the bestpeopleyou know i have i have basically i havefamily now that wouldn't exist otherwiseum but these are all things that youshould considerum as part of your bitcoin journey butin the beginningvery very very stronglywould sayyou know keep keep it as discreet aspossibleum you never knowyou knowyou you don't want to expose yourself toa malicious actor your government couldturn on bitcoina foreign government can use thatinformation against you uh if you'retraveling across a border or somethinglike thatso you you want to keep this in mindyeah the final um sign off one for me umwould beuhi just completely got out of my brainuh what is another two fa is another onea good one to touch on i think um yeswould be um if if you and it's just comeback into me now so i've got two tofinish off um if you again listen tothis podcast decide that no kosc is notfor you and you want to sign up for anexchange and a lot of these exchangeswill prompt you to use uh sms-basedtwo-factor authentication to um i'musing air quotes here to secure youraccountum this is where you'll get a textmessage to when you try and log into theto the exchange they'll send you a textmessage to authorize that login um therehave been multiple umuhinstances where this has beenexploited people have had theirinformation and their accounts hacked onthese exchangeswhich if youunfortunately have got funds on thataccountcan be withdrawn to whoever's got accessto your account they can withdraw it totheir own walletanda better alternative and would be to usean app-based uhtwo-factor authentication so an examplewould be umthere's one called anduh there's one called a edgiest uhthere's another one called um help meout here matt i've drawn a blank umuh did you say agesyeah i said aegis yep aegis is myfavoriteany app-based one and far more secureand there's been far f well aegis isopen source aegis is open source uhthat's a e g i s and the backup processis very easy you got to remember whenyou when you use these authenticatorapps umif your phone dies you want to make sureyou have a backup of themso yeah the most popular one is googleauthenticator and it's notlast i mean i haven't used it inmaybe six years or something like thatbut previously it wasn't easy to back upso make sure you're using one that iseasy to back upand back it up and keep multiple copiesyeah or the other alternative is you canget umlike a physical device that acts as yourthe second factor authentication lookslike a bit of a usb key that providesthe the additional authorizationbut less services tend to umoffer compatibility with those100umi i would say i think for most peoplethe physical device is overkillum can a sophisticated attackercompromise a phone base two factoruh yesum have we seen any widespread cases ofthat no do they still need your emailand your password yes umon that note you shouldn't be using thesame emails and the same passwords indifferent placesum if you go to haveibinpone.com you canput your email address in and it'll tellyou wheneveruh database gets leaked with your emailor your password or your personalinformation um so that's a veryimportant resource but but what we see alot of times is like there'll be like aleaklike maybe facebook will get hacked andthose emails and passwords will then beused at all the other services to tryand get into your accountum so that two-factor code gives you anadditional protection on top of that butyou really shouldbe trying to limit reuse of emailaddresses and never reuse passwords umyeahuh yeah there's one in the chat scoobysnacks asking is a password manager agood idea yes definitely would recommendit to anybody my personal favorite isis bit warden again another free andopen source uh software they do offer apaid version as well but the thefreemium uhoption is perf is perfectly good enoughfor for uh 99 of users i would sayyeah bit warden's great um you justgottaif you're using a password managerum there's some nuance there because ifyou're not self-hosting your passwordmanager you're using awhat's the main onelastpass people love lastpassumit's closed source you're kind ofputting all your eggs in one basketuhso there's some concern there you knowif you if you have all your passwords inthis password manager and that passwordmanager gets compromised then all ofyour accounts are compromisedumwhat i think is like a veryuh easy accessible thing forumnew users or people that are concernedis is your really important passwordsyou can just write them in a notebookyou write them in a notebooksomeone's going to need to get access tothat notebook physically in order tocompromise youumyou might not want to write it outcompletely clear you know maybe somethings you remember versus some thingsare on the paperyou can develop your own like kind ofcode system don't over complicate ityou'll probably forget the passwordum[Music]but uhpaper and pen paper and pen is a triedand true methodyeah absolutely and then just don't putit on athe final one that went out my headbefore um waswe've spoken about uh you know there's alot of information the past couple ofhours umdon't try and uh do everything in thespace of a week especially if you areliterally at step one um i would sort ofpick one of these topics you know wespoke about them in aumin a specific order for a reason and iwould urge people to sort of start fromstep one and try and master each stepbefore they move to the net before theymove on or at least not try to do toomany of them at the same timedepending on the approach depending onthe the approach that you take for thedifferent tools that we've we've spokenuh you know to do it properly and to doit justice and to understand it andpractice it like we've been like we'vebeen sort ofreiterating it's gonna take you you knowum a good bit of time you're gonna haveto dedicate some time to do this and tomaster some of these tools so trying todo too much too soon is setting yourselfup to to fail so take your time uh beum deliberate about it and and sort ofmaster something then move onyeah and our i that's great advice andas bitcoin q a said our order in thisepisode was intentionalso don't feel like you have to gothrough all the steps at once butgo throughthat order was how we we we chose thatorder specifically because we think it'sa very um[Music]efficient effectiveuh managing trade-offs and stuff balanceof what order you should kind of becoming into this um we also have someperson in the chatum who uses the nim some person so everytime i call him out in the chat i soundlike i'm just don't care about his nameuh asking for the best a two-factor appfor ios i really like authenticator plusfor ios users um i think it's availableon android as well but if you're onandroid i really just like aegisumso yeah there you go for that answerum i have on this list bitcoin q a ihave common questions do you have commonquestions that you have in mind orum i've got nothing noted down but kindof umoff the top of my headum a common one that i get is sort of uhis umis this setup good for me or is thiswallet the one i should useuhyou know insert service or or tool hereyou know is this goodum it's the thing with bitcoin and andusing the tools properly that we've beenspeaking about is thatwhat matter i might recommend from ourown personal experiencesmight not be perfectly applicable toyour own personal uh throat metal threatmodels or skill set um soagain we we have kind of covered thisground a little bit earlier but is umjust try things out um you know by i'mnot saying don't come to the people imatter myself and ask for advice youknow we're always um more than happy toto to help out um but the best thing todo is to sort ofget your hands dirty and try these toolsyou know you can do it for for free orfor a very low fees at the moment andjust testing out wallets or or differentdevicesor multi-sig setups if you want to gothat far coinjoin implementationsumbest thing to do is get your hands dirtyget get amongst the communities and youknow what's perfect for one person mightnot be perfect for another so umit's a bit of adyor do your own research and getcomfortable with what's going to workfor you really100 um just to reiterate umbitcoin q a has all of his guides atbitcoiner.guideumi have a list of resources and tools atcivildispatch.comhelpat the top of civildispatch.com help ihave also i have links toboth bitcoin q aummyselfand our buddy katan from australia whoruns ministry of nodes offers uhwe offer private one-on-ones and there'slinks to all of that at the top ofcivildispatch.comhelpum so if you dofeel that you you have the need for aone-on-one a specific time to jump on acallum that is available to you as well ihighly recommend both bitcoin q aand and katan uh for that and that's whythey are at the top of that pageumi thinkuh narwhal tacos has an interestingpoint i i kind of touched on it but ifelt like it was a little bit too earlyin the episode so i didn't go heavy intoitumhe's asking have you explained that noone actually holds their sats in a wallat just the key it took me a while towrap my head around thatthat is absolutely correctum you're not actually storing yourbitcoin you're storing the key thatallows you to access and spend yourbitcoin um so when we talk about allthese wallets when we talk abouthardware wallets and mobile wallets it'sreally uh either piece of software apiece of hardware that is that isstoring that secret key for you andallowing you to easily access that soyou can access your bitcoin um i thinkthat's an important point but i i do iwould say thatthat's almost more of ai don't know i i feel like it's more ofan advanced thingfor all intents and purposes you cankind of operate under the assumptionthat

bitcoin onapple pay here's what he saidit's something that we're looking atit's not something we have uhimmediate plans to douhfori would sort of characterize it as thereare things that i wouldn't dolike umuh our our cash balancei wouldn't go invest that in crypto uhnot because i wouldn't invest my ownmoney in crypto but because i don'tthink people buy an apple stockto get exposure to cryptoand so if they want to do that they canthey can uhuhyou know invest directly in crypto orthrough other meansuh and so i wouldn't do thatand i'm i'm not planning to in theimmediate future to take crypto for ourproductsas a as a mean of tender uh but thereare other things that we're definitelylooking at like whatuh like i wouldn't want tohave anything to announce todaywell let me ask you a different questionbecause you just said that you might notdo it personallydo you own crypto in any bitcoin orethereum would you play around with thisi i do yeah i think it's reasonable toown it as a as a part of a diversifiedportfolio and i'm not giving anybodyinvestment advice by the wayso[Music]happy bitcoin tuesday freaks it's yourboy matt o'dell here for anothercitadel dispatch the interactive liveshow

it's all encompassing from startto finish new new bitcoin are cominginto the space trying to do things youknow the right way trying to do thingsin a secure wayumand and just have it all in a singleepisode have it all in a singleconversationso as i was saying earlier the writerdies that are in the live chat um if youhave questions put your questions in ifif you're not a beginner and you'relistening in and you think we missedsomethinguh feel free to put that in the livechat as well and just a reminder thelive chat is accessible through thetwitter twitch and youtube streams andthey all getfed into uh the main chat so with allthat said i'd like to introduce bitcoinq a how's it going bitcoin q ahey matt it's going good thank you forhaving me back on uh it's been a while ithink um episode number two was now withthat with ergo so uh yeah lookingforward to getting back to it and uhrunning through some some of thebeginner-focused uh stuff that seems tobe missing from some of the podcasts uhfloating around me to tend to get jumpinto the weeds pretty quickly sometimesdon't we yeah i mean i have a feeling weare going to also be jumping into theweeds but we're going to try and do itin a nice constructive path into theweedsyeah i need you to keep me uh keep me incheck on that onebut yeah you are a dispatch lg it hasbeen it's been a minute and uh we'vewe've both been through a loti like to see like to think that we'vebeen through it together and uh yeahjust uhlove that you're back joining us and youknow i hope it's you know not just thesecond time it'll be many more times inthe futureumso with all that said freaks uh we havea bit of a structure that we set up forthis episode which is unusual fordispatch but i think it'll keep usmore focused um and so we're going tostart withactuallygetting bitcoin for the first timeum so do you want to you want to startwith that bitcoin q ayeah so uh it's buying bitcoinsnever been easier than it is todaythere's uh exchanges popping up all overthe place every every man in this dogseems to beuh giving you the opportunity to to beable to buy bitcoin from within theirecosystem or their appumthe the kind of elephant in the roomunfortunately and uh is is the um knowyour customer or kyc is it's uh it'slovingly called within the spaceumkyc is a regulation that essentially anysort of businessentity that has a banking relationshiphas to abide by that kind of dictates umthat they must collect certain pieces ofinformation from anybody that they givea service to obviouslyin the context of bitcoin that's anexchange that sells you bitcoin fordollars pounds yen whatever yourjurisdiction isumso in practice that looks like if youlike go on the cash app and you try andsign up to cash app to buy bitcointhey require you to upload your id youraddressuh i'm not sure some some servicesrequire like a selfie um that's whatwe're talking about right here which isthis identification information that'srequired when you sign up to one ofthese regulated servicesright and some of these are some ofthese exchanges now are even doing uhvideos where you they take that like a3d scan of your face which is kind ofscary really andso with all that said why why is thatkind of um why is that sort of a badthing that that people like matt andmyself sort of try andumwarm people away from or at least paintthe dangers clearly for everybodyeverybody um so when you supply thisinformation to to be able to buy bitcoinin a you know a really sort of easy andstress free way you know cash apps agood example where you can just in acouple of clicks get some bitcoin into awallet that you controlbut one of the main problems is that youknow all of this information getsrounded up into a centralized databasethat's controlled bythe entity that you're doing businesswithum unfortunately these entities or someof these entities they won't toureverybody with the same brush um don'thave a great track record of uh securingit effectively umtalk about perfect timing we we heardabout um a hack with uh robin hoodyesterday was it it was seven millionusersseven million users uminformation has been leaked um nowthere's varying degrees of the severityof the leak some of it's just emailaddresses uh some of it's more personalinformation like banking details etcumyou know to name a few others equifaxfacebook t-mobile clubhouse linkedinuh coinbase ledger um all of thosecompanies umrequiresome form ofof your personal information to to dobusiness with them and and they've allhad hacks where again with varyingdegrees of severity that um somebodythat shouldn't have got their hands onyour information did so i'm you knowwhat we're not talking small fry heresome of these uh hacks were in to thetune of millions and millions of ofpeopleum now you know if that's something likefacebook and your uh email address getsleaked you know it's not really the endof the world it might piss you off alittle bitwhen you tie that into umsomething like bitcoin wherehopefully especially after you'velistened to this podcast and you're sortof securing your own wealth that mightbe uh in your house that might be in aloved one's house or a combination ofthoseif uh if if the wrong person was to gethold of this information you know yourselfie your home addressum indicate in the case of coinbase howmuch bitcoin you've actually boughtthat is umessentially painting a very large crosson your front door that ummight make it inviting to the wrong typeof people to come and pay you a visit tosee if they can relieve you of of thosesatsso that's one of the main umyou knowuh reasons that that i personally tryand sort of make people aware that yesgoing on to cash app or coinbase orwhatever is is you know they make itreally really simple they've got reallynice polished uis to to be able to goand umget some get your hands on some statswithin it within a couple of clicks umit'syou know one of the big big risks isthat this information is leaked on aregular basis and there are companies inspace that to their credit and haveyou know they've nev never umbeen fallen prey to one of these attacksand but unfortunately they do seem to becoming um more and more uh frequent umso yeahthat's one of the main risks with kyc soyeah i mean i would add a couple thingshere uh first of all even if you know acompany hasn't been compromised yet weshould basically operate under theassumption that they will be compromisedin the futureumthis information once it is taken isoften soldto other people as wellit can be combined with otherinformation that was leaked from otherdatabases so for instanceumif you know you you have the facebookleak and the facebook leak has yourmailing address in it and then you havethe ledger leak and your ledger leak hasyour email address in it but thefacebook link also had your emailaddress in it they can combine those twouh leaks to get your full email addressand your actual in-person addresssecond of all we've seen umwe've seen physical attacks happen topeople who were known bitcoiners and howmuch bitcoin they had uh sometimes itwas because of these leaks it's hard totell for sure sometimes it's becausepeople just talk about their bitcoin andhow much bitcoin they own which you alsoshouldn't doumthird of alluhthis information can obviously be usedagainst you by your own government itcan also be used against you by foreigngovernments in the future obviously itis painting a target as you are someonewho owns bitcoin and uses bitcoin andexactly how much bitcoin you haveuh and then fourth of all in thecoinbase league specificallyumall of your withdrawal history was alsoleaked so uh it can be used to trackyour future bitcoin transactions uhbased on that information and we will gofurther in onon bitcoin privacy and trade-offs ofbitcoin when using bitcoin trying to useit privately how to go about that inlater on in this episode but these arejust things to keep in mindright so you know all of which is issort of incredibly scary um and theother thing final thing odds aboutbefore we sort of look onto thealternatives is that you know umsomething that i like to sort of keep inmind and remind people is you knowbeing here for number go up is great youknow i'm not going to sit here and saythat um i don't like to see us hitall-time highs all the time um butbitcoin is also umcreated to be able to make thetransactions that they don't want you tomakenowif you're sort of uh tying all of yourbitcoin to your personal identity umyou're you're kind of putting a inyour armor before you've even startedthat you know if you do want to makethose purchases that umbitcoin allows you to make um due to itspseudonymity thenyou're sort of starting two steps backby tying your your bitcoin holdings toyour personal identity um which is wheresort of buying from a new kyc source itcomes in so that you can have umsome or hopefully you know in a perfectsituation all of the bitcoin that youownso before we get there before we getthere just one more thingkycthese records are forever once once youdo these records you have to assumethey're foreverum is it best practice to delete anaccountum i you know if you're no longer usingit yes but you should assume that actualdatabase record hasn't been deleted umand it might be used against you in thefuture um so these are things to keep inmind umnow let's move to okay so if you'retrying to avoid kyc you don't want touse one of these regulated services whatare your optionsright so the the sort of uh two mostcommon ones that kind of get bannedaround in terms of actually purchasingbitcoin um is bisque uh which is apeer-to-peer uh decentralized exchangewhere you essentially it's a maker takermodel where somebody will want to umsell some bitcoin and they will go on tobisque and they'll say you know i wantto sell uh x amount of bitcoin for thismuch um you know 500 whatever and andthen you as a buyer can go on to thatsort of uh peer-to-peer marketplace andand look for these offers to see onethat sort of fits your bill that youknow was is within your price range andyou know the amount that you want to buyyou can go on completely and honestanonymously and and sort of take theirtheir sell offer so that you can buythat amount of bitcoin from themumthis isbisqyep so it's an application that you justdownload onto your computer basicallyyou run it all locally uh you knowthere's no personal information youdon't need to show any id's to sign upthe only person again depending on thepayment method that you use you knowthere's many many payment methods umsome are better from a privacyperspective than others and but let'ssay you knowmost people are going to go on and andif they want to sort of be able to takea wider range of offers from you knowmore people across the world they'regoing to want to use the banking systemwhich you know might ring some alarmbells to some other people listening butumwhat also i say is what's worse issharing your banking information withone person who is very likely to wantvery likely to be a privacy preservingindividual because they you know theyprobably wouldn't be using bisqueotherwise versus uh the regulatedentities that throw all of yourinformation into a centralized honey potthat we've just explainedum so that's one way you know some ofthe more private options that areavailable on bisc umare sort of postal money orders whichyou know i don't really know great dealabout um because it's a u.s centricthing um but you've also got cash in themailand then there's various various otheroptions that are kind of uh relevant totheir sort of jurisdictionsumanother option as well is huddle huddlewhich worksquite similarly to the way i've justdescribed with bisc and the thedifference being is a huddle huddle iskind of a centralized company um thathosts uh the sort of buy and sell uhlocations for you you know it's awebsite huddlehuddle.comum where you can go and sort of makeoffers or you can take offers again inthe same fashion umso so there may be some uh other alarmbells are in game where thinking whereum well what happens if i go on tobiscor to huddle hollow um and i youknow take this buy offer and i sendsomebody some some you know us dollarsand what's to stop them from just neversending me the bitcoin so both of theseservices um work on what's called anescrow system where the seller will haveto deposit the bitcoin first into amulti-sig wallet that is controlled byum by the buyer the seller and the sortof centralized entity um so thatbasically they theyuh can't sort of run off uh once they'veyou know got hold of your dollarsbecause they have to deposit the bitcoinfirst and and you'll be notified to waituntil you send any of the payments sothat they've proved that they've sort ofdepositedthe bitcoin into that um there is stillsome risk there but it's a reduced riskyeah absolutely you knowit's kind of i would say it's more of agrief and attack than ayou're not really at risk of losingfunds it's more of a um going throughthe arbitration process to prove thatyou've sent the dollars so that you getthe bitcoin back in the end so it'sgonna be more of a headache more than arisk to to actually lose any uhany cash would you sayyeah more or less umsoyeahcontinue so some of the other options umif youuh you can buy from bitcoin atmsthere's a really great website calledcoinatm radar.comwhere you can go on and punch punchingyour physical location i would recommenddoing sousing a vpnand and it will tell you all of thebitcoin etms thatare in your local area the the generalpremise of these is that you uh walk upyou can deposit some cashuh give it a um bitcoin address uhhopefully from a wallet that you controlwhich we're going to come on to laterand the bitcoin will be depositeddirectly into that wallet that youcontroluh there are again as is always the casewith bitcoins from caveats um justbecause you're depositing cash doesn'timmediately make bitcoin atm superprivate depending on the umthe brand of atm machine that you usesome of them do still ask for id um butthat is uh distinguished on the websitei've just said which is callingatmradar.comright some ask for id and thenand then some ask for just a phonenumber some ask for bothyeah which and obviously the the onesthat just ask for the phone number arethe better ones because you can spoofthat with services like textverified.comwhere you can just get kind of a burnernumber uh to satisfy the atm's umuh you know phone number requirementsbut obviously that's not tied to to yourpersonal identityum and then before we continue before wecontinue since we're still like early inthe episode and i should have mentionedin the beginning uh bitcoin q a has uhmy favorite guides in the space so ifyou want to look up somethingspecifically or if you prefer readingum if you go to bitcoiner.guidehe has all of his guides listed there sojust keep that in mind okay continueyeah pretty much everything that we'retalking about i've got some uhsome form of information on it um soyeah moving on to other noko i seeopportunities um so we've covered uhpeer-to-peer peer-to-peer exchangeswe've covered atms and the the next sortof option is to uh is to earn it umwhich might sound a bit outlandish tosome people are new and entering thespace but also we'll say is thatumeverybody has some form of a uniqueskill um and there's always going to besomebody who needs umwhat you can offer them uh it's justabout sort of uh trying to build up abit of a reputation whether that's inyour local area or online and so thatyou canyou knowsell your time or your skills andknowledge um and receive satsin in in repayment for themand the other option again probably notas much of a beginner optionas i would like it to be but the otheroption is to mine itumalthough home mining does seem to begoing through somewhat of a renaissancewhich is really really great to see andso the the general premise of that isthat you canbuy a bitcoin miner you can plug thatinto your um outlet at home plug in anethernet port connect up to to a miningpool and stream yourself somesecret sats or some private no kyc satsuh directly again into your wallet thatyou control umthere's been you know a fair bit of foodbanded around that home mining is iskind oftoo difficult or it's too expensive umthe the thing i would say is that yeahit's very much dependent on yourelectricity prices um but again you knowthis this shows fairly us centric andthere's a lot of places in the u.s whereyou know and if you'reum earning anywhere less than i thinkyou knownails in the chat they'll probablycorrect me on this but i think you'reprofitable mine at the moment anywherebelow 30 sats 30 shots yeah so i meanwith with all of these techniques youmight be spending a little bit moremoney than you would beum if you went through one of theseregulated services um you'rethe way i justify it is i mean you'reyou're paying a little bit of a premiumfor privacyand you're paying that for privacy goingforward too so it keeps paying dividendsuh with mining specifically mining homemining is a fantastic wayuh in my opinion ofaccumulating kyc free setsumit's really nice because once you haveit plugged in it's just constantly goingyou don't even have to really thinkabout it just constantly bringing inmore sets um we already have two wholemining umcivil dispatches so if you go back ifyou go to civildispatch.comor if you go through the podcast feed orif you go to bitcointv.com and ourplaylist over there you can find thoseepisodes and we're about to have a thirdone too uhi think november 30th there's gonna be athird home mining episode so if that'ssomething that interests you you shouldgo check those out uh starting with thefirst one uh because we literally spentlike three hours on all the differenttrade-offs thereyeah just to come back on on somethingthat you said about um generallyspeaking you're absolutely right thatyou're gonna pay uma little bit more for uh noko ac satsyou know especially if you go to thepeer-to-peer exchangesum but i just i like to try and reframeit and you know it's not a a no kycpremium and the theprice that you see on a kyc exchange ilike to call it the um the discount thatyou get given um for giving up yourpersonal information and puttingyourself uh a little bit more at riskthan versus uh getting some sats thatare not tied to your identity so i thinkthat's like that useful framing yeah thereal price is the private way and thenexactly discount if you sacrifice yourprivacyum and then one method that you didn'tmention which isprobably the most uh accessible to newcoinersis if you have a friend or a couplefriends that are interested in bitcoinand they've been in bitcoin for a whileum obviously if you can if you can paythem cash for some of their bitcoinum that is the most private uhi wouldn't say the most private but it'sdefinitely the most accessible privateway for a new coinerand if they if they don't want to sellyou any they might know someone whowants to sell some soum that's always something to keep inmind cashin person isextremely gives you very good privacyguarantees periodumwhat else also like if you knowto the to the bitcoiners out therelistening to this uh showum you know guide your new cornerfriends in throughthat kind of method right and whether ornot you want to actually explicitly sellit to them that's one thing butyou know if you if you go out to dinnerhave them pay for dinner with their withtheir cash or their credit card and thenpay them back in bitcoin orgive them you know birthday gifts inbitcoin and like get them started in apeer-to-peer fashion rather than justthrowing them to the wolves and sendingthem to a regulated exchangeyeah there's a couple of people in thechat that have just uh rightfullyshouted out um as techo vouchers as welland which is essentially uh you'll getsort of stores uh that sort of sign upto become an azteco um sort of vendorand you can go in hand over some cashand you'll get sort of a voucher whereyou can go and claim the the equivalentamount of sats from that again directlyinto a wallet that you controlthe the the other caveat the sorry theonly caveat with azteco is that thethe sort of uh kyc responsibility if anyis put onto the specific vendor so itwon't just be you know don't justpresume that because there's an articleum vendor near you that it won't be nokyc uh each one is sort ofuh left to kind ofcome up with the their owninterpretation of whether they need todo it or not basicallyand you have that major chain in you inthe uk that's an azteca vendor rightwhat's the name of thatit was poundland but then it stopped acouple of months ago and it's showing nosigns of coming back unfortunately uhokay so as they realized what was goingon they're like ah we can't too muchliabilitywhich was a shame because they they havea store in literally every town therewas hundreds of them and it was massivefor the uk but yeah unfortunate to knowmore okay well that's a shame um if youwant toread more aboutthe dangers of kyc you can go to bitcoinq a's website no kyc only dot comumhowever you decide to proceed withobtaining bitcoin and accumulatingbitcoinum the next step istrying to secure it uhsecure it well and secure it in a waythat you don't have to trust a thirdparty uh who can seize your fundsum so how shouldhow should bitcoiners how should newcoiners go about that bitcoin q awhat are their optionsthe natural uh first step for mostpeople unfortunately like we've justsaid is is um a centralized exchangeagain like coinbase cash app or someonesomething like thatwhere you will go on deposit dollars oryour local currency they will uh sort ofcredit your account with you know theequivalent amount of statswhat you have there is um an iouwhere you've got an account with themwhere they say that you've got this muchbitcoin essentially what you actuallyhave in real terms is uh well it's aniou and you don't actually hold anybitcointhe the sort of uh very essence ofbitcoin is the uh that you know thatgoes to say you're not your keys notyour coins which is banded around a hellof a lot and for good reason and itessentially means that if you're notholding the keys for your bitcoin uh youdon't actually have any bitcoinso you bought someone in exchange um thethe next step would be to get yourselfum a mobile walletwhere you can uh generate the keys uhwithin that wallet um so that your youand only you are in control of uh any ofthe bitcoin that you send to that walletum so before we before we move on andi'm sorry that i keep cutting you off ii hope i hope it's uh fine with youbefore you move on umso so the risk is if you're holding itif you're holding it in one of thesecustodial wallets which is what theexchanges default toum and there's some other services thatalso are custodial walletsumbasically the telltale sign of that isthe way you access it is through ausername and passwordumyou don't have any backup yourself whathappens there is there's a highlikelihood that your account could getfrozen we've seen that with paypal inthe past with fiat with just us dollarswhere paypal will freeze your accountand you're not able to get your moneyum it could be stolen if the exchangegets compromised or the custodial walletgets compromisedum and obviously you're trusting yourprivacy completely with the custodianbecause they know all of yourtransactions and your current balancesso it's not idealum and you want to learn how to holdbitcoin yourself becauseone of the revolutionary things aboutbitcoin is that you can hold it yourselfin a way thatumsomeone has to physically compromise youuh to to take your bitcoinum soi guess you're about to start withmobile wallets i think mobile walletsare the most accessible way getting awallet on your phone basicallyum to hold your bitcoin for you rightyeah just before i get down to themobile wallet it comes back to the pointi made earlier about censorshipresistant or being able to make thepayments thatum you know you want to make not thatthey give you permission to to make umif you've got to uh ask for permissionfrom an exchange to be able to sendbitcoin to your desired destination umyou know you're asking for permissionand you know that's not why we're herewe want to be able to spend our money towhoever we want whenever we want sofirst step and the easiest step is toget a phone wallet you know they're freethey're easy to access you know you candownload from any popular app store orquite a lot of them offer umdirect downloads so that you canuh download from the the you know thechosen teams umwebsite or or github umthe a lot of people tend to rush in andtry and buy um you know the next besthardware wallet straight away whenthey've just bought sort of 100 ofbitcoin to dip their toes in a littlebitwell if you you know if you're justdipping your toes in to see if thisthing's uh working for you then itdoesn't make any sense to you know goout and buy a hardware wallet and thisis coming for somebody who works for ahardware wallet company um it doesn'tmake any sense to go out rush out andbuy acouple hundred dollars on a hardwarewallet when you own less than that inbitcoin so that's why you already have aperfectly good phone that you carryaround with you it's very easy to spendand receive fromum but the important thing here is thatyou use a reputable mobile walletthere's a lot of scammy mobile walletsdon't just open up the app store andsearch for bitcoin wallet you will get alot of bad options thereyeah the the unfortunately the the top10 um results for that sort of search inmost of the app stores are quite abysmalmy personal recommendations would besamurai wallet if you're an android useruh or blue wallet or if you're an iosuser uh moon wallet is also another onethat i know you're pretty bullish onthat as well yeah both blue wallet andmoon wallet that's with 2us m-u-u-n areavailable on both android and iosumthey'rethey're very easy to use for beginnersuh i i would say they're not veryintimidating umso don't be intimidated you shoulddownload one just try itso the the kind of general premise ofthese and unfortunately i mentioned moonwallet there it's gonna umit's gonna book the trend of what i'mabout to say but the general premise isyou'll download the app from your chosenlocation uh the the app when you set upa new wallet the app will show you alist of 12 or 24 words which is yourmaster secret um you know which is thethe master backup to your to yourbitcoin wallet anybody that gets theirhands on that and be that physically ordigitally um is going to be able to takeall of your fundsso make sure that you write that downand secure it somewhere um safe andthenso moon wallet has a different backupmethod um it'll prompt you and explainhow to back up that butwe will focus on this standard which issomething we call seed words which isthey're basically these wordsit's a phraseand the wallet generates it for you andyou need to keep them secret youabsolutely need to keep them secret soyou don't want to put them on aninternet connected device you put themon you don't want to like save them inyour icloud notes folder you don't wantto take a screenshot and upload it toicloud what you want to do is at thebare minimum you want to write it downon a piece of paper double check thatyou wrote it down correctly store itsomewhere securely because if someonegets access to it they have access toyour funds but as long as you have thosewordsyour phone you could drop your phone inthe toilet it could fall you know itcould fall and crack and break or justcompletely justyou know some phones just like stopworking sometimesas long as you have those seed words youcan reinstall the app on a new deviceand just put in those words put in thatphrase words and you will have access toyour fundsyeah and the beauty of that is like yousaid most of the you know 99 of thewallets umin the space all sort of work to thatsame standard so you know you wouldn'tnecessarily have to even uhdownload the exact same mobile wallet aslong as the mobile wallet that youchoose umit abides by the rules which again mostof them do then you can sort of put thatseed phrase into into any other walletand there's a quick question in the chatwhich i think is probably good to touchon before we move on to hardware walletsandsomebody asked how much would you needto own to get a hardware walletnow obviously i'm not going to be ableto answer that for the for everybodythat that's watching you know it's quitean individual questionand all i would say is you knowif it's yourthe only mobile wallet you've gottenit's on your daily phone i would use theequivalent of how much cash would youphysical cash would you carry aroundwith you um you know what's your limitat which it's gonna start um affectingyour life if you used to lose thatbalance umthe quick review the mobile wallet themobile wallet should be like almostconsideredis is like your spending wallet what youwould have right inin in your back pocket but uhgoing further when we go into moremethods of storing your bitcoin thatwould be more like a savings accountum except i you're about to say a caveatuh i mean i have my own caveat i wouldsayi thinkespecially if you're using a reputableonei think people can feel a little bitmore comfortable than the kind of amountof cash they would carry in their pocketum i know like i wouldn't feel morecomfortable i wouldn't feel thatcomfortable carrying more than like 400in my pocketum but like a mobile wallet especiallyif it's your first wallet you're justgetting started you're gettingcomfortable you have your seed wordsbacked upuh your phone's up to dateyou know we don't seehacks are theoretically possibleobviously phones get compromised all thetimeumbut i i would probably if i had to picka number i'd like being like the 5 000to 10 000 rangelike that's where you start having toreallyconsider securing it moreum and you should also operate under theassumption because bitcoin tends togo up fastumyou should be prepared ahead of timebecause it could beyou know it could be a thousand dollarsin there and then in six months it couldbe worth eight thousand dollarsyeah the the other thing i would say aswell is that thisalmost everybody has got a spare phonelying around at the house that you knowyou could use that as your sort ofdedicated bitcoin phone and where youcouldbe slightly more comfortable storing youknow maybe larger amountsrelative to the individual and and thenyou could kind of decant off into yoursort of daily phone what you might wantto spend on a day-to-day basisabsolutely nothing wrong with thatapproach as well if you didn't want toand shell out quickly for for umfor a hardware wallet which we can wecan come on to now and so hardwarewallet is well before we get to hardwarewallets you also havethere's also software wallets on on thecomputer that you can haveright so you have mobile wallets youhave software wallets on your computerwhere it's like you install an app onyour computerumi i mean i would saylike unless you're an advanced user andyou have like a dedicated computer andthis episode isn't for advanced usersthey should probably shy away from thatin the beginning i i think the mobilesecurity model is a stronger securitymodel as you know as long as you're notworried about like the nsa or somethingum or like the chinese intelligenceservicesor these intelligence services um mostmost of the population uh are not greatat securing their their computer uh mostpeople's computers are unless you'resort ofa bit of a hacker man there's this youknow a far more vulnerable device thanyour mobile phone iswhich is why like you said you know icompletely agree that i don't recommendthem especially for larger amounts umand i tend to sort of skip straight tothe hardware wallet after the mobilewallet stageumsohardware wallets um are essentially adedicated uh physical deviceum designed to manage the the keys thatcontrol your bitcoin um so with thembeing a a physical dedicated device youknow their one purpose is to secure yourbitcoin whereas your phone hasyou know it's essentially a computer inyour pocket and with all of that extrafunctionality that your phone hascompared to a hardware walletincreases the theoretical attack vectorswhere hackers orthe nsa whoever can umsort of try and attempt to get theirhands on your bitcoin so these devicesare very focused andthey're focused at securing your bitcoinfrom physical attack um and also uh fromum digital attack ie uh you knowsomebody stealing your keys um over theinternet if you were to connect one ofthese devices to your uhvery likely highly insecure computerumso they a lot of them most of the goodones um work uh you know that theirprimary umway of of sort of keeping things secureis that they operate with what's knownas an air gap where they they canoperate without being connectedphysically to to any other device andbecauseit's that physical umconnection that sometimes can introduceuh uh intro um extrathreat factors so the the idea just todistill it here like the idea of ahardware wallet is that you have aa device that's builtto securely hold your bitcoin welltechnically it's holding the keys toyour bitcoinum butfor all intents and purposes it's it'syou can think of it as holding yourbitcoin and and it interacts with eitheryour computer or your phone in a waythat those keysall the keys are what protect yourbitcoin gives you access to bitcoin andyou don't want someone else to haveaccess to those keys it keeps those keysoff that computer or off that phone soit stays on the deviceand that device is never connected tothe internet sothethe basic concept behind securingyour stash with a hardware wallet isthatuh for someone to compromise you theyneed to physically have access to youand the device orif they can compromise the device justthe device but they like have to comeinto your home or come into your officeand get that device rather than hackingyou through the internetright and you know the even um if ageneric attacker was togain physical access to to most of thesedevices and they're still going to um afair bit of time and a hell of a lot ofequipment to be able to um you knowcrack theum protections on the device to be abletoaccess the keys um and to be able tosteal your bitcoin so it's not just acase of umprotecting you from a malware infestedcomputer um if somebody was to break inthere's still pin protection on thedevice and so it's not just a case ifyou lose the device um and you loseaccess to your bitcoin again the thepremise that matt spoke about beforeabout writing down your seed words um isexactly the same with a hardware walletuh the differences here is that um thethe when you sort of uh generate thosethose 24 or 12 words and it's done in anoffline environment that's never beenconnected to the internet so that againit just removes that extra threat vectorwhere um you're not connected to anysort ofinternet connected devices so it's justthat extra layer or wrapper of securityperfectumshould wewhat is your favorite hardware walleti saw that one coming a mile offum so full disclosure um i work for a umhardware wallet manufacturer calledfoundation devicesand obvious biases aside i genuinelybelieve that we make the umthe best option for a beginner enteringthe space umit's incredibly secure but also veryeasy to operate uh so i should havenamed the devices called passport andand another great device is the callcard umwhich is probably looks a little bitscarier to the newcomer i would say umbut has some extra features um thatmight bemore beneficial for more advanced usersthat they could sort of leverage sothose would be my two favorites yeah iwould say my favorite is uh cold cardumi've used multiple versions of coldcards i highly recommend them umand then ifwe're not really going to go intocoins here but if youabsolutely need to gamble onother coins in the space rather thanjust bitcoin uh both foundation and coldcard are bitcoin onlyumi mean so i i would say either use aledger or a treasureuh hardware wallet if if you wantcoin support um but even in thatsituation you probably shouldgo with a bitcoin only hardware walletfor your bitcoin and then use the otherones for your coins and just likethe mobile wallets there are lots ofreally bad harder wallets out thereso don't just googlebest hardware wallet because a lot ofinfluencers are paidtopromote them so you'll see youtubevideos with 500 000 views saying to usea horrible hardware wallet soconsider thatyeah what i would say just to back thatup again is that you know likelihood isif you're listening to this that you'reat least aware um ofyou know bitcoin twitter and the peoplethat are umaround and popular on there and most ofthose people have been around for a goodnumber of years and they've probablytried all of these devices so look towhat most most of theirmost of those people are using or atleast recommended and when you're sortof doing your own research to see whichdevice is going to be best for youperfectumwhen they're using their hardware walletthey need to use it with awith software they need to use it withan appso what are your recommendations forwhich apps they should use with theirhardware walletthe best two for meif you want to stay on desktop whichgenerally gives you sort of a little bitmore extra functionality would be numberone be spiral wallet um hands down myfavorite umor if you like a little bit of a sort ofeasier to to operate interface with kindof lessadvanced features spectre desktop isalso a great onetwo great recommendations spectre usedto be my favorite now sparrow's myfavoriteyeah um whichmight uh be a good segue for what we'vegot coming up next uh well before we getthereyou can also useyou can also use both the cold card andthe foundation passport with blue walleton mobile so if youare going through the steps and you gotcomfortable with blue wallet alreadyum because you started with a mobilewallet uh you can then use blue walletwith both of those hardware walletswhich is nice especially i mean i ithink some people listening to thisprobably don't have a computer that'sso a lot of people don't have computersthey just have the computer in theirpocketyeah you know we're heading towards amobile first world aren't we if not ifwe're not already there and blue walletdoesoffer a great interface uh especially uhwith with the with the passport with theqr interfaces uh very very slick andvery easy to wrap your head around as abeginnerawesome okay so you want to go to thenext topicyou said yeah let'slet's hit nodes yeah so i talked aboutum inspector desktop and one of thegreat features about like the desktop isit actually has a built-in bitcoin nodeso uh the next step along your journeyuh hopefully will be to look to run yourown bitcoin nodeum a bitcoin node is you can look at itas your umsort of interface into your into thebitcoin world and it's going to be thatnext step along the sovereignty journeyso that you can and again one of the thebuzz phrases that you hear in the spaceis verify your own transactionsand so when you receive uh any bitcointransactionand that will bebeing passed to you via a whole networkof nodesand the wallet that you choose to usewill be connected to a node now thatnode could be uma centralized node or operated by anexchange uh it could bea node that you don't know who existsthat might actually be a chainsurveillance company or hopefully itcould be your own node that you can runum in your house relatively cheaplynow the benefits of of running your ownnode like i said is you can verify yourown transactions so that you can be surewhen somebody's sending you atransaction and that the transactionabides bythe this sort of rule set umthat the the network that you've chosento join umthat we all agree on uh to put that alittle bit simplea little bit simpler is that you canbe sure that sort of nobody's trying tocheat you and send you some fake bitcoinor a transaction that's not valid and sothat you know you might be selling goodsor services and they might be paying youin bitcoin for thatandand if you weren't verifying your owntransactions they might be able to umsend you um the way i like to frame itis it's using your own note to interactwith the bitcoin network you have to usea node and if you don't use your ownnodeumyou don't have counterfeit detection isis like kind of how i like to view itsomeone can kind of trick youuh into it into thinking you havebitcoin when you don't have bitcoin soyou want to use your own node for thatpurpose and then second of all which ithink is almost more tangible to peoplebecause to be honest uh we haven't seenthat's more of a theoretical attack andwe haven't really seen it play out itcould still play out in the future youshould assume it it will so you want touse your own node for counterfeitdetection but second of all it alsoif you don't use your own node um you'retrusting your privacy with whoever'snode you're using so you want to useyour own node so that you don't have totrusta potential potentially a stranger or acompanywith that that private transactioninformation and balance informationyeah it's about removing trustessentially and and by running your ownnode you're you're putting the trust inthe hardware and or the the softwarethat you are choosing to run uh not theone that's kind of been given to you ifyou're operating with an exchange or acentralized node runner and so there'suma a massive awash of choice and withvarying degrees oftechnical abilitythe the easiest way to get running withyour own nodeis to download a piece of softwarecalled bitcoin corethis is kind of the the sort of uh defacto software built by the the bitcoincore developers uh that is essentially apiece of software that you can in acouple of clicks download onto yourlaptop or desktop and and it will startto download the your own copy of theblockchain so that you can umtransact with the built-in wallet andto just to get started and verify yourown transaction that way that'sabsolutely the easiest way and as itouched on earlier uh spectre desktopactually has umessentially that built in as well justpackaged in a slightly different way foryou and so they're they're absolutelyfree and within a couple of clicksyou'll be on the way to downloading yourown copy of the blockchain and havingyour own node set upthe problem with a setup like that isthat umyou i can't really um generally speakingconnect any mobile wallets to it so ifyou were to want to transact when you'reout and about and you run bitcoin coreon your laptopand you wanted to send the transactionthe likelihood is you're not gonna haveyour laptop with you so you you know youwon't be able to to spend as easily assome of the node options that we'regoing to come up come on to uh in asecond i'll just pause see if matt's gotanything to add thereumyeah so i mean if you're using bitcoincore or if you're using the built-inbitcoin core inspectoruh yeah correct your you can't the mainnegative is you can't use it with themobile wallet the also the othernegative isum your transaction and balance infowill be on your computer so if it'sa computer you use for work or acomputer you use uhto play games or look at porn orsomething like that your social mediahabitit might be easily compromised and thatbecomes a it becomes mostly it becomes aprivacy issueumbecause all your transaction historywill be there and all of your balancehistory will be thereum but also you can't use it with mobilewallets which is a key component as wellyeah so so the next best option um andunfortunately the most expensive optionis what's known as a plug and play nodeso this is where you'll buyessentially a small box from one of thevarious teamsto name a few we've got uh ronin dojowe've got raspi blitz we've got startnine uh umbrell there's loads ofdifferent companies or my nodeno nothere's loads popping up um all withdifferent feature sets but essentiallythey sell your boxuh that you plug in at home you plug itinto your router you plug it into thepower outletand then within a couple of clicksyou're off and running again to to getyour own copy of the blockchain and haveyour no your own node up and runningand before we move on uh civil dispatchuhcivil dispatch 26i had all the major node teams on for aconversation ontheir node projects so if you'reinterested in having one of thesepurpose-built boxes or you a lot ofthose projects that were just namedallow you to actually buy the hardwareseparatelyand then install their software on it umconsider listening to that sill dispatchright so and the the kind of finaloption is the diy approach like matt'sjust touched on where all of theprojects that we just said and we'llhave a parts list you can go away andbuyspend a couple hundred dollars buying ahard drive and a single board computerand a couple of other cablesand build your own node and put your ownsoftware well put the software thatthese teams provideand onto that hardware uh the the endresult is that you get um the same nodewith all the same features um obviouslythe caveat is that you've got to gothrough the process of buying thehardware yourself flashing the softwareand onto a micro sd card uh which mightcause you some you know if you're a lesstechnical user and you're lesscomfortable with taking that approachand that's why the teams offer theplug-and-play note it does sound moreintimidating than it actually isand i would absolutelyso like i encourage new users to gettheir feet wet um also juston thejust to go back a little bit aboutbitcoin core i mean if you're using youcan use you can also use bitcoin core ifyou're running bitcoin core on the samecomputer you're running spectre on or asparrow they both can connect to itumif you do that process you really shouldbe using it on a dedicated computer iknow i like kind of touched on thatearlier when i said you know if you'reusing it for playing games or socialmediait could get compromised easier becauseyou're using it for all these othergeneral purposes you're downloadingsoftware on it that maybe you haven'tverified you definitely haven't verifiedand have no idea what's really runningthereum so if you are going to go thatapproachyou should have a dedicated device youshould consider a dedicated computer adedicated phone that you are using withit um and uhyeah in general dedicated devices areare going to be more secure and moreprivate you'rewhen we when we talk about security andbitcoin land whereyou don't don't let perfect be the enemyof good don't get overwhelmed becauseyour setup's not perfect but at the sametime you're just trying toreduce your threats so that you're notthe lowest hanging fruit most of thetime when we see these hacks it'stargeted at the people that are mostvulnerableyeah and the just to go back to the diyapproach that was outlining umall of these uh different projects thatwe've spoken about have got reallyreally good documentation and quitevibrant communities as well uh ontwitter telegram or their own dedicatedforum and so don't be afraid to you knowgo and have a browser the documentationlike matt said it's not actually asscary as i made it sound um and also youknow go and ask some questions in the inthe telegram chat or in the slack orwhatever you know um chat room that thethe the project has gotum you'll probably find or you'lldefinitely find thatall of these the people that are inthese communities are really welcomingand they've definitely been in yourposition before now and and you knowthey they found uh the thought of thisreally scary a couple of years ago andyou know now they might be runningseveral diy notes so they'll be don't beoff-put by it100um i will echo that sentiment i wouldjust add a slight caveat that there arescammers in these telegram groups andthese chat rooms um they will often tryand impersonateuhpeople that are involved with theproject or other notable figures to tryand get you feel comfortable never nevergive anybody uh your seed words thosesecret backup boards never give themtheir secret backup boardsand you know always be skeptical ifsomeone in one of those groups tries todm you separately and tries to go into aprivate chat you know sometimes it islegit but you need to be extra cautiousin that type of situationyeah and and if somebody does don't beafraid to ask in in the sort of mainroom you know tag the person who youthink might have dmd you and said isthat his issue at the mme exactly butalways uh just act on the the on air onthe side of caution and and keep thatsort of adversarial mindset to think youknow why is this person reaching out tome completely out of the blue after ijust asked my first question enteringthe room100um so all those node projectssupport something called electrum serverand electrum server is a standardumit's it's a standard way to interactwith your own node um you can use thoseelectrum server details and then you canput them into sparrowyou can put them into many of the mobilewallets that we mentioned earlier youcan put them into blue walletwith samurai specificallythey don't use electrum server they usesomething calleddojoand with that pairing is as simple asthere's a qr code and you just scan theqr code with your samurai wallet on yourphone and it'll pair up with your nodeyeah the good thing is with dojo as wellis it's uh implemented in the vastmajority of the the note packages nowthere's there's more that have dojo thatthen don't which is really great to seeindeedshould we hit on the coin joinokay soi i just want you know we're we're anhour inum if you're a newcomer you just listento this hour and you're intimidated as uh don't be intimidated you knowstart with step one where we talkedabout acquiring your bitcoinumthen you know learn how to hold your ownkeys and slowly move through the processdon't you know freak yourself out thatyou know now now i gotta run a node toolike i'm now i'm really intimidated youknow step by step get your feet wet getcomfortable send transactions receivetransactions back up your wallet restoreyour wallet just get comfortable with itget used to it don't it's not somethingto be scared of it's something that youlearn by doingyeah i uh i put a tweet a couple ofweeks ago actually that kind of echoesthat that you know if uh sending atransaction uh makes you feel a littlebit uneasy then you haven't sent enoughtransactions um you can see on screenthere that the mempool is uh you knowit's a little bit busy than what it wasbut a couple of sats per bite is goingto get your transaction confirmed veryquickly and that's going to cost you youknow less than a dollar to send atransaction so we don't have we don'thave that on the list but before we moveon to coin join on chain privacyutxo management we should probablyhow does how does a newcomer choose whatfee to pay they open up their walletthey go to send a transactionumwhat like how do bitcoin transactionfees work i feel like that is somethingwe tend to gloss overyeah we overlooked that one um wellfortunately most of the the good mobilewallets especially the ones that we'veuh mentioned uh on tonight's stream uhwill give you a couple of options uhwhere you canum you'll they'll either have you knowthree options sort of low prioritymedium priority and high priority likeagain like we can see on screen or theremight be a slider where you can manuallyadjust the feeand essentially the the higher that thefee you pay the more likely that uh yourtransaction is going to be uh confirmedor processed quickeruh againa caveat with that one we've got a lotof caveats tonight is that umthe uh some of the estimation the feeestimations umthese wallets all use different sort ofalgorithms as to how they um calculateor estimate the fee that would berequired to get you confirmed in thedisplayed priorityso matt's got on screen here a reallygreatwebsite called mempool.spaceum which can it shows you again the thepriority uh fee selections uh or what itwould adviseand based on uh correct me from wronggame map but based on what's currentlyin the mempool um as well as sort ofhistorical data as well so it's kind ofaalways a really good sort of accuratelook at you know if you want to get yourtransaction processed within the nextblock uh right now it would take anestimate of 13 sats per byte um butagain there's a little caveat here thatthere's still umtransactions with much lower transactionfees umthan 13 sats per byte that will also getget confirmed so it's kind of umit's not an exact science uh i will saythatbut multiple sources is always a goodone if you want to try and uhget it sort of nailed so i mean bitcoinis a run by a companybitcoin is adistributed networkum and so as a result how bitcointransactions workiswe have this chain of transactionsand the transactions are within blockswe call them blocksumroughly every 10 minutes there'll be anew bitcoin block and it will havefinalized transactions included in thatblockuntil you get into a blockyou sit in a waiting list that waitinglistis we call that the mempool we call itamenpool technically every node hastheir own mempoolumbut if your internet connection is solidin most situations those mempools shouldall look the same so when you go tomempool.space you're looking at theirmempool that will look very similar toif you looked at the same thing on yourown node which a lot of these nodeprojects by the way allow you to runmempool.space natively with your ownnodesothebasically you have this like free marketthat's constantly going on where you'redecide wherepeople are choosing which fee they'rewilling to spend and miners are going tousuallyinclude you in a block based on yourorder in that waiting list based on howmuch you want to spendso if it's a transaction between someoneyou trust um and you're willing to waita longer period of time you can pay alower fee if you're sending just toyourself you can pay the lowest fee wecall that's one sap per byte is thelowest fee because you're just sendingit to yourselfum you know if if in some crazysituation where a one sapper by nevergets confirmed ever which we've neverbeen through you can always resend thattransactionso you're gonna want touh choose your transaction fee based onthe urgency you want that transactionfinalized on the networkand most good wallets will basicallygive you a low medium and highyou knowthislow being i can wait medium being likei'm in the middle ground because it'smedium and high being i don't want towait i want it finalized as soon aspossibleyeah andit'sit's a very much a dynamic thing it'slike a queue that's always evolvingevery single second because there's moreand more transactions being sent youknow every second andumit's not within you know outside therealms of possibility thatwhat the fee that you put up right thissecondmight not be enough to get youimmediately uh processed into the nextblock in sort of five minutes timeum so it's it's very very dynamic andyou know that's why i said it's not sortof an exact science so generallyspeaking for most people the walletestimators are pretty good especially ifit's an urgent transaction that you needto be processedimmediately100 i'm glad we covered that topicum also uhjust uh before we move on to the nexttopic just to jump backwith hardware wallets uhyou know the backup to that hardwarewallet are those words you wrote downumyou have the option of putting them intosteel these steel plates are availablemany different vendors offer the steelplatesand the idea there is if you put it intosteel obviously it's going to be waterresistant and fire resistant it's goingto be more sturdy than paperyou might also consider makingduplicates of those seed words andhaving them in different places so likeif your office burns down or your houseburns down it's still in the otherlocationwith the caveat that it meansit could be more likely that someoneelse finds it because it's in morelocations so you need to think aboutthat very carefullyand then third of all with hardwarewallets which i forgot to mentionone thing i like to tell new coinersis it's a good idea to have to buy twoof whatever you decide to buybecause if you have a second oneyou canyou can have the same backup wordsinitialized on both devicesso then if something happens to yourdevice not only do you have the seedwords available those those secretbackup words available to restore yourdevice you also have the second devicethat still has access to your funds soyou're not in a panic situationum so i always i tend to recommend topeople that they should buy two of thesame device whichever they choose umso that they they can have twoinitialize and you can keep those inseparate locations as wellif you wantokay yeah i think that's good adviceso when you're opening up a bitcoinwallet it shows a balanceum a common misconception isthatthat you know you just it shows yourbitcoin balance that's what's in yourwallet but in reality what's in yourwallet is basically a bunch of differentbitcoin transactions that all add up tothat balanceum we call those utxos uhthose those are unspent transactionoutputs utxos is what we call them youcan think of them like bills in yourwallet like maybe your wallet you knowyour cash wallet has50 in it but in reality it has two 20sand a 10and that's how bitcoin wallets work soyou have all these small utxos in therethat add up to your balance and that hasprivacy implicationsbecause ififtwo of those utxos come togetherum in a single transaction they'reobviously linked on this chainuh forever right we call it theblockchain it's this ledger oftransactions they'll be linked togetherbecause they were both spent in the sametransactionso that brings us to this idea of utxomanagementand coin control the idea oftrying tomanage thosebitcoin transactions in a privacy andcost effective way should you want to gointo that a little bityeah definitely um and quick i willstart with the two wallets that we keepmentioning blue wallet and samurai umoffer all the features that i'm justabout to cover that sort of help when itwhen it comes to to utxo managementandinspectoryeah sorry yeah i keep referring tomobile wallets but yeah the all of thedesktop uh the good desktop wallets thatwe've spoken about i've all got utxomanagement features as well um sothere's a couple of facets to it thefirst one is the ability to uh label thethe utxos or the pieces of bitcoin thatyou've got in your wallet so what wouldbe an example of a label might be thatif matt was to pay me for dinner uh orpay me back for dinner um when ireceived that transaction into my walleti could put a label on that to say thatthat's come from martin it was fordinnerum i could then receive my wages from myemployerumand i could put the the relevant labelon that just to know that where theorigin uhof that utxo is fromumso the once i've labeled themwhen i'm making future transactionsand i'mthere's two ways you can make atransaction you can let the wallet toconstruct it for you automatically whichthey might choose any random utxos andmerge them together again like matt saidto which will show common ownership thatmight not be a problem however if you uhwant to preserve your privacy and imight not want my employer to know thati'm friends with matt because he's a badperson um because i've labeled those i'mnot a bad person thoughbecause i play radical[Music]because i've labeled those utxos when ireceived them at the time um in you knowtwo weeks down the line when i'm goingto make a transaction um i can then chyou know consider and the person thati'm paying you know do i want them toknow that i know matt or do i want themto know that i work for the company thatpaid me uh with this utxo i can makethat informed decision then to say wellactually i'm just going to spend fromone of those pieces of bitcoin oractually it's not a bad thing matt's notreally a bad person i'm gonna combinethe two uh because the value that i wantto send i need to combine the twoum so those are the two two sort of mainfacets to it and and but obviously youcan't ummake a an informed decision when youcome to spend um if you don't know theorigins of all of the etxos that you'vegot and so they kind of go hand in handreally um you need to label so that whenyou come to spend you can make theinformed decision as to whether youshould merge or not yeah so a key aspectof bitcoin isif someone sends you bitcointhey can see where that bitcoin goes inthe futureand if you receive bitcoin you can seewhere that bitcoin came from in the pastsothis is why labeling is importantbecause you want to knowwhere that transaction came fromor it goes tobecausethat's who you're exposing your privacyto in that situationis that a good yeah installation yeahwhich you know um might not be a problemfor you know the person that i'm payingmight not um be able toor be clever enough to to use blockchainanalysis um but the other sort of umadversary that we need to consider hereis chain analysis firms that might betrying to umcluster or monitor your unchain activitywho you're spending to who you'regetting change back from uh to monitoryour habits to try and um piece togetherumyou know the identity because theblockchain doesn't have any identitiesat that at the blockchain layer um butthese companies work to kind oftie all the pieces together so that theycan um de-anonymize people and so it'snot just a case of umyou know hiding how much you earn fromyour friend uh it's also you know thesemore sophisticated actors that have gotmore a lot more resources to throw atthis and that you've also got to bear inmind as well unfortunately yeah you bothyou both don't want you don't want youremployer to knowwhat you're spending things onand you don't want the guy who sells youa sandwich to know how much money youmakebut on top of that we also have theseprofessional surveillance mercenariesthat work for governments dictators andcompaniesand they are just out there constantlytrying to track bitcoin transactions soyou also have that as a concernwhich leads us nicely onto coinjoin ithink if unless there's anything elseyou want to touch on no let's yep we cantalk about coinjoin now so coinjoin umis um acoordinated or collaborative transactionwhereyou and at least one other personwillcollaborate to construct the transactionthat casts some doubtas to theorigin and the output of the transactionto umto make suream thatstill could you still hear mei can still hear you yes oh sorry ithought i dropped out yes it's acoinjoin is a collaborative transactionwhere umthe the idea is that theuh somebody watching the blockchainagain chain surveillance firm youremployer your friend whoever they can'tumdeterministically orwith good probability be able to trackthepeople on the input side of thetransaction to the output side of thetransactionso it effectively attempts to put upsort of um a brick wall in your you knowthe the utxos history so that umanybody looking on chain can't be sure100umyou know is there one person involved inthis transaction is there 10 peopleinvolved in this transaction it justcasts doubt on the the uh path that thebitcoin has taken and and who sort of umyou know has the bitcoin change handshasn't it we we're not really sure so sotracking bitcoin is a probability gameumthese surveillance companies and theirtools will basically or just someonewho's curious and trying to spy on youum will basically assign a probabilityto every transaction if ownership haschanged because one of the things aboutbitcoin isyou know i could send bitcoin to myselfor i could send it to bitcoin q a anduh the chain doesn't delineate betweenthat so a key aspect of tracking bitcointransactions isumdetermining some kind of probabilitythat bitcoin actually changed hands andthen from there trying to seewhich hands it went from from who to whoum so coinjoin is this idea of acollaborative transaction and you canthink of it likeumjust for an example if you have fivepeople that are doing a coin jointtogetherinstead of uh having a simple path thatyou're following on chain and decidingif ownership has changed um all of asudden there's five different potentialpaths it could go downyou don't know which of the five peoplethat participatedwhich of their five outputs are themso it breaks that probability chainand it's a useful tool in terms oftrying torecr to have forward privacy have thisidea of someone who sent you bitcoindoesn't necessarily know which path yourbitcoin took going forwardyeah and specifically with umimplementations of coinjoin likewhirlpool which are known as equaloutput coin joints um the the the sortof notion is that everybody um on theoutput side all of the utx on the outputside of the transactionlook absolutely identical and soit's kind of uh i always like to use theanalogy of v for vendetta where you'vegot the million mask marchit's essentially the same thing but onthe blockchain where all of these utxosare indistinguishable from one anotherand so like matt said you've got someforward privacyand be quickand soi the the three major coin jointprojects our samurai whirlpool joinedmarket in wasabiumcitadel dispatch 15 was with the wasabiteam civil dispatch 16was with the join market teamand civil dispatchi don't know where he is i also did asamurai oneum is citadel dispatchit's there in your feed somewhere youknow uhstefan can just rattle them off he knowsexactly which one is which always amazesme that umi don't know which one it is i'll comeback to it and tell you but it's there'sthere's another dispatch with thesamurai team so if you're interested inthis uh consider going back andlistening to those threeumme and bitcoin q auh like samurai whirlpool the best youcan also you you don't have to usesamurai walla with it you can usesparrow wallet with it as wellumyeah yeah co-sign that samurai orsparrow a hands-down win is for me umespecially from a from a beginner'sperspective um definitely the easiestones to get started with in my opinionyou can continue on i'm trying to figureout which dispatchi'lli'll cover off one quick question that'sum quite on topic and somebody askedwhat's the difference betweenum coinjoin that we've just spoken abouton a coin tumbler so the unfortunatelythe words uh or the the meanings havebeen kind of umwhitewashed somewhat over the years butum generally speaking a coin tumbler isa centralized service where you willhave tosend inyour bitcoin and give up a custody of itto whoever's running the tumbler andthey will send you somebody else'sbitcoin backand i absolutely wouldn't recommendanybody use thesebecause you're putting yourselfum completely in the hands of whoever'srunning the tumbler and that you knowwhether they're going to send you yourbitcoin back or notand yeah soand you also not only you're trustingthem with your bitcoin if you use acustodial mixer it's the same ideas ascustodyum because custodial risks with walletsum you're also you're trusting them withyour privacy and your fundsum so the key aspect of coinjoin is isthe idea that you are reducing trust inany kind of centralized third party umwasabi and samurai have a centralizedserver that they doum[Music]that they use to coordinate the coinjoins to make them easier better uxuh and more reliablethose coordinators are blindedwith samurai specifically you can use itwithout your own node and then you'retrusting samurai's node so that goesback to our earlier conversation aboutusing your own node you should use yourown node when you use samuraiotherwise you are trusting them withyour transaction and balance informationas as is the case with all light walletsum i found it so so it's still dispatch15 is wasabi still dispatch 16 is joinedmarket and still dispatch 30 is samuraiso consider listening to thoseokay i think are we done on coinjsshould we move on to the next topic um ihave multisig as the next topic butshould we do lightning real quick firstsure thing yeah yeah i think it's apt umsoquick high level on what the thelightning network is uh it is a scalingsolution for bitcoin that umallows you toum transact with uhactual real bitcoin um but you don't doso with what's known as an on-chainfootprint and so it allows you to sortof lock up a small amount of well asmuch bitcoin as you want onto thissecond layer solution known as thelightning networkso that you can umyou essentially just defer the theoverall settlement um of any number oftransactions from going on chain to toreduce fees and also to allow you totransact um much quickerso whereas uh one on chain transactionyou know might cost you a couple hundredsats depending on the fees and you youmight be able to send you know 10or even 100lightning network um transactions forthe sameuh for the same amount of fees um nowthere is uhunfortunately lots of caveats with thelightning network again in terms ofbeing able to do it properly uh with uhthe best way to do so be with one of theuh no packages that we've spoken aboutbefore andwhich will dictate that you need tomanage your own sort ofyour own channels which is essentiallywhere you lock up this bitcoin to beable to to transact on this second layerumso it's a little bit more of a hurdle toto get on board with um but you you sortof can save yourself a fair bit on feesespecially if we ever see a feast bikeagain um which i think is inevitable umthe i don't knowinevitable um sofirst of all there's been a lot ofdispatches on lightning if you gothrough the feedconsider listening to those there's likea lot of different caveats and nuanceswhen using lightningspecifically with privacy i did a fullprivacy episode with openobs and anthonythat's still dispatch 21 that's onlightning privacyuh so consider checking that out but themain differentiation that you as a newuser should think about with lightningis going back to our transaction feeconversation earlierwhich iswhen you use a regular bitcointransactionyour transaction fee is not based on theamount you send it could be kind ofweird for youuh it's it's actually based on theamount of utxos that you useuh for the transaction it's based on thedata size not the amount of money thatis sentsoyou could end up sending a five dollartransaction with bitcoin on chain aregular bitcoin transaction and it couldcost the same as sendinga five million dollar transactionnow with lightningit's different the way fees arecalculated on lightning is based on theamount you're sending so that'll be morecomparable to something that you're usedto in traditional finance world where ifyou send more money you're going to paya higher fee you send less money you'regoing to pay a lower feenowuh moon wallet with 2us as we talkedabout earlier mobile wallet supportslightningand blue wallet supports lightning nowif you use blue wallet in its defaultstate with lightning it's going to be acustodial walletwhich i don't loveuh if you insist on using it use it witha small amount because they can takeyour funds you are trusting them withyour privacy um ifuhyou can also use blue wallet withsomething called lnd hub which some ofthese node projects offeri think umbral and my node offered idon't know who else offers it but if youuse it with lnd hub or your friend's lndhub then it's not custodial with bluewallet it's custodial with who's everrunning the lnd hub so if you run thelnd hub yourselfthen it's not custodialotherother lightning specific wallets onmobilethat you can use so moon does bothblue wallet does boththen there's lightning specific mobilewallets that are very good uh there'sphoenixwallet uh there's breeze walletumbreeze b-r-e-e-zcontinuing the bitcoin naming scheme ofusing words and spelling themdifferently um is there anotherlightning wallet that i'm missinglightningeclair as well haven't youwell claire is phoenixphoenixyeah why do they have two okay but yeahboth of those are good yeah one allowsyou to manage your own channels and theother one does it for youokay phoenix does it for youyepokay so forget eclair your new corneryou have phoenix and you have breezewallet or you can use moon or bluewallet and that'srather than for savings you should thinkof that more asokay this is like my spending wallet mytransaction fees are based on the amounti send i'm going to be sending smalleramounts umso i i might use lightning rightyeah i agree i'm quite a big fan ofphoenix um especially from a perspectiveof you know one that a wallet thatmanages the channels for you and i mightget a lot of for this in the chatbut i'm i'm a firm believer that mostnew users don't shouldn't strive todive head first into lightning withtheir own channels because it's it'sit's not easy it's not approachable andeverything that we've already discussedum in terms of holding your own keys umuh using coinjoin and and not using kycare far more important than uh strivingto get your own channels up and runningum quickly uh i don't know what youthink about that matt and i'm waitingfor the in the chat no i mean ithink i i i think umlightning on mobile uh with the walletswe just mentioned moon blueum breeze phoenixfor smaller spending amountsuh is very accessibleuh actuallyif you if you actually want to dolightning in a proper sovereign wayum that i would say is a more advancedthing don't get intimidated by it but ii think it's important for ourall-encompassinggetting started guide that we do mentionit it exists and what are the you knowdifferent trade-offs basically thetrade-off there is a little bit you'regetting less security uh you're gettingless reliability with lightning umbut you're getting lower feesfaster transactions all else equalum[Music]and it could be very useful in a mobilespending type of situationyeah i agreephoenix and brees really great ways toto get started with lightning that havesort of their own unique um trade-offsuh that kind of give the the best ofboth worlds from it from a new userperspectivewhen you compare them with umcustodial solutions like the defaultblue wallet or running your own channelsand that's one of theyeah i mean that's one of the reasonswhy i like moon so much like moon with2us has like different tradeoffsum it doesn't have a standardized backupprocessuh it's you know if if you'rea lot of big corners will say it's youknow not a lightning wallet but at theend of the dayit's not a lightning wallet because youstore all your funds on chain you're notstoring it in a proper lightning walletum but what's cool about moon isif you scan a qr code it could be alightning qr code or it could be aregular bitcoin qr code and it justautomaticallyfigures that out for youum and and vice versa yeah so so you canjust have you can have some spendingcash in your moon wall at muunand whatever whatever bitcoin qr codeyou scan it will send but it doesn'thave power user features it doesn't havethat coin selection that we were talkingabout with utxo management it doesn'thave labelingit doesn't have a standard backupprocessso these are all things to keep in mindright multisig multisig let's let's gohere's where we get into the weeds alittle bit um right so you've been inthe weeds for a whileall of the uh wallets that we've spokenabout umthe desktop wallets mobile wallets alloperate umon what we colloquially call a singlesig setup where they have um a singlesecret or backup um which is requiredwhen you want to spend your bitcoin amulti-sig wallet is where you combinetwo or more of theseseparate wallets together to create abrand new walletwhen you set up this multisig wallet youcan dictatethe minimumamount of keys required to be able tomake ato sign or authorize a send transactionso that could betwo from a possible three keys is apopular one all the way up to somethingelaborate like 11 or 15 you know whichmight be uh used in sort of a businesssetting props um but two of three whereyou need two signers from a possiblethree that were created to that we useto create the wallet to sign off on anytransactions from that wallet so whywould you want to do that wellwith a single sig wallet and some of thethree theoretical attack vectors ifsomeone's to someone but somebody was tosteal your deviceand and umwhile you know if they snatch your phonewhile it's out of your hand and you'vegot your wallet unlocked um they cansteal your bitcoin if that was one ofthe keys in a multi-sig wallet where youneeded two to spend from then they can'tsteal anything from youumanother one of the attacks that multisigprotect from is known as a retirementattack where there might be a malicioushardware wallet vendor thatdoesn't publish their source code um andthey umhave some uhmalware baked into into the the into thedevice and that is actually uh has theability to stealyour bitcoin i will say again correct meif i'm wrong game out but that has neverhappened again it's a theoretical attackbut if you were to use um a multi-sigsetup where you've got differenthardware wallet manufacturers if one ofthose is is maliciousum they can't get access to your fundsbecause they don't have you know if it'sjust one key out of two that arerequired they don't have the uhthe minimum number of keys required tosteal anythingall the goodall the good wallets all the goodhardware wallets are open source sotheoretically open source meansthat the code is available for you toverifyum and you can read the code line byline nowif you're a new coiner you're probablyup to this point you're already reallyintimidated you're like matt i can'tread codei'm aware okaysoat the end of the dayit is very good that you're able totechnically verify the code but mostpeople will be updating their hardwarewallets and they will not be verifyingthe code so there is some trust that youare you're trusting that hardware walletmanufacturer to not ship uh maliciouscode to you and you're also trustingthemuh that that the actual device wasn'tcompromised when it was first sent toyou right so with multisig the idea isyou can have multiple but specificallyin a hardware wallet ida hardware wallet multisig the idea isyou can have multiple vendorsuh that aremultiple different hardware wallets thatcome together to form your walletandyou needa combination of them as bitcoin q a wassaying a common one is two of three youneed two of them to spend the fundsthis reduces trust in any specifichardware wallet manufactureryou also have the added benefituh that those backup words instead ofthose backup words being aumone and done situation if someone findsthose secret backup words we call themseed words if someone finds those wordsthey have access to your funds in amulti-sig setup you haveummultiple sets of backup words and theyhave to find the required threshold ofbackup wordsin order to spend your funds so ifyou're using a two of three you're gonnahave three sets of backup words you'regonna have three hardware walletsthose backup boards obviously can be onsteel as we said earlierum and you can have them in differentlocations so bitcoin gives you bitcoinwith multisig gives you this uniquesituationwhere you can have a geographicallydistributeduh security setup where you're holdingyour own coinbutthethe the keys to access it can be locatedin different places they can beduplicated you can keep copies of themin different places and for someone toactually compromise you and take yourfunds they're gonna need to have accessto a combination secretwe lost bitcoin q a about two minutesago or a minute and a half ago and i'mjust gonna keep talking until hereconnectssothat is the main benefit of multisig[Music]do not once again do not get intimidatedhereuhplenty of people store bitcoin in singlesig uh setups it is thenormal way of setting it upum this is something you might graduatetouh multisig ux multisigumi guess ux can be kind of a complicatedwordlike the way you interface with themultisig walletis a relativelynew thing in bitcoinumso it it has a little bit more of alearning curve it is a little bit morerough around the edgessoyou want to get really comfortable withit as i said earlier you want to bebacking up restoring spending receivinggetting comfortable with it separatelyof your single sig setupnow one cool aspect of multisigis that you canactually have a single sig walletuh so you can be using a hardware walletthat is single sig and then you cantake that single sig and you canactually also use it in a multi-sigenvironmentandit can be one signer of for instance thetwo of three in the multi-sig but alsoit could also be its separate walletum andi guess the main advantage thereumi guess there's two main advantagesthere first of all if someone findsyour single sigback up your your secret words uh itmight have some small amount of funds onit and they think that's all your fundsthey they can't tell that it's in amulti-sig setupumso they might just take that funds andthink they took all your bitcoin umthis thesecondary benefit isthat you know you can repurpose thesethese hardware wallets and use them formultiple wallets now one other caveathere is with multi-sig you do want toback up additional information besidesjust your seed wordsumbitcoin q a came in and then left againso i will continueumthe popular multi-sig softwaresparrowspectre supports it blue wallet supportsitthey will tell you what you need to backup and make sure you save all thatinformation now that informationthat additional information that's notyour seed words umthey will have terms like derivationpathum descriptorthe list of something called x pubs youdon't necessarily have to know what allof that means you just have to save itand you just have to realize thatwhileseed words area security risk if someone gets yourseed wordsthat information that separateinformation that you have to back upwith a multi-stick wallet is a privacyrisk so if someone finds that they cansee how much you're holding in themultisig but they can't necessarilyspend itbut you need that information plus yourbackup boards in order touh to spend your funds bitcoin q are youbacki am apologies for that that'll happen ithink it's my networkno worries at all um i just continued onand i just kept talking about multisigdo you be holding it downumii get i mean i think we arei i think i sufficiently explainedmultisig tradeoffs and and benefitsumshould we move on to mistakes commonmistakesyeah did you cover sort of thealternatives to doing it yourself themultitec approach no i didn't that'sgreat why don't you go into thatyeah so obviously matt's just outlinedsome of the potential pitfalls withdoing it yourself umso one of the other options is known askind of collaborative custodyalternatives where um there will be acentralized service uhsome examples are on chain capital anduh casaumwhere they will help you coordinate amultisit quorum and where they hold oneof the keysand so that in the event that you wereto umso i'll give you an example you'd have akey on your mobile phoneyou'd have a key on a hardware walletand one of theseservices will hold the key as wellso they only have one key so they can'tsteal from you which is greatumbut if you were to lose say your phonewhat their key or the key on yourhardware while and he didn't have itbacked up they will be able to step inas a third party to help you move yourbitcoin so that in a doomsday scenarioand you um you don't lose your lifesavings which is really greatyou will pay for this service and againi'm not sure on how much each charge thebottom tier i think is just over 100umlast time i checked per year and one ofthe the trade-offs with this is that umunless you sign up uh without yourpersonal information which i believe isquite difficult to do umthethese uh centralized um entities thathold the key and part of yourmulti-sitcorum they know who you arethey know how much bitcoin you hold inthat wallet because they hold one of thekeys and they alsohold the sort of uhthe wallet file if you like to put itsimply and so that they canjust as a kyc exchange can umbe able to tie you to your bitcoinidentity so it's worth paying up thetrade-offs yeah and you're using theirnode sothe assumption is if you do this if youuse one of these providersuh you're trusting them with yourprivacy but they will hold your hand andthey will have a spare key for you aswellum and they will help you onboard intothe process they will help you gethardware wallets they will go throughthat whole process but you are trustingthem with your privacy they know yourtransactions they know your balancesandin 99 of situations they know who youare as well uh they'll know the ipaddress of your of your devices that youconnect fromthis is all kind of getting a little bittoo much into the weeds but the key isthat you're trusting them with yourprivacyum i was explaining earlier justbasically doing it yourself so you coulduse your own note and you aren'ttrusting someone in that situation youcan still haveumother people hold keys for you so abitcoin q a started with a two of threesetup because that's a very common setupbut another common setup is a three offive setup and if you do a three of fivesetup you have five total keys and youneed three to spendsoif you need three to spendyou can hold three keys yourself so thatyou know you have and you put them indifferent locations and you know youhave enough to spend it yourself butthen you can also have you know a familymember a frienda lawyerholdhold a key you can have differentcombinations of people hold the key soit can be very useful inum[Music]specifically in in situations whereyou're trying like inheritancesituations where if if you pass away youhave large bitcoin savings uh you knowmaybe a lawyer is holding one in a trustmaybe a couple family members areholding individual ones and theybasically all need to collaboratetogether in order to spend your funds ifyou have three keys with other peopleum but you can also do it in a way whereyou don'tyou don't they never have the thresholdthey need to compromise you pluscombined togetheryeah i think umjust one final thing before we move onto the next topic um inheritance is abig one for me that um i i sort of liketo drive over people who seem to seemkeen to kind of jump into the diyapproaches thatyou know you might have spent some timelistening to some podcasts watching someuh tutorials or reading some guides andfeel comfortable in setting up amultisigumsetup um but what happens if you're notaround tomorrow unexpectedly uh is yourspouse your next kin are they going tobe able to coordinate a spend from a twoor three or a three or five do they knowwhere to find the keys do they know howto recover it and if you answer no toany of those questions then uh all ofyour life savings disappears when youdisappear soand something to bear in mind especiallyif you're going to take the diy approach100 i'd also add that there's a middleground hereuh specifically supported by cold cardcalled seed xor and basically in thatsituation instead of having one seedit's not multisig but instead of havingone seed you have two seeds and you needboth of them in order to spend yourfundsso it's a little bit different thanmulti-sig it can be more accessible topeople uh because you don't have theseadditionalcomplications that we were justdiscussing with multi-sigbut it gives you that benefit of nothaving a single seedbackup wordsthat can be compromised by someonethere's also something that's supportedby pretty much every wallet out therecalled a passphraseand in that situation you have thesebackup boards are usually 12 wordphrases or 24 word phrases thepassphrase is the 13th word or the 25thword and you pick that yourselfso if you do that method then you cankeep the passphrase separate from yourbackup words if someone wants tocompromise you they need access to bothumand i mean if it's a weak passphrasethey might just take your backup boardsand keep trying pass raisesumbut it it adds an additional umburden on them to try and compromise youwithout going through a multi-sig setupum anotherinteresting thing about passphrases isyou can store money on the bear backupwords and then you cannot when you use apasswords it's a separate wallet soin that situation you can actually keepfunds on youryour basic backup boardsand then if someone finds that they'lljust steal those that money and theymight not know you have a passphrasewith the majority of your savings in itum so that's just something to keep inmindawesome do you want to cover off uh somesome common mistakesnext on the listyeah i think common mistakes is a goodspot to go nextuh so i've got quite a lengthy list hereandthe first one of which unfortunately iuhfell fell prey to a little bit um andthat is uh it comes back to our veryfirst pointof cape kycmultiple exchanges and without any realneed to really um so i've just uh sortof expose myself to you know put my nameon loads of different databasesand soit's an unfortunate one that you can'treally undo like we spoke about beforeand if you were to you know listen tothis podcast and decide that youumstill want to gofor a kyc exchange because you think youknow the task of going uh no care adviceandtry and limit your umyour exposure to this by just signing upwith one reputable exchange umi think that's a good one to start anddid youi think that's very good advice like ifyou are going to use a kyc service whereyou're providing your identityinformation you should choose itcarefully you should choose someone youtrust the mostand you shouldnot sign up for a lot of people justsign up for a ton of different servicesyou should only you should sign up forthe bare minimum ideally if you're gonnado it you sign up for oneyou use it solely just to buy bitcoinand then send it to your own walletsumand and you don't you don't use anyother additional kyc services you wantto limit that as much as possiblesecond thing is did you change your micsetup at all because it's way worse nowthan it was beforeuhhello i changed my computer um i'll havea player how much while you're talkingnow turn up is it just quietno we can hear you but it's just likebreaking up a little bit it's likecutting in and outall right i'll let i'll play aroundumanother common mistakeuhthat i see people make isi i mean gambling on coins so a lotof people will think that um bitcoin istoo expensive and i've missed the boatand i i'm too late to bitcoin umliterally every single person who hasentered bitcoin at any time in bitcoinhistory has thought they were too latethere's like a famous screenshot ofsomeone on one of the bitcoin forums uhlamenting that they didn't get in atfive cents and instead they got in at adollar and they were too late and theymissed the busum so everyone feels that wayuh you're not alone in that it'simportant to realize that you cantransact insmaller units of account we call themsatssoyou can you don't have to have a fullbitcoin you don't you don't you don'tneed like right now bitcoins at almost70 thousand dollars you don't need toput 70 000 and to use bitcoin uh satsare the smallest unit of bitcoin there'sa hundred million of themper bitcoin andright now sats you can get 1500 for adollar so you can send any amount ofsats you want to send you can send twodollars worth you can send 25 centsworthumit doesn't matter don't get caught up inin in thinking that bitcoin is tooexpensiveuhwhat common thing that these other coinswill dois they make it so they have so manyunitsthat it seems like it's cheaper than itis just to try and get you in the doorit's a it's a marketing tactic so justkeep that in mind uh q are you thereyeah how's my mic now oh so much betteri'm glad i brought it up perfect okay doyou have more common mistakesuh yeah common one um is just notpracticing umenough with transacting uh testing mybackups for my hardware walletstesting different wallets even usingtest net just practice practice practiceand getting comfortable uh using the thevarious tools that we've spoken aboutandgetting comfortable with it either usingtestnet which is basically uha copy a carbon copy of bitcoin that'shas that holds no value you can get itfor free onwebsites called faucets where you can goon and just mimic the normal behavior ofa walletand without the fear oflosing any real value and so you cansend some test net bitcoin to to your hardware wallet and youcan wipe it recover itand just to get really reallycomfortable with with that process sothatif um the worst was happening and yousomething was to happen to your houseuh where you say bitcoin wherever youstore your coin andyou're when you're in that packed stateit's not like the first time you touchyour hardware wallet for five yearsbecause you you know you've done thatyou know people call practice so you'vegot this lots of time if you send realvalue in there but it'sconnected to you and because you know ifyou're in a panic and you you need tomove your bitcoin quickly the last thingyou might be doing is doing itin unfamiliar uhsituation or in a familiarsituation wherebecause that's when mistakes happen andyou could uh muck something upyeah so we see that happen a lot whereyou know peopleuh so i actually don'tespecially for newcomers i don't know ifyou need to use testnetum it adds just anothercomplication to your processumbut but what happens a lot is likepeople will buy bitcoin they'll send itto a hardware wallet they never reallyuh get comfortable with itthen bitcoin goes up in valuesignificantly and like four years laterthey're trying to spend it and they'rejust not comfortable at allso you really want to get comfortablewith it you want to practice sendingreceiving backing up and restoring umand just you know i don't think testthat's necessary in that situationbecause you should just do it with thesmall amounts you knowuse you know send five dollars back andforthuh erase the wallet restore it from yourbackup see that your five dollars arestill thereum one nice thing about my earlierapproach that i mentioned if having twoof the same hardware walletis without putting funds at risk at allyou can load up one hardware wallet withsome bitcoinand then you can restore iton your second hardware wallet you canload up those secret words onto thathardware wallet and if your funds arethere and you can spend them then youknow you did the backup and restoreprocess correctly without actuallywiping the original wallet so that'sanotherbenefit you're basically verifying yourbackup and restore processyou don't want to be in a situationwhere you have a lot of moneyandyou have a lot of money on the line andyou've never done a backup you've neverhave you've never done a restoredprocess and you're just freaking out andmaybe you wrote down the words wrongi've had that happen to friends wherewe've had to guess the word that theythey wrote down wrong or wrote down inbad handwriting um so you don't youdon't want to be in that situation youwant to practice practice practicei think just to add to that uh backupprocess as well is thatmost of the umor the hardware wallets that we'vetalked about this evening havemultiple different types of backups aswell so i think it's worth noting thatpractice using both of them as well sowe've got the the siege words umboth call card and passport alsoofferingbackups as well where you can store itbackup onto a micro sd card um which is alittle bit easier to store and so iwould urge people to practice restoringfrom both methods as well becauseat the end of the day if again if in adoomsday scenario you don't know whichmethod of backup you're actually goingto have access to or which is survivedwhatever um you know doomsday scenariohas actually happened100um before we move on to more commonmistakes we have alex mccluskey in thechat asking about 401k ira fundsum if you're trying to hold bitcoin in aa in a in a tax beneficial way in yourretirement accounti would just keep this very simple uh ifyou do haveuh a 401k or an ira where you alreadyhave funds in it and you want to movethem into bitcoinjust consider using uh the serviceoffered by unchained capital that'sunchained.com disclosure they are asponsor of ofmy other show rabbit will recap thisshow does not have sponsorsumbut they're a sponsor becausethey're a good team it's a good productumi have friends there that are workingthere my buddy jeff andrew runs theirtheir retirement division and they willhold your handthey will help you through it obviouslyas we said earlier the caveat is you'retrusting them with your privacyum but pretty much in all situationswith retirement funds if you're using atax beneficial retirement uh methodyou're going to have to trust someonebecause it's all getting reported to thegovernment as wellthe nice thing about what unchained doesis you hold your own keys so you getthat tax benefit um but you're holdingyour own keys they can't spend yourfundsa lot of the other programs that are outthereumcan can spend your funds at will and youhave to trust them completely with thesecurity of your funds and your privacyso just something to keep in mindyeah the next one umfrom me is kind of a little bit moreoutside of the box umi lurked around on on bitcoin twitterand in some of the communities uh for alot longer than i really should have umwhen i started to uh interact with withpeople in the you knowwallet chat rooms or the no chat roomsand to use a few examplesmy knowledge grew exponentially fromthen onwards from having thoseinteractions versus me just sitting onthe sidelines and kind of you knowliking a few tweets every now and thenso if i was to go back and kind of havemy time again i i'd absolutely startgetting involved and start contributingand to the conversation much muchearlier because uh personally speakinganywaymy my knowledge just uh you knowskyrocketed compared to where i was justa couple of years ago and so big one forme that oneyeah that's uhand uh i just i think like learn bydoing right practice with small amountsumand get your feet wet rather than feelintimidated and feel like you have toread everything and listen to everythingand watch everything uhbefore you even get your feet wetyeah another one as well is and and mattmight roll his eyes at this one is iskind of going publicumthere there's a lot of value in instaying in the proverbial shadow so tospeak um i would urge people you knownot touh sort of start shouting from therooftops uh that they own bitcoin againbecause you know we talked earlier aboutkyc and how we kind ofcan paint a sort of red cross on yourback a little bit well shout from therooftops um when bitcoin hits anall-time high to all your friendsand might uh inadvertently do the samething one day um you know yeah 100 alittle bit jealous you never know he'sgoing to get jealous andtell somebody else you tell somebodyelse who'san individual that might want to try andget their hands on it soum i would be be candid about who youwho you speak to bitcoin about and it'sa bita double-edged sword that one because uhi think we've all got a little bit of apersonal responsibility to try and helpon on board others as well so um alsosay just kind of be selective about whoyou speak to it and what you sayyeah it is um it might sound a littlehypocritical coming for meum as aas as a as a public bitcoin figureumbutdefinitely in the beginning you shouldnotyou should you should not be talking youshould try and reduce how much you talkabout bitcoin don't make it obvious thatyou own bitcoin don't post on socialmediauh consider using a name like bitcoin qa does i mean it might surprise you buthe wasn't born with that namehe decided on that name himself for theinternet for his bitcoin workumin the future if you do want to becomemore public about ituhyou can do so in a moreresponsible wayum rather than doing it right in thebeginning you can never come back fromit once you do itum so it's something to keep in mindyou should never talk about your ownbitcoin you should never talk about yourown how much bitcoin you haveumthese are best practices uh you don'tyou don't uheven if it's a friend or a family memberit might seem like small amount todaybut in the futureuh it could be a large amount and theywill not forget it they tend to rememberone of the first questions mostfriends and family will ask you is howmuch bitcoin you own they love askingthat questiondo not answer it explain why you don'twant to answer it for themumif people do know you own bitcointhis is where that multi-sig setupreally shines because you can have itgeographically distributed you can haveyour keys in different locations um thatare far away from each other that makeyou getting compromised more difficulteven in a physical attack situation andobviously it is more ideal to live in aplace where you haveum proper gun rights and you can defendyourselfumso these are things to considerum if i was to do it againi probably would not be uh you know aspublic as i am about bitcoin um i made ajudgment calllater on in my bitcoin journey that ifelt we needed more public bitcoinfigures that were talking about realissues and specifically privacy um so imade that judgment call but there aresome mornings that i wake up and regretitumbut there are precautions you can takeand there are benefits though to beingsemi-public about your bitcoin usage uhmeeting people i've met some of the bestpeopleyou know i have i have basically i havefamily now that wouldn't exist otherwiseum but these are all things that youshould considerum as part of your bitcoin journey butin the beginningvery very very stronglywould sayyou know keep keep it as discreet aspossibleum you never knowyou knowyou you don't want to expose yourself toa malicious actor your government couldturn on bitcoina foreign government can use thatinformation against you uh if you'retraveling across a border or somethinglike thatso you you want to keep this in mindyeah the final um sign off one for me umwould beuhi just completely got out of my brainuh what is another two fa is another onea good one to touch on i think um yeswould be um if if you and it's just comeback into me now so i've got two tofinish off um if you again listen tothis podcast decide that no kosc is notfor you and you want to sign up for anexchange and a lot of these exchangeswill prompt you to use uh sms-basedtwo-factor authentication to um i'musing air quotes here to secure youraccountum this is where you'll get a textmessage to when you try and log into theto the exchange they'll send you a textmessage to authorize that login um therehave been multiple umuhinstances where this has beenexploited people have had theirinformation and their accounts hacked onthese exchangeswhich if youunfortunately have got funds on thataccountcan be withdrawn to whoever's got accessto your account they can withdraw it totheir own walletanda better alternative and would be to usean app-based uhtwo-factor authentication so an examplewould be umthere's one called anduh there's one called a edgiest uhthere's another one called um help meout here matt i've drawn a blank umuh did you say agesyeah i said aegis yep aegis is myfavoriteany app-based one and far more secureand there's been far f well aegis isopen source aegis is open source uhthat's a e g i s and the backup processis very easy you got to remember whenyou when you use these authenticatorapps umif your phone dies you want to make sureyou have a backup of themso yeah the most popular one is googleauthenticator and it's notlast i mean i haven't used it inmaybe six years or something like thatbut previously it wasn't easy to back upso make sure you're using one that iseasy to back upand back it up and keep multiple copiesyeah or the other alternative is you canget umlike a physical device that acts as yourthe second factor authentication lookslike a bit of a usb key that providesthe the additional authorizationbut less services tend to umoffer compatibility with those100umi i would say i think for most peoplethe physical device is overkillum can a sophisticated attackercompromise a phone base two factoruh yesum have we seen any widespread cases ofthat no do they still need your emailand your password yes umon that note you shouldn't be using thesame emails and the same passwords indifferent placesum if you go to haveibinpone.com you canput your email address in and it'll tellyou wheneveruh database gets leaked with your emailor your password or your personalinformation um so that's a veryimportant resource but but what we see alot of times is like there'll be like aleaklike maybe facebook will get hacked andthose emails and passwords will then beused at all the other services to tryand get into your accountum so that two-factor code gives you anadditional protection on top of that butyou really shouldbe trying to limit reuse of emailaddresses and never reuse passwords umyeahuh yeah there's one in the chat scoobysnacks asking is a password manager agood idea yes definitely would recommendit to anybody my personal favorite isis bit warden again another free andopen source uh software they do offer apaid version as well but the thefreemium uhoption is perf is perfectly good enoughfor for uh 99 of users i would sayyeah bit warden's great um you justgottaif you're using a password managerum there's some nuance there because ifyou're not self-hosting your passwordmanager you're using awhat's the main onelastpass people love lastpassumit's closed source you're kind ofputting all your eggs in one basketuhso there's some concern there you knowif you if you have all your passwords inthis password manager and that passwordmanager gets compromised then all ofyour accounts are compromisedumwhat i think is like a veryuh easy accessible thing forumnew users or people that are concernedis is your really important passwordsyou can just write them in a notebookyou write them in a notebooksomeone's going to need to get access tothat notebook physically in order tocompromise youumyou might not want to write it outcompletely clear you know maybe somethings you remember versus some thingsare on the paperyou can develop your own like kind ofcode system don't over complicate ityou'll probably forget the passwordum[Music]but uhpaper and pen paper and pen is a triedand true methodyeah absolutely and then just don't putit on athe final one that went out my headbefore um waswe've spoken about uh you know there's alot of information the past couple ofhours umdon't try and uh do everything in thespace of a week especially if you areliterally at step one um i would sort ofpick one of these topics you know wespoke about them in aumin a specific order for a reason and iwould urge people to sort of start fromstep one and try and master each stepbefore they move to the net before theymove on or at least not try to do toomany of them at the same timedepending on the approach depending onthe the approach that you take for thedifferent tools that we've we've spokenuh you know to do it properly and to doit justice and to understand it andpractice it like we've been like we'vebeen sort ofreiterating it's gonna take you you knowum a good bit of time you're gonna haveto dedicate some time to do this and tomaster some of these tools so trying todo too much too soon is setting yourselfup to to fail so take your time uh beum deliberate about it and and sort ofmaster something then move onyeah and our i that's great advice andas bitcoin q a said our order in thisepisode was intentionalso don't feel like you have to gothrough all the steps at once butgo throughthat order was how we we we chose thatorder specifically because we think it'sa very um[Music]efficient effectiveuh managing trade-offs and stuff balanceof what order you should kind of becoming into this um we also have someperson in the chatum who uses the nim some person so everytime i call him out in the chat i soundlike i'm just don't care about his nameuh asking for the best a two-factor appfor ios i really like authenticator plusfor ios users um i think it's availableon android as well but if you're onandroid i really just like aegisumso yeah there you go for that answerum i have on this list bitcoin q a ihave common questions do you have commonquestions that you have in mind orum i've got nothing noted down but kindof umoff the top of my headum a common one that i get is sort of uhis umis this setup good for me or is thiswallet the one i should useuhyou know insert service or or tool hereyou know is this goodum it's the thing with bitcoin and andusing the tools properly that we've beenspeaking about is thatwhat matter i might recommend from ourown personal experiencesmight not be perfectly applicable toyour own personal uh throat metal threatmodels or skill set um soagain we we have kind of covered thisground a little bit earlier but is umjust try things out um you know by i'mnot saying don't come to the people imatter myself and ask for advice youknow we're always um more than happy toto to help out um but the best thing todo is to sort ofget your hands dirty and try these toolsyou know you can do it for for free orfor a very low fees at the moment andjust testing out wallets or or differentdevicesor multi-sig setups if you want to gothat far coinjoin implementationsumbest thing to do is get your hands dirtyget get amongst the communities and youknow what's perfect for one person mightnot be perfect for another so umit's a bit of adyor do your own research and getcomfortable with what's going to workfor you really100 um just to reiterate umbitcoin q a has all of his guides atbitcoiner.guideumi have a list of resources and tools atcivildispatch.comhelpat the top of civildispatch.com help ihave also i have links toboth bitcoin q aummyselfand our buddy katan from australia whoruns ministry of nodes offers uhwe offer private one-on-ones and there'slinks to all of that at the top ofcivildispatch.comhelpum so if you dofeel that you you have the need for aone-on-one a specific time to jump on acallum that is available to you as well ihighly recommend both bitcoin q aand and katan uh for that and that's whythey are at the top of that pageumi thinkuh narwhal tacos has an interestingpoint i i kind of touched on it but ifelt like it was a little bit too earlyin the episode so i didn't go heavy intoitumhe's asking have you explained that noone actually holds their sats in a wallat just the key it took me a while towrap my head around thatthat is absolutely correctum you're not actually storing yourbitcoin you're storing the key thatallows you to access and spend yourbitcoin um so when we talk about allthese wallets when we talk abouthardware wallets and mobile wallets it'sreally uh either piece of software apiece of hardware that is that isstoring that secret key for you andallowing you to easily access that soyou can access your bitcoin um i thinkthat's an important point but i i do iwould say thatthat's almost more of ai don't know i i feel like it's more ofan advanced thingfor all intents and purposes you cankind of operate under the assumptionthat you're holding your bitcoin in thewallet butum it is a good it is a good point thankyou narwhal tacos um i think with allthat said it doesn't seem like we haveuh any any additional questions in thelive chat i would add that obviouslythis is still dispatch 43 there's been42 other episodes filled with contentum well that's a lot more advanced thanthis so if you want to dive into thatafter listening to this obviously feelfree to do that it's all available forfree without ads or sponsorsum q a you have any any additionalthoughts here before we wrap upi just want to reiterate just getamongst the communities use the toolsget your hands dirty don't be afraid totry things out um come to myself or mattfor any help and advice and just oneother you know we've mentioned katan umone of the prominent educator in thespaces uh btc sessions got a fantasticyoutube page that's got guy video guideson using literally everything to do withbitcoin so um if you're more of a visuallearner uh check out his youtube channelit's a fantastic resource as well 100that is also linked at civildispatch.comhelp or you can just search btc sessionson youtubeum i made him a channel on bitcointv.comi don't think he has uploaded anythingtherebut there's also a ton of great contentat bitcointv.com that is curated one ofthe issues and the pitfalls you shouldkeep in mind when you're on youtubeumespecially the high view count videosare filled withscams and bad advice um so you need tobe very careful uh you know if you'rewatching a btc sessions video it mightrecommend another video that looks likeit's reputable and that a lot of peoplehave watched and recommended ityou need to be very carefuluhat the end of the day bitcoin's aboutpersonal responsibilityumso no one's gonna be there if you loseyour bitcoin there's no getting it backuh and there'sthere's a lot of money to be made givingbad advice and showing bad productso you really really need to beskeptical all the timethink for yourself make your owndecisions and constantly keep learningand i want to be very clear herethat i'm not asking you to trust meeitheror bitcoin q a or catan or anything elsewe've mentioned in this video in thisvideo or any of the other civil dispatchepisodesyou need to constantlyfigure out things for yourself and makeyour own judgment calls if anyone'sasking you to trust thembe very very careful and just be verycareful in generalumbtc pins wants everyone all thenewcomers to know that they could buythey could buy merch from him atbtcpins.com so there you go btc pins

bitcoin onapple pay here's what he saidit's something that we're looking atit's not something we have uhimmediate plans to douhfori would sort of characterize it as thereare things that i wouldn't dolike umuh our our cash balancei wouldn't go invest that in crypto uhnot because i wouldn't invest my ownmoney in crypto but because i don'tthink people buy an apple stockto get exposure to cryptoand so if they want to do that they canthey can uhuhyou know invest directly in crypto orthrough other meansuh and so i wouldn't do thatand i'm i'm not planning to in theimmediate future to take crypto for ourproductsas a as a mean of tender uh but thereare other things that we're definitelylooking at like whatuh like i wouldn't want tohave anything to announce todaywell let me ask you a different questionbecause you just said that you might notdo it personallydo you own crypto in any bitcoin orethereum would you play around with thisi i do yeah i think it's reasonable toown it as a as a part of a diversifiedportfolio and i'm not giving anybodyinvestment advice by the wayso[Music]happy bitcoin tuesday freaks it's yourboy matt o'dell here for anothercitadel dispatch the interactive liveshow

it's all encompassing from startto finish new new bitcoin are cominginto the space trying to do things youknow the right way trying to do thingsin a secure wayumand and just have it all in a singleepisode have it all in a singleconversationso as i was saying earlier the writerdies that are in the live chat um if youhave questions put your questions in ifif you're not a beginner and you'relistening in and you think we missedsomethinguh feel free to put that in the livechat as well and just a reminder thelive chat is accessible through thetwitter twitch and youtube streams andthey all getfed into uh the main chat so with allthat said i'd like to introduce bitcoinq a how's it going bitcoin q ahey matt it's going good thank you forhaving me back on uh it's been a while ithink um episode number two was now withthat with ergo so uh yeah lookingforward to getting back to it and uhrunning through some some of thebeginner-focused uh stuff that seems tobe missing from some of the podcasts uhfloating around me to tend to get jumpinto the weeds pretty quickly sometimesdon't we yeah i mean i have a feeling weare going to also be jumping into theweeds but we're going to try and do itin a nice constructive path into theweedsyeah i need you to keep me uh keep me incheck on that onebut yeah you are a dispatch lg it hasbeen it's been a minute and uh we'vewe've both been through a loti like to see like to think that we'vebeen through it together and uh yeahjust uhlove that you're back joining us and youknow i hope it's you know not just thesecond time it'll be many more times inthe futureumso with all that said freaks uh we havea bit of a structure that we set up forthis episode which is unusual fordispatch but i think it'll keep usmore focused um and so we're going tostart withactuallygetting bitcoin for the first timeum so do you want to you want to startwith that bitcoin q ayeah so uh it's buying bitcoinsnever been easier than it is todaythere's uh exchanges popping up all overthe place every every man in this dogseems to beuh giving you the opportunity to to beable to buy bitcoin from within theirecosystem or their appumthe the kind of elephant in the roomunfortunately and uh is is the um knowyour customer or kyc is it's uh it'slovingly called within the spaceumkyc is a regulation that essentially anysort of businessentity that has a banking relationshiphas to abide by that kind of dictates umthat they must collect certain pieces ofinformation from anybody that they givea service to obviouslyin the context of bitcoin that's anexchange that sells you bitcoin fordollars pounds yen whatever yourjurisdiction isumso in practice that looks like if youlike go on the cash app and you try andsign up to cash app to buy bitcointhey require you to upload your id youraddressuh i'm not sure some some servicesrequire like a selfie um that's whatwe're talking about right here which isthis identification information that'srequired when you sign up to one ofthese regulated servicesright and some of these are some ofthese exchanges now are even doing uhvideos where you they take that like a3d scan of your face which is kind ofscary really andso with all that said why why is thatkind of um why is that sort of a badthing that that people like matt andmyself sort of try andumwarm people away from or at least paintthe dangers clearly for everybodyeverybody um so when you supply thisinformation to to be able to buy bitcoinin a you know a really sort of easy andstress free way you know cash apps agood example where you can just in acouple of clicks get some bitcoin into awallet that you controlbut one of the main problems is that youknow all of this information getsrounded up into a centralized databasethat's controlled bythe entity that you're doing businesswithum unfortunately these entities or someof these entities they won't toureverybody with the same brush um don'thave a great track record of uh securingit effectively umtalk about perfect timing we we heardabout um a hack with uh robin hoodyesterday was it it was seven millionusersseven million users uminformation has been leaked um nowthere's varying degrees of the severityof the leak some of it's just emailaddresses uh some of it's more personalinformation like banking details etcumyou know to name a few others equifaxfacebook t-mobile clubhouse linkedinuh coinbase ledger um all of thosecompanies umrequiresome form ofof your personal information to to dobusiness with them and and they've allhad hacks where again with varyingdegrees of severity that um somebodythat shouldn't have got their hands onyour information did so i'm you knowwhat we're not talking small fry heresome of these uh hacks were in to thetune of millions and millions of ofpeopleum now you know if that's something likefacebook and your uh email address getsleaked you know it's not really the endof the world it might piss you off alittle bitwhen you tie that into umsomething like bitcoin wherehopefully especially after you'velistened to this podcast and you're sortof securing your own wealth that mightbe uh in your house that might be in aloved one's house or a combination ofthoseif uh if if the wrong person was to gethold of this information you know yourselfie your home addressum indicate in the case of coinbase howmuch bitcoin you've actually boughtthat is umessentially painting a very large crosson your front door that ummight make it inviting to the wrong typeof people to come and pay you a visit tosee if they can relieve you of of thosesatsso that's one of the main umyou knowuh reasons that that i personally tryand sort of make people aware that yesgoing on to cash app or coinbase orwhatever is is you know they make itreally really simple they've got reallynice polished uis to to be able to goand umget some get your hands on some statswithin it within a couple of clicks umit'syou know one of the big big risks isthat this information is leaked on aregular basis and there are companies inspace that to their credit and haveyou know they've nev never umbeen fallen prey to one of these attacksand but unfortunately they do seem to becoming um more and more uh frequent umso yeahthat's one of the main risks with kyc soyeah i mean i would add a couple thingshere uh first of all even if you know acompany hasn't been compromised yet weshould basically operate under theassumption that they will be compromisedin the futureumthis information once it is taken isoften soldto other people as wellit can be combined with otherinformation that was leaked from otherdatabases so for instanceumif you know you you have the facebookleak and the facebook leak has yourmailing address in it and then you havethe ledger leak and your ledger leak hasyour email address in it but thefacebook link also had your emailaddress in it they can combine those twouh leaks to get your full email addressand your actual in-person addresssecond of all we've seen umwe've seen physical attacks happen topeople who were known bitcoiners and howmuch bitcoin they had uh sometimes itwas because of these leaks it's hard totell for sure sometimes it's becausepeople just talk about their bitcoin andhow much bitcoin they own which you alsoshouldn't doumthird of alluhthis information can obviously be usedagainst you by your own government itcan also be used against you by foreigngovernments in the future obviously itis painting a target as you are someonewho owns bitcoin and uses bitcoin andexactly how much bitcoin you haveuh and then fourth of all in thecoinbase league specificallyumall of your withdrawal history was alsoleaked so uh it can be used to trackyour future bitcoin transactions uhbased on that information and we will gofurther in onon bitcoin privacy and trade-offs ofbitcoin when using bitcoin trying to useit privately how to go about that inlater on in this episode but these arejust things to keep in mindright so you know all of which is issort of incredibly scary um and theother thing final thing odds aboutbefore we sort of look onto thealternatives is that you know umsomething that i like to sort of keep inmind and remind people is you knowbeing here for number go up is great youknow i'm not going to sit here and saythat um i don't like to see us hitall-time highs all the time um butbitcoin is also umcreated to be able to make thetransactions that they don't want you tomakenowif you're sort of uh tying all of yourbitcoin to your personal identity umyou're you're kind of putting a inyour armor before you've even startedthat you know if you do want to makethose purchases that umbitcoin allows you to make um due to itspseudonymity thenyou're sort of starting two steps backby tying your your bitcoin holdings toyour personal identity um which is wheresort of buying from a new kyc source itcomes in so that you can have umsome or hopefully you know in a perfectsituation all of the bitcoin that youownso before we get there before we getthere just one more thingkycthese records are forever once once youdo these records you have to assumethey're foreverum is it best practice to delete anaccountum i you know if you're no longer usingit yes but you should assume that actualdatabase record hasn't been deleted umand it might be used against you in thefuture um so these are things to keep inmind umnow let's move to okay so if you'retrying to avoid kyc you don't want touse one of these regulated services whatare your optionsright so the the sort of uh two mostcommon ones that kind of get bannedaround in terms of actually purchasingbitcoin um is bisque uh which is apeer-to-peer uh decentralized exchangewhere you essentially it's a maker takermodel where somebody will want to umsell some bitcoin and they will go on tobisque and they'll say you know i wantto sell uh x amount of bitcoin for thismuch um you know 500 whatever and andthen you as a buyer can go on to thatsort of uh peer-to-peer marketplace andand look for these offers to see onethat sort of fits your bill that youknow was is within your price range andyou know the amount that you want to buyyou can go on completely and honestanonymously and and sort of take theirtheir sell offer so that you can buythat amount of bitcoin from themumthis isbisqyep so it's an application that you justdownload onto your computer basicallyyou run it all locally uh you knowthere's no personal information youdon't need to show any id's to sign upthe only person again depending on thepayment method that you use you knowthere's many many payment methods umsome are better from a privacyperspective than others and but let'ssay you knowmost people are going to go on and andif they want to sort of be able to takea wider range of offers from you knowmore people across the world they'regoing to want to use the banking systemwhich you know might ring some alarmbells to some other people listening butumwhat also i say is what's worse issharing your banking information withone person who is very likely to wantvery likely to be a privacy preservingindividual because they you know theyprobably wouldn't be using bisqueotherwise versus uh the regulatedentities that throw all of yourinformation into a centralized honey potthat we've just explainedum so that's one way you know some ofthe more private options that areavailable on bisc umare sort of postal money orders whichyou know i don't really know great dealabout um because it's a u.s centricthing um but you've also got cash in themailand then there's various various otheroptions that are kind of uh relevant totheir sort of jurisdictionsumanother option as well is huddle huddlewhich worksquite similarly to the way i've justdescribed with bisc and the thedifference being is a huddle huddle iskind of a centralized company um thathosts uh the sort of buy and sell uhlocations for you you know it's awebsite huddlehuddle.comum where you can go and sort of makeoffers or you can take offers again inthe same fashion umso so there may be some uh other alarmbells are in game where thinking whereum well what happens if i go on tobiscor to huddle hollow um and i youknow take this buy offer and i sendsomebody some some you know us dollarsand what's to stop them from just neversending me the bitcoin so both of theseservices um work on what's called anescrow system where the seller will haveto deposit the bitcoin first into amulti-sig wallet that is controlled byum by the buyer the seller and the sortof centralized entity um so thatbasically they theyuh can't sort of run off uh once they'veyou know got hold of your dollarsbecause they have to deposit the bitcoinfirst and and you'll be notified to waituntil you send any of the payments sothat they've proved that they've sort ofdepositedthe bitcoin into that um there is stillsome risk there but it's a reduced riskyeah absolutely you knowit's kind of i would say it's more of agrief and attack than ayou're not really at risk of losingfunds it's more of a um going throughthe arbitration process to prove thatyou've sent the dollars so that you getthe bitcoin back in the end so it'sgonna be more of a headache more than arisk to to actually lose any uhany cash would you sayyeah more or less umsoyeahcontinue so some of the other options umif youuh you can buy from bitcoin atmsthere's a really great website calledcoinatm radar.comwhere you can go on and punch punchingyour physical location i would recommenddoing sousing a vpnand and it will tell you all of thebitcoin etms thatare in your local area the the generalpremise of these is that you uh walk upyou can deposit some cashuh give it a um bitcoin address uhhopefully from a wallet that you controlwhich we're going to come on to laterand the bitcoin will be depositeddirectly into that wallet that youcontroluh there are again as is always the casewith bitcoins from caveats um justbecause you're depositing cash doesn'timmediately make bitcoin atm superprivate depending on the umthe brand of atm machine that you usesome of them do still ask for id um butthat is uh distinguished on the websitei've just said which is callingatmradar.comright some ask for id and thenand then some ask for just a phonenumber some ask for bothyeah which and obviously the the onesthat just ask for the phone number arethe better ones because you can spoofthat with services like textverified.comwhere you can just get kind of a burnernumber uh to satisfy the atm's umuh you know phone number requirementsbut obviously that's not tied to to yourpersonal identityum and then before we continue before wecontinue since we're still like early inthe episode and i should have mentionedin the beginning uh bitcoin q a has uhmy favorite guides in the space so ifyou want to look up somethingspecifically or if you prefer readingum if you go to bitcoiner.guidehe has all of his guides listed there sojust keep that in mind okay continueyeah pretty much everything that we'retalking about i've got some uhsome form of information on it um soyeah moving on to other noko i seeopportunities um so we've covered uhpeer-to-peer peer-to-peer exchangeswe've covered atms and the the next sortof option is to uh is to earn it umwhich might sound a bit outlandish tosome people are new and entering thespace but also we'll say is thatumeverybody has some form of a uniqueskill um and there's always going to besomebody who needs umwhat you can offer them uh it's justabout sort of uh trying to build up abit of a reputation whether that's inyour local area or online and so thatyou canyou knowsell your time or your skills andknowledge um and receive satsin in in repayment for themand the other option again probably notas much of a beginner optionas i would like it to be but the otheroption is to mine itumalthough home mining does seem to begoing through somewhat of a renaissancewhich is really really great to see andso the the general premise of that isthat you canbuy a bitcoin miner you can plug thatinto your um outlet at home plug in anethernet port connect up to to a miningpool and stream yourself somesecret sats or some private no kyc satsuh directly again into your wallet thatyou control umthere's been you know a fair bit of foodbanded around that home mining is iskind oftoo difficult or it's too expensive umthe the thing i would say is that yeahit's very much dependent on yourelectricity prices um but again you knowthis this shows fairly us centric andthere's a lot of places in the u.s whereyou know and if you'reum earning anywhere less than i thinkyou knownails in the chat they'll probablycorrect me on this but i think you'reprofitable mine at the moment anywherebelow 30 sats 30 shots yeah so i meanwith with all of these techniques youmight be spending a little bit moremoney than you would beum if you went through one of theseregulated services um you'rethe way i justify it is i mean you'reyou're paying a little bit of a premiumfor privacyand you're paying that for privacy goingforward too so it keeps paying dividendsuh with mining specifically mining homemining is a fantastic wayuh in my opinion ofaccumulating kyc free setsumit's really nice because once you haveit plugged in it's just constantly goingyou don't even have to really thinkabout it just constantly bringing inmore sets um we already have two wholemining umcivil dispatches so if you go back ifyou go to civildispatch.comor if you go through the podcast feed orif you go to bitcointv.com and ourplaylist over there you can find thoseepisodes and we're about to have a thirdone too uhi think november 30th there's gonna be athird home mining episode so if that'ssomething that interests you you shouldgo check those out uh starting with thefirst one uh because we literally spentlike three hours on all the differenttrade-offs thereyeah just to come back on on somethingthat you said about um generallyspeaking you're absolutely right thatyou're gonna pay uma little bit more for uh noko ac satsyou know especially if you go to thepeer-to-peer exchangesum but i just i like to try and reframeit and you know it's not a a no kycpremium and the theprice that you see on a kyc exchange ilike to call it the um the discount thatyou get given um for giving up yourpersonal information and puttingyourself uh a little bit more at riskthan versus uh getting some sats thatare not tied to your identity so i thinkthat's like that useful framing yeah thereal price is the private way and thenexactly discount if you sacrifice yourprivacyum and then one method that you didn'tmention which isprobably the most uh accessible to newcoinersis if you have a friend or a couplefriends that are interested in bitcoinand they've been in bitcoin for a whileum obviously if you can if you can paythem cash for some of their bitcoinum that is the most private uhi wouldn't say the most private but it'sdefinitely the most accessible privateway for a new coinerand if they if they don't want to sellyou any they might know someone whowants to sell some soum that's always something to keep inmind cashin person isextremely gives you very good privacyguarantees periodumwhat else also like if you knowto the to the bitcoiners out therelistening to this uh showum you know guide your new cornerfriends in throughthat kind of method right and whether ornot you want to actually explicitly sellit to them that's one thing butyou know if you if you go out to dinnerhave them pay for dinner with their withtheir cash or their credit card and thenpay them back in bitcoin orgive them you know birthday gifts inbitcoin and like get them started in apeer-to-peer fashion rather than justthrowing them to the wolves and sendingthem to a regulated exchangeyeah there's a couple of people in thechat that have just uh rightfullyshouted out um as techo vouchers as welland which is essentially uh you'll getsort of stores uh that sort of sign upto become an azteco um sort of vendorand you can go in hand over some cashand you'll get sort of a voucher whereyou can go and claim the the equivalentamount of sats from that again directlyinto a wallet that you controlthe the the other caveat the sorry theonly caveat with azteco is that thethe sort of uh kyc responsibility if anyis put onto the specific vendor so itwon't just be you know don't justpresume that because there's an articleum vendor near you that it won't be nokyc uh each one is sort ofuh left to kind ofcome up with the their owninterpretation of whether they need todo it or not basicallyand you have that major chain in you inthe uk that's an azteca vendor rightwhat's the name of thatit was poundland but then it stopped acouple of months ago and it's showing nosigns of coming back unfortunately uhokay so as they realized what was goingon they're like ah we can't too muchliabilitywhich was a shame because they they havea store in literally every town therewas hundreds of them and it was massivefor the uk but yeah unfortunate to knowmore okay well that's a shame um if youwant toread more aboutthe dangers of kyc you can go to bitcoinq a's website no kyc only dot comumhowever you decide to proceed withobtaining bitcoin and accumulatingbitcoinum the next step istrying to secure it uhsecure it well and secure it in a waythat you don't have to trust a thirdparty uh who can seize your fundsum so how shouldhow should bitcoiners how should newcoiners go about that bitcoin q awhat are their optionsthe natural uh first step for mostpeople unfortunately like we've justsaid is is um a centralized exchangeagain like coinbase cash app or someonesomething like thatwhere you will go on deposit dollars oryour local currency they will uh sort ofcredit your account with you know theequivalent amount of statswhat you have there is um an iouwhere you've got an account with themwhere they say that you've got this muchbitcoin essentially what you actuallyhave in real terms is uh well it's aniou and you don't actually hold anybitcointhe the sort of uh very essence ofbitcoin is the uh that you know thatgoes to say you're not your keys notyour coins which is banded around a hellof a lot and for good reason and itessentially means that if you're notholding the keys for your bitcoin uh youdon't actually have any bitcoinso you bought someone in exchange um thethe next step would be to get yourselfum a mobile walletwhere you can uh generate the keys uhwithin that wallet um so that your youand only you are in control of uh any ofthe bitcoin that you send to that walletum so before we before we move on andi'm sorry that i keep cutting you off ii hope i hope it's uh fine with youbefore you move on umso so the risk is if you're holding itif you're holding it in one of thesecustodial wallets which is what theexchanges default toum and there's some other services thatalso are custodial walletsumbasically the telltale sign of that isthe way you access it is through ausername and passwordumyou don't have any backup yourself whathappens there is there's a highlikelihood that your account could getfrozen we've seen that with paypal inthe past with fiat with just us dollarswhere paypal will freeze your accountand you're not able to get your moneyum it could be stolen if the exchangegets compromised or the custodial walletgets compromisedum and obviously you're trusting yourprivacy completely with the custodianbecause they know all of yourtransactions and your current balancesso it's not idealum and you want to learn how to holdbitcoin yourself becauseone of the revolutionary things aboutbitcoin is that you can hold it yourselfin a way thatumsomeone has to physically compromise youuh to to take your bitcoinum soi guess you're about to start withmobile wallets i think mobile walletsare the most accessible way getting awallet on your phone basicallyum to hold your bitcoin for you rightyeah just before i get down to themobile wallet it comes back to the pointi made earlier about censorshipresistant or being able to make thepayments thatum you know you want to make not thatthey give you permission to to make umif you've got to uh ask for permissionfrom an exchange to be able to sendbitcoin to your desired destination umyou know you're asking for permissionand you know that's not why we're herewe want to be able to spend our money towhoever we want whenever we want sofirst step and the easiest step is toget a phone wallet you know they're freethey're easy to access you know you candownload from any popular app store orquite a lot of them offer umdirect downloads so that you canuh download from the the you know thechosen teams umwebsite or or github umthe a lot of people tend to rush in andtry and buy um you know the next besthardware wallet straight away whenthey've just bought sort of 100 ofbitcoin to dip their toes in a littlebitwell if you you know if you're justdipping your toes in to see if thisthing's uh working for you then itdoesn't make any sense to you know goout and buy a hardware wallet and thisis coming for somebody who works for ahardware wallet company um it doesn'tmake any sense to go out rush out andbuy acouple hundred dollars on a hardwarewallet when you own less than that inbitcoin so that's why you already have aperfectly good phone that you carryaround with you it's very easy to spendand receive fromum but the important thing here is thatyou use a reputable mobile walletthere's a lot of scammy mobile walletsdon't just open up the app store andsearch for bitcoin wallet you will get alot of bad options thereyeah the the unfortunately the the top10 um results for that sort of search inmost of the app stores are quite abysmalmy personal recommendations would besamurai wallet if you're an android useruh or blue wallet or if you're an iosuser uh moon wallet is also another onethat i know you're pretty bullish onthat as well yeah both blue wallet andmoon wallet that's with 2us m-u-u-n areavailable on both android and iosumthey'rethey're very easy to use for beginnersuh i i would say they're not veryintimidating umso don't be intimidated you shoulddownload one just try itso the the kind of general premise ofthese and unfortunately i mentioned moonwallet there it's gonna umit's gonna book the trend of what i'mabout to say but the general premise isyou'll download the app from your chosenlocation uh the the app when you set upa new wallet the app will show you alist of 12 or 24 words which is yourmaster secret um you know which is thethe master backup to your to yourbitcoin wallet anybody that gets theirhands on that and be that physically ordigitally um is going to be able to takeall of your fundsso make sure that you write that downand secure it somewhere um safe andthenso moon wallet has a different backupmethod um it'll prompt you and explainhow to back up that butwe will focus on this standard which issomething we call seed words which isthey're basically these wordsit's a phraseand the wallet generates it for you andyou need to keep them secret youabsolutely need to keep them secret soyou don't want to put them on aninternet connected device you put themon you don't want to like save them inyour icloud notes folder you don't wantto take a screenshot and upload it toicloud what you want to do is at thebare minimum you want to write it downon a piece of paper double check thatyou wrote it down correctly store itsomewhere securely because if someonegets access to it they have access toyour funds but as long as you have thosewordsyour phone you could drop your phone inthe toilet it could fall you know itcould fall and crack and break or justcompletely justyou know some phones just like stopworking sometimesas long as you have those seed words youcan reinstall the app on a new deviceand just put in those words put in thatphrase words and you will have access toyour fundsyeah and the beauty of that is like yousaid most of the you know 99 of thewallets umin the space all sort of work to thatsame standard so you know you wouldn'tnecessarily have to even uhdownload the exact same mobile wallet aslong as the mobile wallet that youchoose umit abides by the rules which again mostof them do then you can sort of put thatseed phrase into into any other walletand there's a quick question in the chatwhich i think is probably good to touchon before we move on to hardware walletsandsomebody asked how much would you needto own to get a hardware walletnow obviously i'm not going to be ableto answer that for the for everybodythat that's watching you know it's quitean individual questionand all i would say is you knowif it's yourthe only mobile wallet you've gottenit's on your daily phone i would use theequivalent of how much cash would youphysical cash would you carry aroundwith you um you know what's your limitat which it's gonna start um affectingyour life if you used to lose thatbalance umthe quick review the mobile wallet themobile wallet should be like almostconsideredis is like your spending wallet what youwould have right inin in your back pocket but uhgoing further when we go into moremethods of storing your bitcoin thatwould be more like a savings accountum except i you're about to say a caveatuh i mean i have my own caveat i wouldsayi thinkespecially if you're using a reputableonei think people can feel a little bitmore comfortable than the kind of amountof cash they would carry in their pocketum i know like i wouldn't feel morecomfortable i wouldn't feel thatcomfortable carrying more than like 400in my pocketum but like a mobile wallet especiallyif it's your first wallet you're justgetting started you're gettingcomfortable you have your seed wordsbacked upuh your phone's up to dateyou know we don't seehacks are theoretically possibleobviously phones get compromised all thetimeumbut i i would probably if i had to picka number i'd like being like the 5 000to 10 000 rangelike that's where you start having toreallyconsider securing it moreum and you should also operate under theassumption because bitcoin tends togo up fastumyou should be prepared ahead of timebecause it could beyou know it could be a thousand dollarsin there and then in six months it couldbe worth eight thousand dollarsyeah the the other thing i would say aswell is that thisalmost everybody has got a spare phonelying around at the house that you knowyou could use that as your sort ofdedicated bitcoin phone and where youcouldbe slightly more comfortable storing youknow maybe larger amountsrelative to the individual and and thenyou could kind of decant off into yoursort of daily phone what you might wantto spend on a day-to-day basisabsolutely nothing wrong with thatapproach as well if you didn't want toand shell out quickly for for umfor a hardware wallet which we can wecan come on to now and so hardwarewallet is well before we get to hardwarewallets you also havethere's also software wallets on on thecomputer that you can haveright so you have mobile wallets youhave software wallets on your computerwhere it's like you install an app onyour computerumi i mean i would saylike unless you're an advanced user andyou have like a dedicated computer andthis episode isn't for advanced usersthey should probably shy away from thatin the beginning i i think the mobilesecurity model is a stronger securitymodel as you know as long as you're notworried about like the nsa or somethingum or like the chinese intelligenceservicesor these intelligence services um mostmost of the population uh are not greatat securing their their computer uh mostpeople's computers are unless you'resort ofa bit of a hacker man there's this youknow a far more vulnerable device thanyour mobile phone iswhich is why like you said you know icompletely agree that i don't recommendthem especially for larger amounts umand i tend to sort of skip straight tothe hardware wallet after the mobilewallet stageumsohardware wallets um are essentially adedicated uh physical deviceum designed to manage the the keys thatcontrol your bitcoin um so with thembeing a a physical dedicated device youknow their one purpose is to secure yourbitcoin whereas your phone hasyou know it's essentially a computer inyour pocket and with all of that extrafunctionality that your phone hascompared to a hardware walletincreases the theoretical attack vectorswhere hackers orthe nsa whoever can umsort of try and attempt to get theirhands on your bitcoin so these devicesare very focused andthey're focused at securing your bitcoinfrom physical attack um and also uh fromum digital attack ie uh you knowsomebody stealing your keys um over theinternet if you were to connect one ofthese devices to your uhvery likely highly insecure computerumso they a lot of them most of the goodones um work uh you know that theirprimary umway of of sort of keeping things secureis that they operate with what's knownas an air gap where they they canoperate without being connectedphysically to to any other device andbecauseit's that physical umconnection that sometimes can introduceuh uh intro um extrathreat factors so the the idea just todistill it here like the idea of ahardware wallet is that you have aa device that's builtto securely hold your bitcoin welltechnically it's holding the keys toyour bitcoinum butfor all intents and purposes it's it'syou can think of it as holding yourbitcoin and and it interacts with eitheryour computer or your phone in a waythat those keysall the keys are what protect yourbitcoin gives you access to bitcoin andyou don't want someone else to haveaccess to those keys it keeps those keysoff that computer or off that phone soit stays on the deviceand that device is never connected tothe internet sothethe basic concept behind securingyour stash with a hardware wallet isthatuh for someone to compromise you theyneed to physically have access to youand the device orif they can compromise the device justthe device but they like have to comeinto your home or come into your officeand get that device rather than hackingyou through the internetright and you know the even um if ageneric attacker was togain physical access to to most of thesedevices and they're still going to um afair bit of time and a hell of a lot ofequipment to be able to um you knowcrack theum protections on the device to be abletoaccess the keys um and to be able tosteal your bitcoin so it's not just acase of umprotecting you from a malware infestedcomputer um if somebody was to break inthere's still pin protection on thedevice and so it's not just a case ifyou lose the device um and you loseaccess to your bitcoin again the thepremise that matt spoke about beforeabout writing down your seed words um isexactly the same with a hardware walletuh the differences here is that um thethe when you sort of uh generate thosethose 24 or 12 words and it's done in anoffline environment that's never beenconnected to the internet so that againit just removes that extra threat vectorwhere um you're not connected to anysort ofinternet connected devices so it's justthat extra layer or wrapper of securityperfectumshould wewhat is your favorite hardware walleti saw that one coming a mile offum so full disclosure um i work for a umhardware wallet manufacturer calledfoundation devicesand obvious biases aside i genuinelybelieve that we make the umthe best option for a beginner enteringthe space umit's incredibly secure but also veryeasy to operate uh so i should havenamed the devices called passport andand another great device is the callcard umwhich is probably looks a little bitscarier to the newcomer i would say umbut has some extra features um thatmight bemore beneficial for more advanced usersthat they could sort of leverage sothose would be my two favorites yeah iwould say my favorite is uh cold cardumi've used multiple versions of coldcards i highly recommend them umand then ifwe're not really going to go intocoins here but if youabsolutely need to gamble onother coins in the space rather thanjust bitcoin uh both foundation and coldcard are bitcoin onlyumi mean so i i would say either use aledger or a treasureuh hardware wallet if if you wantcoin support um but even in thatsituation you probably shouldgo with a bitcoin only hardware walletfor your bitcoin and then use the otherones for your coins and just likethe mobile wallets there are lots ofreally bad harder wallets out thereso don't just googlebest hardware wallet because a lot ofinfluencers are paidtopromote them so you'll see youtubevideos with 500 000 views saying to usea horrible hardware wallet soconsider thatyeah what i would say just to back thatup again is that you know likelihood isif you're listening to this that you'reat least aware um ofyou know bitcoin twitter and the peoplethat are umaround and popular on there and most ofthose people have been around for a goodnumber of years and they've probablytried all of these devices so look towhat most most of theirmost of those people are using or atleast recommended and when you're sortof doing your own research to see whichdevice is going to be best for youperfectumwhen they're using their hardware walletthey need to use it with awith software they need to use it withan appso what are your recommendations forwhich apps they should use with theirhardware walletthe best two for meif you want to stay on desktop whichgenerally gives you sort of a little bitmore extra functionality would be numberone be spiral wallet um hands down myfavorite umor if you like a little bit of a sort ofeasier to to operate interface with kindof lessadvanced features spectre desktop isalso a great onetwo great recommendations spectre usedto be my favorite now sparrow's myfavoriteyeah um whichmight uh be a good segue for what we'vegot coming up next uh well before we getthereyou can also useyou can also use both the cold card andthe foundation passport with blue walleton mobile so if youare going through the steps and you gotcomfortable with blue wallet alreadyum because you started with a mobilewallet uh you can then use blue walletwith both of those hardware walletswhich is nice especially i mean i ithink some people listening to thisprobably don't have a computer that'sso a lot of people don't have computersthey just have the computer in theirpocketyeah you know we're heading towards amobile first world aren't we if not ifwe're not already there and blue walletdoesoffer a great interface uh especially uhwith with the with the passport with theqr interfaces uh very very slick andvery easy to wrap your head around as abeginnerawesome okay so you want to go to thenext topicyou said yeah let'slet's hit nodes yeah so i talked aboutum inspector desktop and one of thegreat features about like the desktop isit actually has a built-in bitcoin nodeso uh the next step along your journeyuh hopefully will be to look to run yourown bitcoin nodeum a bitcoin node is you can look at itas your umsort of interface into your into thebitcoin world and it's going to be thatnext step along the sovereignty journeyso that you can and again one of the thebuzz phrases that you hear in the spaceis verify your own transactionsand so when you receive uh any bitcointransactionand that will bebeing passed to you via a whole networkof nodesand the wallet that you choose to usewill be connected to a node now thatnode could be uma centralized node or operated by anexchange uh it could bea node that you don't know who existsthat might actually be a chainsurveillance company or hopefully itcould be your own node that you can runum in your house relatively cheaplynow the benefits of of running your ownnode like i said is you can verify yourown transactions so that you can be surewhen somebody's sending you atransaction and that the transactionabides bythe this sort of rule set umthat the the network that you've chosento join umthat we all agree on uh to put that alittle bit simplea little bit simpler is that you canbe sure that sort of nobody's trying tocheat you and send you some fake bitcoinor a transaction that's not valid and sothat you know you might be selling goodsor services and they might be paying youin bitcoin for thatandand if you weren't verifying your owntransactions they might be able to umsend you um the way i like to frame itis it's using your own note to interactwith the bitcoin network you have to usea node and if you don't use your ownnodeumyou don't have counterfeit detection isis like kind of how i like to view itsomeone can kind of trick youuh into it into thinking you havebitcoin when you don't have bitcoin soyou want to use your own node for thatpurpose and then second of all which ithink is almost more tangible to peoplebecause to be honest uh we haven't seenthat's more of a theoretical attack andwe haven't really seen it play out itcould still play out in the future youshould assume it it will so you want touse your own node for counterfeitdetection but second of all it alsoif you don't use your own node um you'retrusting your privacy with whoever'snode you're using so you want to useyour own node so that you don't have totrusta potential potentially a stranger or acompanywith that that private transactioninformation and balance informationyeah it's about removing trustessentially and and by running your ownnode you're you're putting the trust inthe hardware and or the the softwarethat you are choosing to run uh not theone that's kind of been given to you ifyou're operating with an exchange or acentralized node runner and so there'suma a massive awash of choice and withvarying degrees oftechnical abilitythe the easiest way to get running withyour own nodeis to download a piece of softwarecalled bitcoin corethis is kind of the the sort of uh defacto software built by the the bitcoincore developers uh that is essentially apiece of software that you can in acouple of clicks download onto yourlaptop or desktop and and it will startto download the your own copy of theblockchain so that you can umtransact with the built-in wallet andto just to get started and verify yourown transaction that way that'sabsolutely the easiest way and as itouched on earlier uh spectre desktopactually has umessentially that built in as well justpackaged in a slightly different way foryou and so they're they're absolutelyfree and within a couple of clicksyou'll be on the way to downloading yourown copy of the blockchain and havingyour own node set upthe problem with a setup like that isthat umyou i can't really um generally speakingconnect any mobile wallets to it so ifyou were to want to transact when you'reout and about and you run bitcoin coreon your laptopand you wanted to send the transactionthe likelihood is you're not gonna haveyour laptop with you so you you know youwon't be able to to spend as easily assome of the node options that we'regoing to come up come on to uh in asecond i'll just pause see if matt's gotanything to add thereumyeah so i mean if you're using bitcoincore or if you're using the built-inbitcoin core inspectoruh yeah correct your you can't the mainnegative is you can't use it with themobile wallet the also the othernegative isum your transaction and balance infowill be on your computer so if it'sa computer you use for work or acomputer you use uhto play games or look at porn orsomething like that your social mediahabitit might be easily compromised and thatbecomes a it becomes mostly it becomes aprivacy issueumbecause all your transaction historywill be there and all of your balancehistory will be thereum but also you can't use it with mobilewallets which is a key component as wellyeah so so the next best option um andunfortunately the most expensive optionis what's known as a plug and play nodeso this is where you'll buyessentially a small box from one of thevarious teamsto name a few we've got uh ronin dojowe've got raspi blitz we've got startnine uh umbrell there's loads ofdifferent companies or my nodeno nothere's loads popping up um all withdifferent feature sets but essentiallythey sell your boxuh that you plug in at home you plug itinto your router you plug it into thepower outletand then within a couple of clicksyou're off and running again to to getyour own copy of the blockchain and haveyour no your own node up and runningand before we move on uh civil dispatchuhcivil dispatch 26i had all the major node teams on for aconversation ontheir node projects so if you'reinterested in having one of thesepurpose-built boxes or you a lot ofthose projects that were just namedallow you to actually buy the hardwareseparatelyand then install their software on it umconsider listening to that sill dispatchright so and the the kind of finaloption is the diy approach like matt'sjust touched on where all of theprojects that we just said and we'llhave a parts list you can go away andbuyspend a couple hundred dollars buying ahard drive and a single board computerand a couple of other cablesand build your own node and put your ownsoftware well put the software thatthese teams provideand onto that hardware uh the the endresult is that you get um the same nodewith all the same features um obviouslythe caveat is that you've got to gothrough the process of buying thehardware yourself flashing the softwareand onto a micro sd card uh which mightcause you some you know if you're a lesstechnical user and you're lesscomfortable with taking that approachand that's why the teams offer theplug-and-play note it does sound moreintimidating than it actually isand i would absolutelyso like i encourage new users to gettheir feet wet um also juston thejust to go back a little bit aboutbitcoin core i mean if you're using youcan use you can also use bitcoin core ifyou're running bitcoin core on the samecomputer you're running spectre on or asparrow they both can connect to itumif you do that process you really shouldbe using it on a dedicated computer iknow i like kind of touched on thatearlier when i said you know if you'reusing it for playing games or socialmediait could get compromised easier becauseyou're using it for all these othergeneral purposes you're downloadingsoftware on it that maybe you haven'tverified you definitely haven't verifiedand have no idea what's really runningthereum so if you are going to go thatapproachyou should have a dedicated device youshould consider a dedicated computer adedicated phone that you are using withit um and uhyeah in general dedicated devices areare going to be more secure and moreprivate you'rewhen we when we talk about security andbitcoin land whereyou don't don't let perfect be the enemyof good don't get overwhelmed becauseyour setup's not perfect but at the sametime you're just trying toreduce your threats so that you're notthe lowest hanging fruit most of thetime when we see these hacks it'stargeted at the people that are mostvulnerableyeah and the just to go back to the diyapproach that was outlining umall of these uh different projects thatwe've spoken about have got reallyreally good documentation and quitevibrant communities as well uh ontwitter telegram or their own dedicatedforum and so don't be afraid to you knowgo and have a browser the documentationlike matt said it's not actually asscary as i made it sound um and also youknow go and ask some questions in the inthe telegram chat or in the slack orwhatever you know um chat room that thethe the project has gotum you'll probably find or you'lldefinitely find thatall of these the people that are inthese communities are really welcomingand they've definitely been in yourposition before now and and you knowthey they found uh the thought of thisreally scary a couple of years ago andyou know now they might be runningseveral diy notes so they'll be don't beoff-put by it100um i will echo that sentiment i wouldjust add a slight caveat that there arescammers in these telegram groups andthese chat rooms um they will often tryand impersonateuhpeople that are involved with theproject or other notable figures to tryand get you feel comfortable never nevergive anybody uh your seed words thosesecret backup boards never give themtheir secret backup boardsand you know always be skeptical ifsomeone in one of those groups tries todm you separately and tries to go into aprivate chat you know sometimes it islegit but you need to be extra cautiousin that type of situationyeah and and if somebody does don't beafraid to ask in in the sort of mainroom you know tag the person who youthink might have dmd you and said isthat his issue at the mme exactly butalways uh just act on the the on air onthe side of caution and and keep thatsort of adversarial mindset to think youknow why is this person reaching out tome completely out of the blue after ijust asked my first question enteringthe room100um so all those node projectssupport something called electrum serverand electrum server is a standardumit's it's a standard way to interactwith your own node um you can use thoseelectrum server details and then you canput them into sparrowyou can put them into many of the mobilewallets that we mentioned earlier youcan put them into blue walletwith samurai specificallythey don't use electrum server they usesomething calleddojoand with that pairing is as simple asthere's a qr code and you just scan theqr code with your samurai wallet on yourphone and it'll pair up with your nodeyeah the good thing is with dojo as wellis it's uh implemented in the vastmajority of the the note packages nowthere's there's more that have dojo thatthen don't which is really great to seeindeedshould we hit on the coin joinokay soi i just want you know we're we're anhour inum if you're a newcomer you just listento this hour and you're intimidated as uh don't be intimidated you knowstart with step one where we talkedabout acquiring your bitcoinumthen you know learn how to hold your ownkeys and slowly move through the processdon't you know freak yourself out thatyou know now now i gotta run a node toolike i'm now i'm really intimidated youknow step by step get your feet wet getcomfortable send transactions receivetransactions back up your wallet restoreyour wallet just get comfortable with itget used to it don't it's not somethingto be scared of it's something that youlearn by doingyeah i uh i put a tweet a couple ofweeks ago actually that kind of echoesthat that you know if uh sending atransaction uh makes you feel a littlebit uneasy then you haven't sent enoughtransactions um you can see on screenthere that the mempool is uh you knowit's a little bit busy than what it wasbut a couple of sats per bite is goingto get your transaction confirmed veryquickly and that's going to cost you youknow less than a dollar to send atransaction so we don't have we don'thave that on the list but before we moveon to coin join on chain privacyutxo management we should probablyhow does how does a newcomer choose whatfee to pay they open up their walletthey go to send a transactionumwhat like how do bitcoin transactionfees work i feel like that is somethingwe tend to gloss overyeah we overlooked that one um wellfortunately most of the the good mobilewallets especially the ones that we'veuh mentioned uh on tonight's stream uhwill give you a couple of options uhwhere you canum you'll they'll either have you knowthree options sort of low prioritymedium priority and high priority likeagain like we can see on screen or theremight be a slider where you can manuallyadjust the feeand essentially the the higher that thefee you pay the more likely that uh yourtransaction is going to be uh confirmedor processed quickeruh againa caveat with that one we've got a lotof caveats tonight is that umthe uh some of the estimation the feeestimations umthese wallets all use different sort ofalgorithms as to how they um calculateor estimate the fee that would berequired to get you confirmed in thedisplayed priorityso matt's got on screen here a reallygreatwebsite called mempool.spaceum which can it shows you again the thepriority uh fee selections uh or what itwould adviseand based on uh correct me from wronggame map but based on what's currentlyin the mempool um as well as sort ofhistorical data as well so it's kind ofaalways a really good sort of accuratelook at you know if you want to get yourtransaction processed within the nextblock uh right now it would take anestimate of 13 sats per byte um butagain there's a little caveat here thatthere's still umtransactions with much lower transactionfees umthan 13 sats per byte that will also getget confirmed so it's kind of umit's not an exact science uh i will saythatbut multiple sources is always a goodone if you want to try and uhget it sort of nailed so i mean bitcoinis a run by a companybitcoin is adistributed networkum and so as a result how bitcointransactions workiswe have this chain of transactionsand the transactions are within blockswe call them blocksumroughly every 10 minutes there'll be anew bitcoin block and it will havefinalized transactions included in thatblockuntil you get into a blockyou sit in a waiting list that waitinglistis we call that the mempool we call itamenpool technically every node hastheir own mempoolumbut if your internet connection is solidin most situations those mempools shouldall look the same so when you go tomempool.space you're looking at theirmempool that will look very similar toif you looked at the same thing on yourown node which a lot of these nodeprojects by the way allow you to runmempool.space natively with your ownnodesothebasically you have this like free marketthat's constantly going on where you'redecide wherepeople are choosing which fee they'rewilling to spend and miners are going tousuallyinclude you in a block based on yourorder in that waiting list based on howmuch you want to spendso if it's a transaction between someoneyou trust um and you're willing to waita longer period of time you can pay alower fee if you're sending just toyourself you can pay the lowest fee wecall that's one sap per byte is thelowest fee because you're just sendingit to yourselfum you know if if in some crazysituation where a one sapper by nevergets confirmed ever which we've neverbeen through you can always resend thattransactionso you're gonna want touh choose your transaction fee based onthe urgency you want that transactionfinalized on the networkand most good wallets will basicallygive you a low medium and highyou knowthislow being i can wait medium being likei'm in the middle ground because it'smedium and high being i don't want towait i want it finalized as soon aspossibleyeah andit'sit's a very much a dynamic thing it'slike a queue that's always evolvingevery single second because there's moreand more transactions being sent youknow every second andumit's not within you know outside therealms of possibility thatwhat the fee that you put up right thissecondmight not be enough to get youimmediately uh processed into the nextblock in sort of five minutes timeum so it's it's very very dynamic andyou know that's why i said it's not sortof an exact science so generallyspeaking for most people the walletestimators are pretty good especially ifit's an urgent transaction that you needto be processedimmediately100 i'm glad we covered that topicum also uhjust uh before we move on to the nexttopic just to jump backwith hardware wallets uhyou know the backup to that hardwarewallet are those words you wrote downumyou have the option of putting them intosteel these steel plates are availablemany different vendors offer the steelplatesand the idea there is if you put it intosteel obviously it's going to be waterresistant and fire resistant it's goingto be more sturdy than paperyou might also consider makingduplicates of those seed words andhaving them in different places so likeif your office burns down or your houseburns down it's still in the otherlocationwith the caveat that it meansit could be more likely that someoneelse finds it because it's in morelocations so you need to think aboutthat very carefullyand then third of all with hardwarewallets which i forgot to mentionone thing i like to tell new coinersis it's a good idea to have to buy twoof whatever you decide to buybecause if you have a second oneyou canyou can have the same backup wordsinitialized on both devicesso then if something happens to yourdevice not only do you have the seedwords available those those secretbackup words available to restore yourdevice you also have the second devicethat still has access to your funds soyou're not in a panic situationum so i always i tend to recommend topeople that they should buy two of thesame device whichever they choose umso that they they can have twoinitialize and you can keep those inseparate locations as wellif you wantokay yeah i think that's good adviceso when you're opening up a bitcoinwallet it shows a balanceum a common misconception isthatthat you know you just it shows yourbitcoin balance that's what's in yourwallet but in reality what's in yourwallet is basically a bunch of differentbitcoin transactions that all add up tothat balanceum we call those utxos uhthose those are unspent transactionoutputs utxos is what we call them youcan think of them like bills in yourwallet like maybe your wallet you knowyour cash wallet has50 in it but in reality it has two 20sand a 10and that's how bitcoin wallets work soyou have all these small utxos in therethat add up to your balance and that hasprivacy implicationsbecause ififtwo of those utxos come togetherum in a single transaction they'reobviously linked on this chainuh forever right we call it theblockchain it's this ledger oftransactions they'll be linked togetherbecause they were both spent in the sametransactionso that brings us to this idea of utxomanagementand coin control the idea oftrying tomanage thosebitcoin transactions in a privacy andcost effective way should you want to gointo that a little bityeah definitely um and quick i willstart with the two wallets that we keepmentioning blue wallet and samurai umoffer all the features that i'm justabout to cover that sort of help when itwhen it comes to to utxo managementandinspectoryeah sorry yeah i keep referring tomobile wallets but yeah the all of thedesktop uh the good desktop wallets thatwe've spoken about i've all got utxomanagement features as well um sothere's a couple of facets to it thefirst one is the ability to uh label thethe utxos or the pieces of bitcoin thatyou've got in your wallet so what wouldbe an example of a label might be thatif matt was to pay me for dinner uh orpay me back for dinner um when ireceived that transaction into my walleti could put a label on that to say thatthat's come from martin it was fordinnerum i could then receive my wages from myemployerumand i could put the the relevant labelon that just to know that where theorigin uhof that utxo is fromumso the once i've labeled themwhen i'm making future transactionsand i'mthere's two ways you can make atransaction you can let the wallet toconstruct it for you automatically whichthey might choose any random utxos andmerge them together again like matt saidto which will show common ownership thatmight not be a problem however if you uhwant to preserve your privacy and imight not want my employer to know thati'm friends with matt because he's a badperson um because i've labeled those i'mnot a bad person thoughbecause i play radical[Music]because i've labeled those utxos when ireceived them at the time um in you knowtwo weeks down the line when i'm goingto make a transaction um i can then chyou know consider and the person thati'm paying you know do i want them toknow that i know matt or do i want themto know that i work for the company thatpaid me uh with this utxo i can makethat informed decision then to say wellactually i'm just going to spend fromone of those pieces of bitcoin oractually it's not a bad thing matt's notreally a bad person i'm gonna combinethe two uh because the value that i wantto send i need to combine the twoum so those are the two two sort of mainfacets to it and and but obviously youcan't ummake a an informed decision when youcome to spend um if you don't know theorigins of all of the etxos that you'vegot and so they kind of go hand in handreally um you need to label so that whenyou come to spend you can make theinformed decision as to whether youshould merge or not yeah so a key aspectof bitcoin isif someone sends you bitcointhey can see where that bitcoin goes inthe futureand if you receive bitcoin you can seewhere that bitcoin came from in the pastsothis is why labeling is importantbecause you want to knowwhere that transaction came fromor it goes tobecausethat's who you're exposing your privacyto in that situationis that a good yeah installation yeahwhich you know um might not be a problemfor you know the person that i'm payingmight not um be able toor be clever enough to to use blockchainanalysis um but the other sort of umadversary that we need to consider hereis chain analysis firms that might betrying to umcluster or monitor your unchain activitywho you're spending to who you'regetting change back from uh to monitoryour habits to try and um piece togetherumyou know the identity because theblockchain doesn't have any identitiesat that at the blockchain layer um butthese companies work to kind oftie all the pieces together so that theycan um de-anonymize people and so it'snot just a case of umyou know hiding how much you earn fromyour friend uh it's also you know thesemore sophisticated actors that have gotmore a lot more resources to throw atthis and that you've also got to bear inmind as well unfortunately yeah you bothyou both don't want you don't want youremployer to knowwhat you're spending things onand you don't want the guy who sells youa sandwich to know how much money youmakebut on top of that we also have theseprofessional surveillance mercenariesthat work for governments dictators andcompaniesand they are just out there constantlytrying to track bitcoin transactions soyou also have that as a concernwhich leads us nicely onto coinjoin ithink if unless there's anything elseyou want to touch on no let's yep we cantalk about coinjoin now so coinjoin umis um acoordinated or collaborative transactionwhereyou and at least one other personwillcollaborate to construct the transactionthat casts some doubtas to theorigin and the output of the transactionto umto make suream thatstill could you still hear mei can still hear you yes oh sorry ithought i dropped out yes it's acoinjoin is a collaborative transactionwhere umthe the idea is that theuh somebody watching the blockchainagain chain surveillance firm youremployer your friend whoever they can'tumdeterministically orwith good probability be able to trackthepeople on the input side of thetransaction to the output side of thetransactionso it effectively attempts to put upsort of um a brick wall in your you knowthe the utxos history so that umanybody looking on chain can't be sure100umyou know is there one person involved inthis transaction is there 10 peopleinvolved in this transaction it justcasts doubt on the the uh path that thebitcoin has taken and and who sort of umyou know has the bitcoin change handshasn't it we we're not really sure so sotracking bitcoin is a probability gameumthese surveillance companies and theirtools will basically or just someonewho's curious and trying to spy on youum will basically assign a probabilityto every transaction if ownership haschanged because one of the things aboutbitcoin isyou know i could send bitcoin to myselfor i could send it to bitcoin q a anduh the chain doesn't delineate betweenthat so a key aspect of tracking bitcointransactions isumdetermining some kind of probabilitythat bitcoin actually changed hands andthen from there trying to seewhich hands it went from from who to whoum so coinjoin is this idea of acollaborative transaction and you canthink of it likeumjust for an example if you have fivepeople that are doing a coin jointtogetherinstead of uh having a simple path thatyou're following on chain and decidingif ownership has changed um all of asudden there's five different potentialpaths it could go downyou don't know which of the five peoplethat participatedwhich of their five outputs are themso it breaks that probability chainand it's a useful tool in terms oftrying torecr to have forward privacy have thisidea of someone who sent you bitcoindoesn't necessarily know which path yourbitcoin took going forwardyeah and specifically with umimplementations of coinjoin likewhirlpool which are known as equaloutput coin joints um the the the sortof notion is that everybody um on theoutput side all of the utx on the outputside of the transactionlook absolutely identical and soit's kind of uh i always like to use theanalogy of v for vendetta where you'vegot the million mask marchit's essentially the same thing but onthe blockchain where all of these utxosare indistinguishable from one anotherand so like matt said you've got someforward privacyand be quickand soi the the three major coin jointprojects our samurai whirlpool joinedmarket in wasabiumcitadel dispatch 15 was with the wasabiteam civil dispatch 16was with the join market teamand civil dispatchi don't know where he is i also did asamurai oneum is citadel dispatchit's there in your feed somewhere youknow uhstefan can just rattle them off he knowsexactly which one is which always amazesme that umi don't know which one it is i'll comeback to it and tell you but it's there'sthere's another dispatch with thesamurai team so if you're interested inthis uh consider going back andlistening to those threeumme and bitcoin q auh like samurai whirlpool the best youcan also you you don't have to usesamurai walla with it you can usesparrow wallet with it as wellumyeah yeah co-sign that samurai orsparrow a hands-down win is for me umespecially from a from a beginner'sperspective um definitely the easiestones to get started with in my opinionyou can continue on i'm trying to figureout which dispatchi'lli'll cover off one quick question that'sum quite on topic and somebody askedwhat's the difference betweenum coinjoin that we've just spoken abouton a coin tumbler so the unfortunatelythe words uh or the the meanings havebeen kind of umwhitewashed somewhat over the years butum generally speaking a coin tumbler isa centralized service where you willhave tosend inyour bitcoin and give up a custody of itto whoever's running the tumbler andthey will send you somebody else'sbitcoin backand i absolutely wouldn't recommendanybody use thesebecause you're putting yourselfum completely in the hands of whoever'srunning the tumbler and that you knowwhether they're going to send you yourbitcoin back or notand yeah soand you also not only you're trustingthem with your bitcoin if you use acustodial mixer it's the same ideas ascustodyum because custodial risks with walletsum you're also you're trusting them withyour privacy and your fundsum so the key aspect of coinjoin is isthe idea that you are reducing trust inany kind of centralized third party umwasabi and samurai have a centralizedserver that they doum[Music]that they use to coordinate the coinjoins to make them easier better uxuh and more reliablethose coordinators are blindedwith samurai specifically you can use itwithout your own node and then you'retrusting samurai's node so that goesback to our earlier conversation aboutusing your own node you should use yourown node when you use samuraiotherwise you are trusting them withyour transaction and balance informationas as is the case with all light walletsum i found it so so it's still dispatch15 is wasabi still dispatch 16 is joinedmarket and still dispatch 30 is samuraiso consider listening to thoseokay i think are we done on coinjsshould we move on to the next topic um ihave multisig as the next topic butshould we do lightning real quick firstsure thing yeah yeah i think it's apt umsoquick high level on what the thelightning network is uh it is a scalingsolution for bitcoin that umallows you toum transact with uhactual real bitcoin um but you don't doso with what's known as an on-chainfootprint and so it allows you to sortof lock up a small amount of well asmuch bitcoin as you want onto thissecond layer solution known as thelightning networkso that you can umyou essentially just defer the theoverall settlement um of any number oftransactions from going on chain to toreduce fees and also to allow you totransact um much quickerso whereas uh one on chain transactionyou know might cost you a couple hundredsats depending on the fees and you youmight be able to send you know 10or even 100lightning network um transactions forthe sameuh for the same amount of fees um nowthere is uhunfortunately lots of caveats with thelightning network again in terms ofbeing able to do it properly uh with uhthe best way to do so be with one of theuh no packages that we've spoken aboutbefore andwhich will dictate that you need tomanage your own sort ofyour own channels which is essentiallywhere you lock up this bitcoin to beable to to transact on this second layerumso it's a little bit more of a hurdle toto get on board with um but you you sortof can save yourself a fair bit on feesespecially if we ever see a feast bikeagain um which i think is inevitable umthe i don't knowinevitable um sofirst of all there's been a lot ofdispatches on lightning if you gothrough the feedconsider listening to those there's likea lot of different caveats and nuanceswhen using lightningspecifically with privacy i did a fullprivacy episode with openobs and anthonythat's still dispatch 21 that's onlightning privacyuh so consider checking that out but themain differentiation that you as a newuser should think about with lightningis going back to our transaction feeconversation earlierwhich iswhen you use a regular bitcointransactionyour transaction fee is not based on theamount you send it could be kind ofweird for youuh it's it's actually based on theamount of utxos that you useuh for the transaction it's based on thedata size not the amount of money thatis sentsoyou could end up sending a five dollartransaction with bitcoin on chain aregular bitcoin transaction and it couldcost the same as sendinga five million dollar transactionnow with lightningit's different the way fees arecalculated on lightning is based on theamount you're sending so that'll be morecomparable to something that you're usedto in traditional finance world where ifyou send more money you're going to paya higher fee you send less money you'regoing to pay a lower feenowuh moon wallet with 2us as we talkedabout earlier mobile wallet supportslightningand blue wallet supports lightning nowif you use blue wallet in its defaultstate with lightning it's going to be acustodial walletwhich i don't loveuh if you insist on using it use it witha small amount because they can takeyour funds you are trusting them withyour privacy um ifuhyou can also use blue wallet withsomething called lnd hub which some ofthese node projects offeri think umbral and my node offered idon't know who else offers it but if youuse it with lnd hub or your friend's lndhub then it's not custodial with bluewallet it's custodial with who's everrunning the lnd hub so if you run thelnd hub yourselfthen it's not custodialotherother lightning specific wallets onmobilethat you can use so moon does bothblue wallet does boththen there's lightning specific mobilewallets that are very good uh there'sphoenixwallet uh there's breeze walletumbreeze b-r-e-e-zcontinuing the bitcoin naming scheme ofusing words and spelling themdifferently um is there anotherlightning wallet that i'm missinglightningeclair as well haven't youwell claire is phoenixphoenixyeah why do they have two okay but yeahboth of those are good yeah one allowsyou to manage your own channels and theother one does it for youokay phoenix does it for youyepokay so forget eclair your new corneryou have phoenix and you have breezewallet or you can use moon or bluewallet and that'srather than for savings you should thinkof that more asokay this is like my spending wallet mytransaction fees are based on the amounti send i'm going to be sending smalleramounts umso i i might use lightning rightyeah i agree i'm quite a big fan ofphoenix um especially from a perspectiveof you know one that a wallet thatmanages the channels for you and i mightget a lot of for this in the chatbut i'm i'm a firm believer that mostnew users don't shouldn't strive todive head first into lightning withtheir own channels because it's it'sit's not easy it's not approachable andeverything that we've already discussedum in terms of holding your own keys umuh using coinjoin and and not using kycare far more important than uh strivingto get your own channels up and runningum quickly uh i don't know what youthink about that matt and i'm waitingfor the in the chat no i mean ithink i i i think umlightning on mobile uh with the walletswe just mentioned moon blueum breeze phoenixfor smaller spending amountsuh is very accessibleuh actuallyif you if you actually want to dolightning in a proper sovereign wayum that i would say is a more advancedthing don't get intimidated by it but ii think it's important for ourall-encompassinggetting started guide that we do mentionit it exists and what are the you knowdifferent trade-offs basically thetrade-off there is a little bit you'regetting less security uh you're gettingless reliability with lightning umbut you're getting lower feesfaster transactions all else equalum[Music]and it could be very useful in a mobilespending type of situationyeah i agreephoenix and brees really great ways toto get started with lightning that havesort of their own unique um trade-offsuh that kind of give the the best ofboth worlds from it from a new userperspectivewhen you compare them with umcustodial solutions like the defaultblue wallet or running your own channelsand that's one of theyeah i mean that's one of the reasonswhy i like moon so much like moon with2us has like different tradeoffsum it doesn't have a standardized backupprocessuh it's you know if if you'rea lot of big corners will say it's youknow not a lightning wallet but at theend of the dayit's not a lightning wallet because youstore all your funds on chain you're notstoring it in a proper lightning walletum but what's cool about moon isif you scan a qr code it could be alightning qr code or it could be aregular bitcoin qr code and it justautomaticallyfigures that out for youum and and vice versa yeah so so you canjust have you can have some spendingcash in your moon wall at muunand whatever whatever bitcoin qr codeyou scan it will send but it doesn'thave power user features it doesn't havethat coin selection that we were talkingabout with utxo management it doesn'thave labelingit doesn't have a standard backupprocessso these are all things to keep in mindright multisig multisig let's let's gohere's where we get into the weeds alittle bit um right so you've been inthe weeds for a whileall of the uh wallets that we've spokenabout umthe desktop wallets mobile wallets alloperate umon what we colloquially call a singlesig setup where they have um a singlesecret or backup um which is requiredwhen you want to spend your bitcoin amulti-sig wallet is where you combinetwo or more of theseseparate wallets together to create abrand new walletwhen you set up this multisig wallet youcan dictatethe minimumamount of keys required to be able tomake ato sign or authorize a send transactionso that could betwo from a possible three keys is apopular one all the way up to somethingelaborate like 11 or 15 you know whichmight be uh used in sort of a businesssetting props um but two of three whereyou need two signers from a possiblethree that were created to that we useto create the wallet to sign off on anytransactions from that wallet so whywould you want to do that wellwith a single sig wallet and some of thethree theoretical attack vectors ifsomeone's to someone but somebody was tosteal your deviceand and umwhile you know if they snatch your phonewhile it's out of your hand and you'vegot your wallet unlocked um they cansteal your bitcoin if that was one ofthe keys in a multi-sig wallet where youneeded two to spend from then they can'tsteal anything from youumanother one of the attacks that multisigprotect from is known as a retirementattack where there might be a malicioushardware wallet vendor thatdoesn't publish their source code um andthey umhave some uhmalware baked into into the the into thedevice and that is actually uh has theability to stealyour bitcoin i will say again correct meif i'm wrong game out but that has neverhappened again it's a theoretical attackbut if you were to use um a multi-sigsetup where you've got differenthardware wallet manufacturers if one ofthose is is maliciousum they can't get access to your fundsbecause they don't have you know if it'sjust one key out of two that arerequired they don't have the uhthe minimum number of keys required tosteal anythingall the goodall the good wallets all the goodhardware wallets are open source sotheoretically open source meansthat the code is available for you toverifyum and you can read the code line byline nowif you're a new coiner you're probablyup to this point you're already reallyintimidated you're like matt i can'tread codei'm aware okaysoat the end of the dayit is very good that you're able totechnically verify the code but mostpeople will be updating their hardwarewallets and they will not be verifyingthe code so there is some trust that youare you're trusting that hardware walletmanufacturer to not ship uh maliciouscode to you and you're also trustingthemuh that that the actual device wasn'tcompromised when it was first sent toyou right so with multisig the idea isyou can have multiple but specificallyin a hardware wallet ida hardware wallet multisig the idea isyou can have multiple vendorsuh that aremultiple different hardware wallets thatcome together to form your walletandyou needa combination of them as bitcoin q a wassaying a common one is two of three youneed two of them to spend the fundsthis reduces trust in any specifichardware wallet manufactureryou also have the added benefituh that those backup words instead ofthose backup words being aumone and done situation if someone findsthose secret backup words we call themseed words if someone finds those wordsthey have access to your funds in amulti-sig setup you haveummultiple sets of backup words and theyhave to find the required threshold ofbackup wordsin order to spend your funds so ifyou're using a two of three you're gonnahave three sets of backup words you'regonna have three hardware walletsthose backup boards obviously can be onsteel as we said earlierum and you can have them in differentlocations so bitcoin gives you bitcoinwith multisig gives you this uniquesituationwhere you can have a geographicallydistributeduh security setup where you're holdingyour own coinbutthethe the keys to access it can be locatedin different places they can beduplicated you can keep copies of themin different places and for someone toactually compromise you and take yourfunds they're gonna need to have accessto a combination secretwe lost bitcoin q a about two minutesago or a minute and a half ago and i'mjust gonna keep talking until hereconnectssothat is the main benefit of multisig[Music]do not once again do not get intimidatedhereuhplenty of people store bitcoin in singlesig uh setups it is thenormal way of setting it upum this is something you might graduatetouh multisig ux multisigumi guess ux can be kind of a complicatedwordlike the way you interface with themultisig walletis a relativelynew thing in bitcoinumso it it has a little bit more of alearning curve it is a little bit morerough around the edgessoyou want to get really comfortable withit as i said earlier you want to bebacking up restoring spending receivinggetting comfortable with it separatelyof your single sig setupnow one cool aspect of multisigis that you canactually have a single sig walletuh so you can be using a hardware walletthat is single sig and then you cantake that single sig and you canactually also use it in a multi-sigenvironmentandit can be one signer of for instance thetwo of three in the multi-sig but alsoit could also be its separate walletum andi guess the main advantage thereumi guess there's two main advantagesthere first of all if someone findsyour single sigback up your your secret words uh itmight have some small amount of funds onit and they think that's all your fundsthey they can't tell that it's in amulti-sig setupumso they might just take that funds andthink they took all your bitcoin umthis thesecondary benefit isthat you know you can repurpose thesethese hardware wallets and use them formultiple wallets now one other caveathere is with multi-sig you do want toback up additional information besidesjust your seed wordsumbitcoin q a came in and then left againso i will continueumthe popular multi-sig softwaresparrowspectre supports it blue wallet supportsitthey will tell you what you need to backup and make sure you save all thatinformation now that informationthat additional information that's notyour seed words umthey will have terms like derivationpathum descriptorthe list of something called x pubs youdon't necessarily have to know what allof that means you just have to save itand you just have to realize thatwhileseed words area security risk if someone gets yourseed wordsthat information that separateinformation that you have to back upwith a multi-stick wallet is a privacyrisk so if someone finds that they cansee how much you're holding in themultisig but they can't necessarilyspend itbut you need that information plus yourbackup boards in order touh to spend your funds bitcoin q are youbacki am apologies for that that'll happen ithink it's my networkno worries at all um i just continued onand i just kept talking about multisigdo you be holding it downumii get i mean i think we arei i think i sufficiently explainedmultisig tradeoffs and and benefitsumshould we move on to mistakes commonmistakesyeah did you cover sort of thealternatives to doing it yourself themultitec approach no i didn't that'sgreat why don't you go into thatyeah so obviously matt's just outlinedsome of the potential pitfalls withdoing it yourself umso one of the other options is known askind of collaborative custodyalternatives where um there will be acentralized service uhsome examples are on chain capital anduh casaumwhere they will help you coordinate amultisit quorum and where they hold oneof the keysand so that in the event that you wereto umso i'll give you an example you'd have akey on your mobile phoneyou'd have a key on a hardware walletand one of theseservices will hold the key as wellso they only have one key so they can'tsteal from you which is greatumbut if you were to lose say your phonewhat their key or the key on yourhardware while and he didn't have itbacked up they will be able to step inas a third party to help you move yourbitcoin so that in a doomsday scenarioand you um you don't lose your lifesavings which is really greatyou will pay for this service and againi'm not sure on how much each charge thebottom tier i think is just over 100umlast time i checked per year and one ofthe the trade-offs with this is that umunless you sign up uh without yourpersonal information which i believe isquite difficult to do umthethese uh centralized um entities thathold the key and part of yourmulti-sitcorum they know who you arethey know how much bitcoin you hold inthat wallet because they hold one of thekeys and they alsohold the sort of uhthe wallet file if you like to put itsimply and so that they canjust as a kyc exchange can umbe able to tie you to your bitcoinidentity so it's worth paying up thetrade-offs yeah and you're using theirnode sothe assumption is if you do this if youuse one of these providersuh you're trusting them with yourprivacy but they will hold your hand andthey will have a spare key for you aswellum and they will help you onboard intothe process they will help you gethardware wallets they will go throughthat whole process but you are trustingthem with your privacy they know yourtransactions they know your balancesandin 99 of situations they know who youare as well uh they'll know the ipaddress of your of your devices that youconnect fromthis is all kind of getting a little bittoo much into the weeds but the key isthat you're trusting them with yourprivacyum i was explaining earlier justbasically doing it yourself so you coulduse your own note and you aren'ttrusting someone in that situation youcan still haveumother people hold keys for you so abitcoin q a started with a two of threesetup because that's a very common setupbut another common setup is a three offive setup and if you do a three of fivesetup you have five total keys and youneed three to spendsoif you need three to spendyou can hold three keys yourself so thatyou know you have and you put them indifferent locations and you know youhave enough to spend it yourself butthen you can also have you know a familymember a frienda lawyerholdhold a key you can have differentcombinations of people hold the key soit can be very useful inum[Music]specifically in in situations whereyou're trying like inheritancesituations where if if you pass away youhave large bitcoin savings uh you knowmaybe a lawyer is holding one in a trustmaybe a couple family members areholding individual ones and theybasically all need to collaboratetogether in order to spend your funds ifyou have three keys with other peopleum but you can also do it in a way whereyou don'tyou don't they never have the thresholdthey need to compromise you pluscombined togetheryeah i think umjust one final thing before we move onto the next topic um inheritance is abig one for me that um i i sort of liketo drive over people who seem to seemkeen to kind of jump into the diyapproaches thatyou know you might have spent some timelistening to some podcasts watching someuh tutorials or reading some guides andfeel comfortable in setting up amultisigumsetup um but what happens if you're notaround tomorrow unexpectedly uh is yourspouse your next kin are they going tobe able to coordinate a spend from a twoor three or a three or five do they knowwhere to find the keys do they know howto recover it and if you answer no toany of those questions then uh all ofyour life savings disappears when youdisappear soand something to bear in mind especiallyif you're going to take the diy approach100 i'd also add that there's a middleground hereuh specifically supported by cold cardcalled seed xor and basically in thatsituation instead of having one seedit's not multisig but instead of havingone seed you have two seeds and you needboth of them in order to spend yourfundsso it's a little bit different thanmulti-sig it can be more accessible topeople uh because you don't have theseadditionalcomplications that we were justdiscussing with multi-sigbut it gives you that benefit of nothaving a single seedbackup wordsthat can be compromised by someonethere's also something that's supportedby pretty much every wallet out therecalled a passphraseand in that situation you have thesebackup boards are usually 12 wordphrases or 24 word phrases thepassphrase is the 13th word or the 25thword and you pick that yourselfso if you do that method then you cankeep the passphrase separate from yourbackup words if someone wants tocompromise you they need access to bothumand i mean if it's a weak passphrasethey might just take your backup boardsand keep trying pass raisesumbut it it adds an additional umburden on them to try and compromise youwithout going through a multi-sig setupum anotherinteresting thing about passphrases isyou can store money on the bear backupwords and then you cannot when you use apasswords it's a separate wallet soin that situation you can actually keepfunds on youryour basic backup boardsand then if someone finds that they'lljust steal those that money and theymight not know you have a passphrasewith the majority of your savings in itum so that's just something to keep inmindawesome do you want to cover off uh somesome common mistakesnext on the listyeah i think common mistakes is a goodspot to go nextuh so i've got quite a lengthy list hereandthe first one of which unfortunately iuhfell fell prey to a little bit um andthat is uh it comes back to our veryfirst pointof cape kycmultiple exchanges and without any realneed to really um so i've just uh sortof expose myself to you know put my nameon loads of different databasesand soit's an unfortunate one that you can'treally undo like we spoke about beforeand if you were to you know listen tothis podcast and decide that youumstill want to gofor a kyc exchange because you think youknow the task of going uh no care adviceandtry and limit your umyour exposure to this by just signing upwith one reputable exchange umi think that's a good one to start anddid youi think that's very good advice like ifyou are going to use a kyc service whereyou're providing your identityinformation you should choose itcarefully you should choose someone youtrust the mostand you shouldnot sign up for a lot of people justsign up for a ton of different servicesyou should only you should sign up forthe bare minimum ideally if you're gonnado it you sign up for oneyou use it solely just to buy bitcoinand then send it to your own walletsumand and you don't you don't use anyother additional kyc services you wantto limit that as much as possiblesecond thing is did you change your micsetup at all because it's way worse nowthan it was beforeuhhello i changed my computer um i'll havea player how much while you're talkingnow turn up is it just quietno we can hear you but it's just likebreaking up a little bit it's likecutting in and outall right i'll let i'll play aroundumanother common mistakeuhthat i see people make isi i mean gambling on coins so a lotof people will think that um bitcoin istoo expensive and i've missed the boatand i i'm too late to bitcoin umliterally every single person who hasentered bitcoin at any time in bitcoinhistory has thought they were too latethere's like a famous screenshot ofsomeone on one of the bitcoin forums uhlamenting that they didn't get in atfive cents and instead they got in at adollar and they were too late and theymissed the busum so everyone feels that wayuh you're not alone in that it'simportant to realize that you cantransact insmaller units of account we call themsatssoyou can you don't have to have a fullbitcoin you don't you don't you don'tneed like right now bitcoins at almost70 thousand dollars you don't need toput 70 000 and to use bitcoin uh satsare the smallest unit of bitcoin there'sa hundred million of themper bitcoin andright now sats you can get 1500 for adollar so you can send any amount ofsats you want to send you can send twodollars worth you can send 25 centsworthumit doesn't matter don't get caught up inin in thinking that bitcoin is tooexpensiveuhwhat common thing that these other coinswill dois they make it so they have so manyunitsthat it seems like it's cheaper than itis just to try and get you in the doorit's a it's a marketing tactic so justkeep that in mind uh q are you thereyeah how's my mic now oh so much betteri'm glad i brought it up perfect okay doyou have more common mistakesuh yeah common one um is just notpracticing umenough with transacting uh testing mybackups for my hardware walletstesting different wallets even usingtest net just practice practice practiceand getting comfortable uh using the thevarious tools that we've spoken aboutandgetting comfortable with it either usingtestnet which is basically uha copy a carbon copy of bitcoin that'shas that holds no value you can get itfor free onwebsites called faucets where you can goon and just mimic the normal behavior ofa walletand without the fear oflosing any real value and so you cansend some test net bitcoin to to your hardware wallet and youcan wipe it recover itand just to get really reallycomfortable with with that process sothatif um the worst was happening and yousomething was to happen to your houseuh where you say bitcoin wherever youstore your coin andyou're when you're in that packed stateit's not like the first time you touchyour hardware wallet for five yearsbecause you you know you've done thatyou know people call practice so you'vegot this lots of time if you send realvalue in there but it'sconnected to you and because you know ifyou're in a panic and you you need tomove your bitcoin quickly the last thingyou might be doing is doing itin unfamiliar uhsituation or in a familiarsituation wherebecause that's when mistakes happen andyou could uh muck something upyeah so we see that happen a lot whereyou know peopleuh so i actually don'tespecially for newcomers i don't know ifyou need to use testnetum it adds just anothercomplication to your processumbut but what happens a lot is likepeople will buy bitcoin they'll send itto a hardware wallet they never reallyuh get comfortable with itthen bitcoin goes up in valuesignificantly and like four years laterthey're trying to spend it and they'rejust not comfortable at allso you really want to get comfortablewith it you want to practice sendingreceiving backing up and restoring umand just you know i don't think testthat's necessary in that situationbecause you should just do it with thesmall amounts you knowuse you know send five dollars back andforthuh erase the wallet restore it from yourbackup see that your five dollars arestill thereum one nice thing about my earlierapproach that i mentioned if having twoof the same hardware walletis without putting funds at risk at allyou can load up one hardware wallet withsome bitcoinand then you can restore iton your second hardware wallet you canload up those secret words onto thathardware wallet and if your funds arethere and you can spend them then youknow you did the backup and restoreprocess correctly without actuallywiping the original wallet so that'sanotherbenefit you're basically verifying yourbackup and restore processyou don't want to be in a situationwhere you have a lot of moneyandyou have a lot of money on the line andyou've never done a backup you've neverhave you've never done a restoredprocess and you're just freaking out andmaybe you wrote down the words wrongi've had that happen to friends wherewe've had to guess the word that theythey wrote down wrong or wrote down inbad handwriting um so you don't youdon't want to be in that situation youwant to practice practice practicei think just to add to that uh backupprocess as well is thatmost of the umor the hardware wallets that we'vetalked about this evening havemultiple different types of backups aswell so i think it's worth noting thatpractice using both of them as well sowe've got the the siege words umboth call card and passport alsoofferingbackups as well where you can store itbackup onto a micro sd card um which is alittle bit easier to store and so iwould urge people to practice restoringfrom both methods as well becauseat the end of the day if again if in adoomsday scenario you don't know whichmethod of backup you're actually goingto have access to or which is survivedwhatever um you know doomsday scenariohas actually happened100um before we move on to more commonmistakes we have alex mccluskey in thechat asking about 401k ira fundsum if you're trying to hold bitcoin in aa in a in a tax beneficial way in yourretirement accounti would just keep this very simple uh ifyou do haveuh a 401k or an ira where you alreadyhave funds in it and you want to movethem into bitcoinjust consider using uh the serviceoffered by unchained capital that'sunchained.com disclosure they are asponsor of ofmy other show rabbit will recap thisshow does not have sponsorsumbut they're a sponsor becausethey're a good team it's a good productumi have friends there that are workingthere my buddy jeff andrew runs theirtheir retirement division and they willhold your handthey will help you through it obviouslyas we said earlier the caveat is you'retrusting them with your privacyum but pretty much in all situationswith retirement funds if you're using atax beneficial retirement uh methodyou're going to have to trust someonebecause it's all getting reported to thegovernment as wellthe nice thing about what unchained doesis you hold your own keys so you getthat tax benefit um but you're holdingyour own keys they can't spend yourfundsa lot of the other programs that are outthereumcan can spend your funds at will and youhave to trust them completely with thesecurity of your funds and your privacyso just something to keep in mindyeah the next one umfrom me is kind of a little bit moreoutside of the box umi lurked around on on bitcoin twitterand in some of the communities uh for alot longer than i really should have umwhen i started to uh interact with withpeople in the you knowwallet chat rooms or the no chat roomsand to use a few examplesmy knowledge grew exponentially fromthen onwards from having thoseinteractions versus me just sitting onthe sidelines and kind of you knowliking a few tweets every now and thenso if i was to go back and kind of havemy time again i i'd absolutely startgetting involved and start contributingand to the conversation much muchearlier because uh personally speakinganywaymy my knowledge just uh you knowskyrocketed compared to where i was justa couple of years ago and so big one forme that oneyeah that's uhand uh i just i think like learn bydoing right practice with small amountsumand get your feet wet rather than feelintimidated and feel like you have toread everything and listen to everythingand watch everything uhbefore you even get your feet wetyeah another one as well is and and mattmight roll his eyes at this one is iskind of going publicumthere there's a lot of value in instaying in the proverbial shadow so tospeak um i would urge people you knownot touh sort of start shouting from therooftops uh that they own bitcoin againbecause you know we talked earlier aboutkyc and how we kind ofcan paint a sort of red cross on yourback a little bit well shout from therooftops um when bitcoin hits anall-time high to all your friendsand might uh inadvertently do the samething one day um you know yeah 100 alittle bit jealous you never know he'sgoing to get jealous andtell somebody else you tell somebodyelse who'san individual that might want to try andget their hands on it soum i would be be candid about who youwho you speak to bitcoin about and it'sa bita double-edged sword that one because uhi think we've all got a little bit of apersonal responsibility to try and helpon on board others as well so um alsosay just kind of be selective about whoyou speak to it and what you sayyeah it is um it might sound a littlehypocritical coming for meum as aas as a as a public bitcoin figureumbutdefinitely in the beginning you shouldnotyou should you should not be talking youshould try and reduce how much you talkabout bitcoin don't make it obvious thatyou own bitcoin don't post on socialmediauh consider using a name like bitcoin qa does i mean it might surprise you buthe wasn't born with that namehe decided on that name himself for theinternet for his bitcoin workumin the future if you do want to becomemore public about ituhyou can do so in a moreresponsible wayum rather than doing it right in thebeginning you can never come back fromit once you do itum so it's something to keep in mindyou should never talk about your ownbitcoin you should never talk about yourown how much bitcoin you haveumthese are best practices uh you don'tyou don't uheven if it's a friend or a family memberit might seem like small amount todaybut in the futureuh it could be a large amount and theywill not forget it they tend to rememberone of the first questions mostfriends and family will ask you is howmuch bitcoin you own they love askingthat questiondo not answer it explain why you don'twant to answer it for themumif people do know you own bitcointhis is where that multi-sig setupreally shines because you can have itgeographically distributed you can haveyour keys in different locations um thatare far away from each other that makeyou getting compromised more difficulteven in a physical attack situation andobviously it is more ideal to live in aplace where you haveum proper gun rights and you can defendyourselfumso these are things to considerum if i was to do it againi probably would not be uh you know aspublic as i am about bitcoin um i made ajudgment calllater on in my bitcoin journey that ifelt we needed more public bitcoinfigures that were talking about realissues and specifically privacy um so imade that judgment call but there aresome mornings that i wake up and regretitumbut there are precautions you can takeand there are benefits though to beingsemi-public about your bitcoin usage uhmeeting people i've met some of the bestpeopleyou know i have i have basically i havefamily now that wouldn't exist otherwiseum but these are all things that youshould considerum as part of your bitcoin journey butin the beginningvery very very stronglywould sayyou know keep keep it as discreet aspossibleum you never knowyou knowyou you don't want to expose yourself toa malicious actor your government couldturn on bitcoina foreign government can use thatinformation against you uh if you'retraveling across a border or somethinglike thatso you you want to keep this in mindyeah the final um sign off one for me umwould beuhi just completely got out of my brainuh what is another two fa is another onea good one to touch on i think um yeswould be um if if you and it's just comeback into me now so i've got two tofinish off um if you again listen tothis podcast decide that no kosc is notfor you and you want to sign up for anexchange and a lot of these exchangeswill prompt you to use uh sms-basedtwo-factor authentication to um i'musing air quotes here to secure youraccountum this is where you'll get a textmessage to when you try and log into theto the exchange they'll send you a textmessage to authorize that login um therehave been multiple umuhinstances where this has beenexploited people have had theirinformation and their accounts hacked onthese exchangeswhich if youunfortunately have got funds on thataccountcan be withdrawn to whoever's got accessto your account they can withdraw it totheir own walletanda better alternative and would be to usean app-based uhtwo-factor authentication so an examplewould be umthere's one called anduh there's one called a edgiest uhthere's another one called um help meout here matt i've drawn a blank umuh did you say agesyeah i said aegis yep aegis is myfavoriteany app-based one and far more secureand there's been far f well aegis isopen source aegis is open source uhthat's a e g i s and the backup processis very easy you got to remember whenyou when you use these authenticatorapps umif your phone dies you want to make sureyou have a backup of themso yeah the most popular one is googleauthenticator and it's notlast i mean i haven't used it inmaybe six years or something like thatbut previously it wasn't easy to back upso make sure you're using one that iseasy to back upand back it up and keep multiple copiesyeah or the other alternative is you canget umlike a physical device that acts as yourthe second factor authentication lookslike a bit of a usb key that providesthe the additional authorizationbut less services tend to umoffer compatibility with those100umi i would say i think for most peoplethe physical device is overkillum can a sophisticated attackercompromise a phone base two factoruh yesum have we seen any widespread cases ofthat no do they still need your emailand your password yes umon that note you shouldn't be using thesame emails and the same passwords indifferent placesum if you go to haveibinpone.com you canput your email address in and it'll tellyou wheneveruh database gets leaked with your emailor your password or your personalinformation um so that's a veryimportant resource but but what we see alot of times is like there'll be like aleaklike maybe facebook will get hacked andthose emails and passwords will then beused at all the other services to tryand get into your accountum so that two-factor code gives you anadditional protection on top of that butyou really shouldbe trying to limit reuse of emailaddresses and never reuse passwords umyeahuh yeah there's one in the chat scoobysnacks asking is a password manager agood idea yes definitely would recommendit to anybody my personal favorite isis bit warden again another free andopen source uh software they do offer apaid version as well but the thefreemium uhoption is perf is perfectly good enoughfor for uh 99 of users i would sayyeah bit warden's great um you justgottaif you're using a password managerum there's some nuance there because ifyou're not self-hosting your passwordmanager you're using awhat's the main onelastpass people love lastpassumit's closed source you're kind ofputting all your eggs in one basketuhso there's some concern there you knowif you if you have all your passwords inthis password manager and that passwordmanager gets compromised then all ofyour accounts are compromisedumwhat i think is like a veryuh easy accessible thing forumnew users or people that are concernedis is your really important passwordsyou can just write them in a notebookyou write them in a notebooksomeone's going to need to get access tothat notebook physically in order tocompromise youumyou might not want to write it outcompletely clear you know maybe somethings you remember versus some thingsare on the paperyou can develop your own like kind ofcode system don't over complicate ityou'll probably forget the passwordum[Music]but uhpaper and pen paper and pen is a triedand true methodyeah absolutely and then just don't putit on athe final one that went out my headbefore um waswe've spoken about uh you know there's alot of information the past couple ofhours umdon't try and uh do everything in thespace of a week especially if you areliterally at step one um i would sort ofpick one of these topics you know wespoke about them in aumin a specific order for a reason and iwould urge people to sort of start fromstep one and try and master each stepbefore they move to the net before theymove on or at least not try to do toomany of them at the same timedepending on the approach depending onthe the approach that you take for thedifferent tools that we've we've spokenuh you know to do it properly and to doit justice and to understand it andpractice it like we've been like we'vebeen sort ofreiterating it's gonna take you you knowum a good bit of time you're gonna haveto dedicate some time to do this and tomaster some of these tools so trying todo too much too soon is setting yourselfup to to fail so take your time uh beum deliberate about it and and sort ofmaster something then move onyeah and our i that's great advice andas bitcoin q a said our order in thisepisode was intentionalso don't feel like you have to gothrough all the steps at once butgo throughthat order was how we we we chose thatorder specifically because we think it'sa very um[Music]efficient effectiveuh managing trade-offs and stuff balanceof what order you should kind of becoming into this um we also have someperson in the chatum who uses the nim some person so everytime i call him out in the chat i soundlike i'm just don't care about his nameuh asking for the best a two-factor appfor ios i really like authenticator plusfor ios users um i think it's availableon android as well but if you're onandroid i really just like aegisumso yeah there you go for that answerum i have on this list bitcoin q a ihave common questions do you have commonquestions that you have in mind orum i've got nothing noted down but kindof umoff the top of my headum a common one that i get is sort of uhis umis this setup good for me or is thiswallet the one i should useuhyou know insert service or or tool hereyou know is this goodum it's the thing with bitcoin and andusing the tools properly that we've beenspeaking about is thatwhat matter i might recommend from ourown personal experiencesmight not be perfectly applicable toyour own personal uh throat metal threatmodels or skill set um soagain we we have kind of covered thisground a little bit earlier but is umjust try things out um you know by i'mnot saying don't come to the people imatter myself and ask for advice youknow we're always um more than happy toto to help out um but the best thing todo is to sort ofget your hands dirty and try these toolsyou know you can do it for for free orfor a very low fees at the moment andjust testing out wallets or or differentdevicesor multi-sig setups if you want to gothat far coinjoin implementationsumbest thing to do is get your hands dirtyget get amongst the communities and youknow what's perfect for one person mightnot be perfect for another so umit's a bit of adyor do your own research and getcomfortable with what's going to workfor you really100 um just to reiterate umbitcoin q a has all of his guides atbitcoiner.guideumi have a list of resources and tools atcivildispatch.comhelpat the top of civildispatch.com help ihave also i have links toboth bitcoin q aummyselfand our buddy katan from australia whoruns ministry of nodes offers uhwe offer private one-on-ones and there'slinks to all of that at the top ofcivildispatch.comhelpum so if you dofeel that you you have the need for aone-on-one a specific time to jump on acallum that is available to you as well ihighly recommend both bitcoin q aand and katan uh for that and that's whythey are at the top of that pageumi thinkuh narwhal tacos has an interestingpoint i i kind of touched on it but ifelt like it was a little bit too earlyin the episode so i didn't go heavy intoitumhe's asking have you explained that noone actually holds their sats in a wallat just the key it took me a while towrap my head around thatthat is absolutely correctum you're not actually storing yourbitcoin you're storing the key thatallows you to access and spend yourbitcoin um so when we talk about allthese wallets when we talk abouthardware wallets and mobile wallets it'sreally uh either piece of software apiece of hardware that is that isstoring that secret key for you andallowing you to easily access that soyou can access your bitcoin um i thinkthat's an important point but i i do iwould say thatthat's almost more of ai don't know i i feel like it's more ofan advanced thingfor all intents and purposes you cankind of operate under the assumptionthat you're holding your bitcoin in thewallet butum it is a good it is a good point thankyou narwhal tacos um i think with allthat said it doesn't seem like we haveuh any any additional questions in thelive chat i would add that obviouslythis is still dispatch 43 there's been42 other episodes filled with contentum well that's a lot more advanced thanthis so if you want to dive into thatafter listening to this obviously feelfree to do that it's all available forfree without ads or sponsorsum q a you have any any additionalthoughts here before we wrap upi just want to reiterate just getamongst the communities use the toolsget your hands dirty don't be afraid totry things out um come to myself or mattfor any help and advice and just oneother you know we've mentioned katan umone of the prominent educator in thespaces uh btc sessions got a fantasticyoutube page that's got guy video guideson using literally everything to do withbitcoin so um if you're more of a visuallearner uh check out his youtube channelit's a fantastic resource as well 100that is also linked at civildispatch.comhelp or you can just search btc sessionson youtubeum i made him a channel on bitcointv.comi don't think he has uploaded anythingtherebut there's also a ton of great contentat bitcointv.com that is curated one ofthe issues and the pitfalls you shouldkeep in mind when you're on youtubeumespecially the high view count videosare filled withscams and bad advice um so you need tobe very careful uh you know if you'rewatching a btc sessions video it mightrecommend another video that looks likeit's reputable and that a lot of peoplehave watched and recommended ityou need to be very carefuluhat the end of the day bitcoin's aboutpersonal responsibilityumso no one's gonna be there if you loseyour bitcoin there's no getting it backuh and there'sthere's a lot of money to be made givingbad advice and showing bad productso you really really need to beskeptical all the timethink for yourself make your owndecisions and constantly keep learningand i want to be very clear herethat i'm not asking you to trust meeitheror bitcoin q a or catan or anything elsewe've mentioned in this video in thisvideo or any of the other civil dispatchepisodesyou need to constantlyfigure out things for yourself and makeyour own judgment calls if anyone'sasking you to trust thembe very very careful and just be verycareful in generalumbtc pins wants everyone all thenewcomers to know that they could buythey could buy merch from him atbtcpins.com so there you go btc pins
