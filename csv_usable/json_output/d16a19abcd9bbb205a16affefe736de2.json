Sparrow provides huge amounts of detail to the user relating to their UTXO‚Äôs, transactions and balances, but does so in a very user friendly manner.\nFeatures\nSparrow Wallet comes with everything you‚Äôd expect from a desktop based wallet, and much more‚Ä¶\n\nOwn node backing (via Electrum server or Bitcoin Core)\nAbility to connect to pre selected public Electrum servers for those without their own node\nAbility to broadcast through Tor network using an external node\nWallet imports (including Electrum)\nAll major hardware wallet support (including air gapped devices)\nCoin selection and labelling\nMulti-Sig\nPSBT\nWatch only wallets\nCustom derivation paths\n\nDownload and verify Sparrow Wallet\n\nDownload Sparrow Wallet for your chosen operating system\nDownload the Manifest.txt + Manifest.asc files\n\n\n\n\n\nImport Craig Raw‚Äôs public key\n\ncurl https://keybase.io/craigraw/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen your downloads folder in the terminal and run gpg --verify sparrow-1.4.1-manifest.txt.asc\n\n\nLook for ‚ÄòGood signature from ‚ÄúCraig Raw craigraw@gmail.com‚Äù. This confirms the file came from the entity in control of Craig Raw‚Äôs private GPG key\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun sha256sum sparrow_1.4.1-1_amd64.deb\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen the Manifest.txt file you downloaded earlier and check that the hash provided matches the one shown in your terminal window. A match confirms the contents of the file you downloaded are an exact match to the one built by Craig when he signed these files\n\n\n\n\nIf you‚Äôre using Windows, there‚Äôs a guide for installation and verification of Sparrow here.\n\nInitial Set up\n\n\n\nSparrow Wallet offers users 3 ways to get started, each with their own pro‚Äôs and con‚Äôs.\n\n\n\nServer Type\nTrade-off\nPositives\n\n\n\n\nPre selected public Electrum Server\nNot your own hardware and shares wallet information with the entity running the server\nEasiest way to get started\n\n\nPrivate Bitcoin Core node\nWallet imports can take a while and uses Bitcoin Core which stores it‚Äôs wallets unencrypted\nNext easiest setup type (user can just download Bitcoin Core)\n\n\nPrivate Electrum Server\nBiggest barrier to entry\nMost private option + provides fastest wallet queries\n\n\n\n\nThe Public Electrum Server‚Äôs provided have been selected due to their record of respecting users privacy. However, running your own is always be the best option.\n\nAfter reading through the initial welcome screens, click ‚ÄòConfigure Server‚Äô. Sparrow will default to a public Electrum Server but for the purpose of the rest of this guide, we will be connecting to a private Electrum Server. Select that option from the menu at the top.\n\nEnter your Electrum Server onion address (or local IP address)\nSet the port to 50001\nToggle Use SSL off\nSpecify optional Tor proxy and port (if you don‚Äôt know what this means, leave these boxes blank)\n\n\n\n\n\nClick ‚ÄòTest Connection‚Äô. After a brief wait you will see a successful connection notification.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf connection is unsuccessful try changing the top right box to 50002 and toggling Use SSL to on.\n\nFor those with an Umbrel node, you can follow this guide by Athena Alpha that outlines how to connect Sparrow to your own Umbrel node using the Electrs app. They also have a guide showing how to connect Sparrow to Bitcoin Core as well.\nImporting your Coldcard\nThe following assumes that you have already initiated your Coldcard. If you have yet to do so, you can follow this guide.\n\nOn your Coldcard go to Advanced > Micro SD > Export Wallet > Generic JSON.\n\nThis will make a copy of your wallet onto your SD card that is readable by Sparrow Wallet. You can find more detail on this here. Once complete put the SD card into your computer.\n\nIn Sparrow, go to File> Import Wallet > Import File.\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose the coldcard-export.json on the SD card.\nSelect the script type and press Import.\n\n\nP2PKH = ‚ÄòLegacy‚Äô addresses starting with a 1\nP2SH-P2WPKH = ‚ÄòSegwit‚Äô compatibility addresses starting with a 3\nP2WPKH = ‚ÄòNative Segwit‚Äô addresses starting with BC1\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose a name for your wallet.\n\n\n\n\n\nGive your wallet an optional password. This password is specific to Sparrow and has nothing to do with the underlying seed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat‚Äôs it! You should now see your home screen with your Cold Card transactions and balances. (This is a brand new empty wallet shown below).\n\n\n\n\n\nReceive a transaction\n\nGo to the receive tab to view your first receive address. You can then share the address or QR code with whoever is sending you bitcoin.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should always verify the recieve address on your Coldcard.\n\n\n\n\n\nSending a transaction\n\nUsing these steps the wallet will choose which UTXO‚Äôs it spends for you.\n\n\nGo to the send tab\nPaste the address you are sending to\nEnter the amount and adjust your fee rate\nPress Create transaction\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next screen provides an incredibly detailed breakdown for the more advanced user to fine tune so more technical details where required.

This section assumes that you have already initiated these devices, if you have not already done so, follow these steps.\nHere is a brief run down of setting up a 2-of-3 quorum using Sparrow.\n\nClick File > New Wallet, give the wallet a name then click Create new wallet\nChange the Policy Type to Multi Signature\nChoose your cosigner setup (we are using 2-of-3 here)\n\n\n\n\n\nColdcard Import\n\nEnsure the SD card is inserted into the Coldcard then go to Settings > Multisig Wallets > Export XPUB\nThe Coldcard will save a file that looks like ccxp-8ff26349.json to the SD card\nPass the SD card back to your computer\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Sparrow ensure Keystore 1 is selected and press Air Gapped Hardware Wallet\nChoose Import File next to Coldcard Multisig\n\n\n\n\nCobo Vault Import\n\nOpen the menu with the button in the top left of the screen then press Multisig Wallet.\n\n\n\n\n\nTap the three dots in the top right corner then Show/Export XPUB. This will bring up a QR on screen.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Sparrow, select Keystore 2 > Air Gapped Hardware Wallet then Scan for the Cobo Vault Multisig option. This will open your computers camera, hold the device so that the QR code on the Cobo can be read\n\n\n\n\nSpecter DIY Import\n\nIn Specter DIY tap Master Public Keys > Multisig. The screen should then show a QR code\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Sparrow, select Keystore 3 > Air Gapped Hardware Wallet then Scan for the Specter DIY Multisig option. This will open your computers camera, hold the device so that the QR code on the Specter DIY can be read\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Apply then set an optional password to secure your wallet\n\n\nNotifying signers\nNow that the wallet is created, we need to notify each signer of the wallet creation.\nNotify Coldcard\n\nPress Export > Export File next to Coldcard Multisig\nInsert the Coldcard micro SD card into your computer and copy the generated .txt file onto it\nRemove the SD card and insert back into your Coldcard\n\n\n\n\n\nPower on your Coldcard and enter your PIN.

However it is sufficient to verify receive and change addresses on the other two signing devices.\n\nBackup\nMultisig backups are more complex than their single signature counterparts. You can read an in-depth look at this here.\n\nIn Sparrow click Export > Export File next to Sparrow\nIf your wallet is not password protected, this will create a .json file that you can back up onto as many SD cards as you like\nIf the wallet is password protected this will download a copy of your encrypted wallet file which you can open in Sparrow\n\n\nThis file is a ‚Äòview only‚Äô into your multisig wallet. To spend you still need m-of-n signers or seed backups\n\n\n\n\n\nVerify Receive Addresses\nYou will have already noticed that Sparrow shows you your first receive address. It is now important to verify that receive address on our trusted signing devices. Not all signing devices facilitate this, which is the reason both Coldcard and Cobo were included into this guide.\nSparrow\n\nClick into the receive tab and your first receive address will be shown\n\n\n\n\nColdcard\n\nPower on your Coldcard and enter your PIN. Press Address Explorer. scroll to the bottom and enter the number indicated to start\nScroll to the bottom of the next page and choose your recently imported multisig wallet\nYou will now have the option to save these to the SD card which could be useful if you plan on receiving often and wont have easy access to your devices\nScroll down, you will see the fingerprint of each signer, after that you should see a partially hidden version of your first receive address. Check it matches the one shown by Sparrow\n\n\n\n\nCobo Vault\n\nOpen the menu and press Multisig Wallet which will open the receive tab.
