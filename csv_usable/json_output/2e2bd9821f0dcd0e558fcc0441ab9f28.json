we bled him to death tryingto help himso when you're actually inflating themoney supply at seven percent but you'recalling it two percent because you wantto help the economyyou're literally bleedingthe the free market to deathbut the sad fact is george washingtonwent along with itbecause he thought that they were goingto do him goodandthe majority of of uh the society mostcompaniesmost most conventional thinkersyou knowthe working classthey go along with this because theythink that someone has their bestinterest in mind and the people that arebleeding them to deathbelievethey they believe that prescriptionbecause their mental models are just sodefectivethe following is a conversation withmichael saylor one of the most prominentand brilliant bitcoin proponents in theworldhe is the ceo of microstrategyfounder of sailor academy graduate ofmitand michael is one of the mostfascinating and rigorous thinkers i'veever gotten a chance to explore ideaswith he can effortlessly zoom out to thebig perspectives of human civilizationin human history and zoom back in to thetechnical details of blockchains marketsgovernments and financial systemsthis is the lex friedman podcast tosupport it please check out our sponsorsin the description and now dear friendshere's michaelsaylorlet's start with a big question of truthand wisdomwhen advanced humans or aliens or aisystems let's say five to ten centuriesfrom now look back at earthon this early 21st centuryhow much do you think they would say weunderstood aboutmoney and economics or even aboutengineering science life death meaningintelligence consciousness all the biginteresting questionsi think they would uhprobably give us ab minus on engineering on all theengineering things the hard sciences thepassing gradelike we're doing okay we're working ourway through rockets and jets andelectric cars and uhelectricity transport systems andnuclear power and space flightand the likeand you know if you if you look at thewallsthat uh grace the great court at mitit's full of all the great thinkers andand they're all pretty admirable youknow if you could be with newton orgauss ormadame curie oreinsteinyou know you would respect themi would say they'd give us like aa d minus on economicslikeyou know an f plus or a d minus you youhave an optimistic vision first of alloptimistic vision of engineeringbecause everybody you've listednot everybody most people you've listedis just over the past couple ofcenturiesand maybe it stretches a little fartherback but mostlyall the cool stuff we've done inengineering is the past couple centuriesi mean archimedesyou know had his virtuesyou know i studied the history ofscience at mit and i also studiedaerospace engineering and and so iclearly have a bias in favor of scienceand if i look at the past 10 000 yearsand i considerall of the philosophy and the politicsand their impact on the human conditioni think it's a wash for every politicianthat came up with a good idea anotherpolitician came up with a bad idea yeahright and it's not clear to me that youknow most of the political andphilosophical you knowcontributions to the to the human raceand the human conditions have advancedso much i mean we're still takingyou know taking guidance and admiringaristotle and plato and seneca and thelikeand on the other handyou know if you think about uh what hasmade the human condition betterfirewater harnessing of wind energy like tryto row across an oceanright not easy and for people who arejust listening or watching there's abeautiful sexy ship from16century this is a 19th century handmademodel of a 17th centurysailing ship which is of the type thatthe dutch east india's company used tosail the world and trade so that wasmade you know the original was madesometime in the 1600s and then thismodel is made in the 19thcentury by individuals both the modeland the ship itself is engineering atits best and just imagine just likeraucous flying out to space how muchhope this filled people with exploringthe unknown going into the mysteryuhboth the entrepreneurs and the businesspeople and the engineers and just humanswhat's out there what's out there to bediscovered yeah the metaphor of humanbeings leaving shore or sailing acrossthe horizon risking their lives inpursuit of a better life is anincredibly powerful onein1900 i suppose the average lifeexpectancy is 50.during the revolutionary war you knowwhile our founding fathers were fightingto establish you know life libertypursuit of happiness the constitutionaverage life expectancy of it's like 32.some between 32 and 36.so all the sound in the fury doesn'tmake you live past 32 but what doesright antibioticsconquest of infectious diseases if weunderstand the science ofof infectious disease they're you knowsterilizinga knifeand harnessing antibiotics gets you from50 to 70 and that happened fast rightthat happens from 1900 to 1950 orsomething like thatand i i think if you looklook at the human conditionyou ever get on one of those rowingmachines where they actually keep trackof your watts output when you're on thatyeah you know it's like 200 is a lotokay 200is a lot so a kilowatt houris like all the energy that a human atrained athlete can deliver ina dayand probably not one percent of thepeople in the in the world could delivera kilowatt hour in a day and thecommercial value of a kilowatt hour theretail value is 11 cents today and uhthe wholesale value is two centsandso you have to look at the contributionof politicians and philosophers andeconomists to the human conditionand and it's it's like at best to washone way or the other and then if youlook at the contribution of john drockefellerwhen he delivered you a barrel of oilyeah and then you know the energy and inoil liquid energy or the contribution ofteslayou know as we deliver electricityyou knowand what's the impact of the humancondition if i haveelectric powerif i have chemical power if i have windenergyif i if i can actually set up areservoir create a dam spin a turbineand generate energy from a hydraulicsourcethat's extraordinaryright and and so our ability to crossthe oceanour ability to grow food our ability toliveit's it's technology that gets the humanrace fromyou knowa brutal life where life expectancy is30toa world where life expectancy is 80.you gave a d minus the economist so arethey two like the politicians awashin terms of there's good ideas and badideas and and that tiny delta betweengood andand bad is how you squeak past the fplus onto the d minus territoryi think most economic ideas are badideas like mostyou know like umtake us back to mit and you want tosolve uh a fluid dynamics problem likelike design the shape of the whole ofthat shipor you want to design an airfoil a wingor if you want to designan engine or aa nozzle and a rocket shipyou wouldn't do it with simplearithmeticyou wouldn't do it with a scalar there'snot a single number right is vector it'svector math you know computational fluiddynamics is n dimensionalhigher level math you know complicatedstuffso when when an economist says theinflation rate is two percent that's ascalar and when an economist saysit's not a problem to print more moneybecause the velocity of the money isvery low the monetary velocity is lowthat's another scalarokay sothe truth of the matter isinflation is not a scalar inflation isan in-dimensional vectormoney velocity is not a scalarumdevelo saying what's the velocity ofmoney oh oh it's slow or it's fastit ignores the question ofwhat medium is the money moving throughin the same way that you knowwhat's the speed of soundokay well what is sound rightsound you know sound is uh is acompression wave it's energy uh movingthrough a medium but the speed isdifferentso for example the speed of soundthrough air is different than the speedof sound through waterand and a sound moves faster throughwater it moves faster through a solidand it moves faster to a stiffer solidso there isn't onewhat is the fundamental problem with theway economists reduce the world down toa model is it too simpleor is it just even the first principlesof constructing the model is wrong ithink that uh the fundamental problem isif you see the world as a scalar yousimply pickthe one number which iswhich supports whatever you want to doand you ignorethe universe of otherconsequences from your behaviorin general i don't know if you've heardoflike eric watson has been talking aboutthis with gage theory so differentdifferent kinds of approachesfrom the physics world from themathematical world toextend past thisscalar view of economics so gauge theoryis one way that comes from physicsdo you find thata way of exploring economics interestingso outside of cryptocurrency outside ofthe actual technologies and so on justanalysis of how economics works do youfind that interestingyeah i i think that if we're going towant to really make any scientificprogress in economics we have to applymuchmuch more computationally intensive andricher forms of mathematicsso simulation perhaps oryeah you know when i was at mit istudied system dynamicsyou know they taught it at the sloanschool it was developed by jay forresterwhowho whowas an extraordinary computer scientistandwhen we've created modelsofeconomic behavior they were allmulti-dimensional non-linear models soif you want to describe howanything works in the real world youhave to start with the concept offeedbackif i double the price of somethingdemand will fall and attempts toto create supply will increase and therewill be a delaybefore the capacity increases there'llbe an instant demandchange and there'll be rippling effectsthroughout every other segment of theeconomy downstream and upstream of suchthingso it's kind of common sensebut most economics most classicaleconomics it's alwaysyou know taught with linear modelsyou know fairly simplistic linear modelsand oftentimes even i'm really shockedtodaythat the entiremainstream dialogue of economics hasbeen captured byscalar arithmeticfor exampleif if you readyou know read any article in new yorktimes or the wall street journal rightthey just refer to there's an inflationnumber or the the cpi orthe inflation rate is xand if you look at all the historicstudiesof the impact of inflationgenerally they're all based uponthe idea that inflation equals cpi andthen they try to extrapolate from thatand you just get nowhere with itsoat the very least we should beconsidering inflation and othereconomics concept as a non-lineardynamical system so non-linearity andalso just embracing the full complexityof just how the variables interact maybethrough simulation maybe some have someinteresting models around that wouldn'tit be refreshing if somebody for oncepublished a table of the change in priceof every product every service and everyasset in every placeover timeyou said table some of that also is thetask of visualizationhow to extract from this complex set ofnumberspatterns thatuh somehow indicate somethingfundamental about what's happening solike each summarization of data is stillimportant perhaps summarization not downto a single scalar value but looking atthat whole sea of numbers you have tofindpatterns like what is inflation in aparticular sector what is maybe uhchange over time maybe differentgeographical regionsyou knowthings of that nature i think that'skind of i don't know even what that taskis uh you know that's what you couldlook at machine learning you can look atai with that perspective which is likehow do you representwhat's happening efficientlyas efficiently as possible that's nevergoing to be a single number but it mightbe a compressed model that capturessomethingsomething beautiful somethingfundamental about what's happeningit's an opportunityfor sureright umyou knowif we take um for example during thepandemicthethe response of the political apparatuswas to lower interest rates to zeroand to start tostart buying assets in essence printingmoneyand the defense was there's no inflationyeahbut of course you had one part of theeconomy where it was locked down so itwas illegal to buy anythingbut you couldn't you know it was eitherillegal or it was impracticalso it would be impossible for demand tomanifest so of course there is noinflationon the other handthere was instantaneous immediateinflation in another part of the economyfor example umyou lowered the interest rates uh tozero one point we saw the uh the swaprate on the 30-year note go to 72 basispointsokay that means that the value of a longdated bond immediately inflates so thebond market had hyper inflation withinminutesof thesefinancial decisions the asset market hadhyperinflationwe hadwhat you call a case shape recovery whatwe affectionately call a shake k shaperecovery main street shutdownwall street recovered all within sixweeksthe inflation was in the assetslike in the stocks in the bonds uhyou know if you look today you see thatatypical house according to case-shillerindex today is up 19.2 percentyear-over-yearsoif you're a first-time home buyer theinflation rate is 19 percentuh the formal cpi announced a 7.9percentyou can pretty muchcreate any inflation rate you want byconstructing a market basket a weightedbasket of products or services or assetsthat yield you the answeri think thatyou know the fundamental failing ofeconomist is is first of allthey don't really have a term for assetinflationright what's an asset what's assethyperinflation you mentioned bond marketswap rate and asset is where the allmajority of the hyperinflation happenedwhat's inflation what's hyperinflationwhat's an asset what's an asset marketi'm going to ask so many dumb questionsin the conventional economic world youwould you would treat inflation as uhthe rate of increase in price of amarket basket of consumer productsdefined by a government agencyso they have a like traditional thingsthat a regular consumer would be buyingthe government selects like toilet paperfoodtoasterrefrigerator electronics all that kindof stuff and it's like a representativea basket of goodsthat lead to a content existence on thisearth for a regular consumer they definea synthetic metric right i mean i i'mgoing to say you should have a thousandsquare foot apartment and you shouldhavea used car and you should eat you knowthree hamburgers a weeknow ten years go by and the apartmentcosts morei could adjust the market basketby a you know they call them hedonicadjustments i could decide that it usedto be in 1970 to a thousand square feetbut in the year 2020 you only need 700square feet because we've manyminiaturized televisionsand we've got more efficient electricappliances and because things havecollapsed into the iphone you just don'tneed as much spaceso now i you know it may be that theapartment costs 50 percent more butafter the hedonic adjustment there is noinflation because i just downgraded theexpectation of what a normal personshould have so the synthetic nature ofthe metric allows for manipulationby people in powerpretty muchi guess my criticism of economist israther than embracing inflationbased upon its fundamental idea which isthe rate at which the price of things gouprightthey've been capturedby amainstream conventional thinking toimmediately equate inflation tothe government issued cpi orgovernment-issued pce orgovernment-issued ppi measure whichwas never the rate at which things go upit's simply the rate at which asynthetic basket ofproducts and services the governmentwishes to track go upnow the problem with thatis istwo big things one thing is thegovernment gets to create the marketbasket and so they keep changing what'sin the basketover timeso i mean ifif i keep tr if i said three years agoyou should go see ten concerts a yearand the concert tickets now cost twohundred dollars each now it's twothousand dollars a year to go seeconcertsnow i'm in charge of calculatinginflation so i redefine you know yourentertainment quota for the year to beeight netflix streaming concerts and nowthey don't cost two thousand dollarsthey cost nothing and there is noinflation but you don't get yourconcerts right so the problem startswithcontinually changing the definition ofthe market basket but in my opinionthat's not the biggest problemthe morethe more egregious problemis the the fundamental idea that assetsaren't products or servicesassets can't be inflated with an asset ahousea share of apple stockum a bondum any a bitcoin is an asset um or uh apicasso painting sonot a consumable goodnot a uh not not an apple that you caneatright if i throw away an assetthen uh i'm not on the hook to track theinflation rate for it sowhat happens if i change the policy suchthatlet's take the class example a milliondollar bond at a five percent interestrate gives you fifty thousand dollars ayear in risk-free incomeyou might retire on fifty thousanddollars a year in a low-costjurisdictionso the cost of social security or earlyretirement is one million dollars whenthe interest rate is five percentuh during the the crisis of march of2020 the interest rate went on a 10-yearbond went to 50 basis pointsokay so now the cost of that bond is 10million dollarsokay the cost of social security wentfrom a million dollars to 10 milliondollarsso if you wanted to work your entirelife save money and then retirerisk-free and live happily ever after ona 50 000 salary living on a beach inmexico wherever you wanted to goyou had hyperinflation the cost of youraspiration increased by a factor of 10over the course ofyou know some amount of time in factin that case that was like over thecourse of about 12 yearsright as the inflation rate ground downthe asset traded upbut the you know the conventional viewis oh that's not a problem because it'sgood that that assets it's good that thebond is highly priced because we own thebondor umwhat's the problem with the inflationrate in housing being 19it's an awful problem for a 22 year oldthat's starting their first job that'ssaving money to buy a housebut it would be characterized as abenefit to society by a conventionaleconomist who would say wellhousingasset values are higher because ofinterest rate fluctuation and now theeconomy's got more wealthand uh and so that's that's viewed as abenefitso the what's being missed herelike the suffering of the average personor theuh the struggle the suffering the painof the average personlike metrics that captured that withinthe economic system is that is it whenyou talk about one way to say it is aconventionalview of inflation as cpi understates thehuman misery that's in inflicted uponthe working classand and on uh mainstream companiesuhby uhby the political class and so it's amassive shift of wealth from the workingclass to the property classit's a massive shift of power from thefree market uh to the centrally governedor the controlled marketit's a massive shift of power from thepeople to the government and andmaybe one one more illustrative pointhere alexisis uh what do you think the inflationrate's been for the past 100 yearsoh you talking about the scalar again ifyou if you took a survey of everybody onthe street and you asked them what dothey think inflation was uh what is ityou knowremember when jerome powell said ourtarget's two percent but we're not thereif you goaround the corner i have uh posted thedeed to this house sold in 1930.okay and uhthe number on that deed is one hundredthousand dollars1930. and if you go on zillowand you get the z estimate is it higherthan that no 30 million 500 000yeahsothat's uh 92 years 1930 or2022andand in 92 years we've had 305x increase in price of the housenow if you actually back calculate youcan you come to a conclusion that theinflation rate was approximately six anda half percent a yearevery yearfor 92 yearsokay and and there's nobodynobody in government no conventionaleconomist that would ever admit to aninflation rate of seven percent a yearin the us dollar over the last centurynowif you if you uh dig deeper i mean oneone guy that's done a great job workingon this is seifidin amus who wrote whowrote the book the bitcoin standard andhe notes that on average it looks likethe inflation rate and the money supplyis about seven percent a year all theway up to the year 2020if you look at the s p index which is amarket basket of scarce desirable stocksit returned about 10 percentif you talk to 10 a year for 100 yearsthe money supply is expanding at 7 100yearsif you actually talk to economists oryou look at the the economy and you askthe question how fast does the economygrowin its entirety year over yeargenerally about two to three percentlike the sum total impact of all thistechnology and human ingenuitymight get you a two and a half threepercent improvement a year as measuredby gdpis that are you okay with that not surei'm not sure i'd go that far yet but iwould just say thatif you had the human race doing stuffyeah and if you ask the question howmuch more efficiently will we do thestuff next year than this year or howwhat's the value of all of ourinnovations and inventions andinvestments in the past 12 monthsyou'd be hard-pressed to say we get twopercent bettertypical investor thinks they they're 10better every yearso if you look at what's going on reallywhen you're holding a million dollars ofstocks and you're getting a 10 gain ayear you really get a seven percentexpansion of the money supplyyou're getting a two or three percentgain under best circumstancesandanother way to say that isif the money supply stopped expanding atseven percent a year the s p yield mightbe three percent and not ten percent itprobably should benow that that gets you to start to ask abunch of other fundamental questionslike if i borrow a billion dollars andpay three percent interest and the moneysupply expands at seven to ten percent ayear andi ended up making a ten percent returnon a you know billion dollar investmentpaying three percent interest is thatfairand who who sufferedso that i could do that becausein an environment where you're justinflating the money supply and you'reholding the assets constantit stands the reason that the price ofall the assets is going to appreciatesomewhat proportional to the moneysupplyand the difference in assetappreciations is going to be a functionof the scarce desirable quality of theassets and to what extent can i makemore of them and to what extent are theyare they truly limited in supplyyeah so we'll we'll get to a lot of thewords you said there the scarcityuh and it's so good connected to howlimited they are and the value of thoseassets but you also said so theexpansion of the money supply you justput another way is printing money and sois is that always bad the expansion ofthe money supply is this just uh to putsome terms on the table so we understandthemumyou nonchalantly say it's alwaysthe on average expanding every year themoney supply is expanding every year byseven percent that's a bad thing that'sa universally bad thingit's awfulwell i guess i guess to be preciseuh it's the currencythat i meanmy money uh i would say money ismonetary energy or economic energyand the economic energy has to find itsway into a medium so if you want to moveit rapidly as a medium of exchange hasto find its way into currency but themoney can also flow into property like ahouse or goldif the money flows into propertyit'll probablyhold its value much better if the moneyflows into currency right if you had puta hundred thousand dollars in this houseyou would have 305 x return over 92years but if you had put the money ahundred thousand dollars in a safedeposit box and buried it in thebasementyou would have lost 99.7percent of your wealth over the sametime periodso um so the the expansion of thecurrencycreates uh creates a massiveinefficiency in the society what i'llcall an adiabatic lapseit'swhat we're doing is we're bleedingthe civilization to death right theantibiotic adiabatic what's that wordthat'sadiabatic adiabaticright and aerospace engineering you wantto solve any problem they they startwith the phrase assume an adiabaticsystem and what that means is a closedsystem okay so i've got it i've got acontainer and in that container no airleaves and no air enters no energy exitsor enters so it's a closed systemso you got the closed system lapseokayokay i'm going to use a there's a leakin the ship i'm going to use a physicalmetaphor for you because you're thejujitsu right like like you got 10 pintsof blood in your bodyand so before your nextworkout i'm going to take one pint fromyounow you're going to go exercise butyou're one point you've lost 10 percentof your bloodokayyou're not going to perform as well ittakes about one month for your body toreplace the red blood platelets so whatif i tell you every month you got toshow up and i'm going to bleed youyeah okay so uh so if i'm draining theenergy i'm drink i'm draining the bloodfrom your body you can't performif you adiabatic lapse is when you go upin altitude every thousand feet you losethree degreesyou go 50 000 feet you're 150 degreescolder than sea level that's why you youknow you look at yourinstruments and instead of 80 degreesyour minus 70 degreeswhy is the temperature fallingtemperatures falling because it's not aclosed system it's an open system as theair expands the density fallsright the enerthe energyperuhper cubic whatever you know falls andtherefore the temperature falls rightthe heat's falling out of the solutionsowhen you're inflating let's say you'reinflating the money so the currencysupply by six percent you're sucking sixpercent of the energyout of the fluid that the economy isusing to function so the currency thiskind of ocean of currency that's a niceway for the economy to function it's themost kind of uhit's being inefficient when you expandthe money supply but it's uhthat look it's the liquid i'm trying tofind the right kind of adjective hereit's how you do transactions at a scaleof billionscurrency is the asset we use uh to movemonetary energy around and you could usethe dollar or you could use the peso oryou could use the bolivar selling housesand buying houses is much moreinefficientor likeyou can'ttransact between billions of people withhouses yeah properties don't make suchgood mediums of exchange they makebetter stores of value and they theyhave utility value if it's a if it's aship or a house or or a plane or abushel of cornrightcan i zoom out just for yeah can we zoomout keep zooming out until we reach theorigin of human civilization but on thewayaskyou gave economists a d-minusi'm not even going to ask you what yougive to governmentsuhdo you think their failure economist andgovernment failure is malevolence orincompetencei think uhpolicymakers are well-intentioned butgenerally all all government policy isinflationary and all government it'sinflammatory and inflationary so what imean by that isyou know when you have a policy uhpursuinguhsupply chain independence if you have anenergy policy if you have a labor policyif you have a trade policy if you have ayou know any any kind of foreign policya domestic policya manufacturing policy every one ofthese medical policyevery one of these policiesinterferes with the free market and andgenerally prevents some rational actorfrom doing it in a cheaper moreefficient wayso when you layer themon top of each other they all have to bepaid forif you want to shut down the entireeconomy for a year you have to pay forit right if you want to fight a war youhave to pay for itright if you don't want to use oil ornatural gas you have to pay for it ifyou don't want to manufacturesemiconductors in china and you want tomanufacture them in the u.s you got topay for it if i rebuild the entiresupply chain in pennsylvania and i hirea bunch of employees and then i unionizethe employeesthen not only am ii idle the factory in the far east itgoes to 50 capacity so so whatever itsells it has to raise the price on andthen i drive up the cost of labor forevery other manufacturer in the usbecause i competing against themright i'm changing their conditions soeverything gets less efficienteverything gets more expensive and ofcourse the government couldn't reallypay foruh its policies and its wars with taxeswe didn't pay for world war one with taxwe didn't pay for world war ii with taxwe didn't pay for vietnam with tax infact you know when you trace this whatyou realize is the government never paysfor all of its policies with taxesto ask to raise the taxes to trulytransparently pay for the things you'redoing with taxes with taxpayer moneybecause they feel that's oneinterpretation or it's just tootransparent like if people if peopleunderstood the the the true cost of warthey wouldn't want to go to war if youwere told that you would lose 95 of yourassets you know and 90 of everything youwill be ever will be taken from youyou mightreprioritize your thought about a givenpolicy and you might not vote for thatpolitician but you're still sayingincompetence not malevolenceso fundamentally government creates abureaucracy of incompetence is kind ofhow you look at iti think a lack of humility rightlike uh likeif if people had more humility then theywould realizehumility about how little they knowhow little they understand about thefunction of complexity this is thephrase from queen eastwood's movieunforgiven where he says a man's got toknow his limitations[Laughter]i i think that a lot of peopleoverestimatewhat they can accomplish and experienceexperience in life causes youto uhto reevaluate that so i mean i've done alot of things in my life and andgenerallymy mistakes were always my good ideasthat i enthusiastically pursuedto the detriment of mygreat ideas that required150 of my attentionto prosper so i think people pursue toomany good ideas and you know they allsound goodbut there's just a limit to to what youcan accomplishand everybody underestimates thechallengesof of implementing an idearight and uh and they alwaysoverestimate the benefitsof the pursuit of that so i think it'san overconfidence that causes an overexuberance and pursuit of policies andas the ambition of the governmentexpands so must the currency supplyyou know i could say the money survivallet's say the currency supplyumyou can triple the number of pesos inthe economybut it doesn't triple uh the amount ofmanufacturing capacity in the saideconomyand it doesn't triple the amount ofassets in the economy it just triplesthe pesos so as youincrease the currency supplythen the price of all those scarcedesirable things will tend to go uprapidlyand the confidenceofall of the institutions the corporationsand the individual actorsand trading partners will will collapseif we take a tangent on a tangent and wewillreturn soon to the uh the big humancivilization questionuhso if governmentnaturally wants to buy stuff it can'taffordwhat's the best form of governmentuh anarchismlibertarianism so not even go there'snot even armies there's noborders that's anarchism the leastthe smallest possiblethe smallest possible the last the bestgovernment would be the least and thedebate will be overthat when you think about the stuffdo you think about okay government isthe way it is ias a person that can generate greatideas how do i operate in this world ordo you also think about the big pictureif we start a newcivilization somewhere on mars do youthink about what's the ultimate form ofgovernmentwhat's uh at least a promising thing totryyou know umi have laser eyes on my profile ontwitterwhat does that mean and the significanceof laser eyes is to focus on the thingthat can make a difference yes and umif i look at the civilizationum i would sayhalf the problems in the civilizationare due to the fact that ourunderstanding of economics and money isdefectivehalf50i don't know it's worth 500 trilliondollars worth of problems likemoney uh money represents all theeconomic energy and the civilization andit kind of equates to all the productsall the services and all the assets thatwe have and we're ever gonna have sothat's halfthe other half of the problems in thecivilization are medicalandand military and politicaland philosophicaland you knowand uhand i think that there are a lot ofdifferent solutionsto all those problems and they're allthey are all uhhonorable professions andand they all merit a lifetime ofconsideration for the specialist in allthose areasi i think thatwhat i could offer it's constructive isinflation is completely misunderstoodit's a much bigger problemthan we understand it to bewe need to introduce engineering andscience techniques into economics if wewant to further the human conditionall government policy is inflationaryyou know and another pernicious mythis uh inflation is alwaysand everywhere a monetary phenomena soyou know a famous quote by miltonfriedman i believe it's like it's amonetary phenomena that is inflationcomes from expanding the currency supplyit's a nice phraseand it's oftentimes quoted by peoplethat are anti-inflationbut again it it just signifies a lack ofappreciation of what the issue isinflation is if i if i had a currencywhich was completelynon-inflationary if if i never printedanother dollarand if i eliminated fractional reservebanking from the face of the earthwe'd still have inflation and we'd haveinflation as long as we have governmentthat that is capable of pursuingany kind of policies that are in the inthemselves inflationary and generallythey all are so in generalinflationary is the bigcharacteristic of human nature thatgovernments collection of groups thathave power over others and allocateother people's resourceswilltry tointentionally or not hide the costs ofthoseallocations like in some tricky wayswhatever the options ever availableyou know hiding the cost is like is likethethe tertiary thing likethe the primary goal is the governmentwill attempt to do goodright and that's the fundament that'sthe primary problem they will attempt todo good and they will and they will doit and they will do good and imperfectlyand they will createoftentimes uh as much damagemore damage than the good they do mostgovernment policy will be iatrogenic itwill it will create more harm than goodin the pursuit of it but it is what itis the secondaryuh the secondary issue is they willunintentionally pay for it by expandingthe currency supply without realizingthat they're uhthey're actually paying for it inin a sub-optimal fashion they'llcollapse their own currencies while theyattempt to do good the the tertiaryissue is they will mismeasurehow badly they're collapsing thecurrencyso for example if you go to the bureauof labor statistics you know and look atthe numbers printed by the fed they'llsay oh it looks like the dollar has lost95 of its purchasing power over 100years okay they sort of fess up there'sa problem but they make it 95 percentloss over 100 years what they don't doisrealize it's a 99.7loss over 80 years so they willmismeasure just the horrific extentof uh the monetary policy in pursuit ofthe foreign policy and the domesticpolicy which theythey theyoverestimate their budgetand their means to accomplish their endsand they underestimate the costand and they're oblivious to thehorrificdamage that they do to the civilizationbecausethe mental models that they use that areconventionally taughtare wrong right the mental model thatlike it's okay we can print all thismoney because the velocity of the moneyis low right because money velocity is ascalar and inflation is the scalar andwe don't see two percent inflation yetand the money velocity is low and soit's okay if we printtrillions of dollars wellthe money velocity was immediateright the velocity of money through thecrypto economyis 10 000 times fasterthan the velocity of money through theconsumer economyright it's like i think nick pointed outwhen you spoke to him he said it takestwo months for a credit card transactionto settleright so you want to spend a milliondollars in the consumer economy you canmove it six times a yearyou you put a million dollars into goldgold will sit in a vault for a decadeokay so the velocity of money throughgold is 0.1you put the money in the stock marketand you can trade it once a week thesettlement is t plus 2 maybe you get totwo to one leverage you might get to amoney velocity of a hundred a yearin the stock marketyou put your money into the cryptoeconomy and these people are settlingevery four hoursand and you know if you're offshorethey're trading with 20x leverageso if you if you settle every dayand you trade the 20x leverage you justwent to 7 000.yeah so the la the velocity of the moneyvaries i think the politicians they theydon't really understand inflation andthey don't understand economics but butyou can't blame thembecause the economists don't understandeconomics because the because if theydidthey would be creatingmulti-variate computer simulations wherethey actually put inthe priceof every piece of housing in every cityin the world the full array of foods andthe full array of products and the fullarray of assetsand thenon a monthly basis they would publishall those results and where and that's ahigh bandwidthrequirementand i i think that people don't reallywant to embrace itand and also there's the most perniciousthingthere's that phraseyou knowyou can'ttell people what to think but you cantell them what to think about the mostpernicious thingis is i get you to misunderstandthe phenomenaso that even when it's happening to youyou don't appreciate that it's a badthing and you think it's a good thing soif housing prices are going up 20percent year over year and i say this isgreat for the american public becausemost most of them are home ownersthen i have i've misrepresented aphenomena inflation is 20not 7 percent and then i'vemisrepresented it as being a positiverather than a negativeand people will stare at it and youcould even show them their house on fireand they would perceive it as beinggreat because it's warming them up andthey're going to save on their heatcosts it does seem that the cruder themodel whether it's economics whetherit's psychologythe easier it is to weave whatever theheck narrative you wantand not in a malicious way but just likeit's it's some some kind of like uhemergent phenomena this narrative thingthat we tell ourselves so you can tellany kind of story about inflationinflation is good inflation is bad likethe cruder the model the easier it is totell a narrative about it and that'swhat the so like if you take anengineering approachit's i feel like it becomes more andmore difficultto run away from sort of a true deepunderstandingof the dynamics of the systemi mean honestly if you went to 100people on the street you asked them todefine inflation how many would how manywould sayit's a vector tracking the change inpriceof every product service asset in theworld over timeno not menoif you if you went to them and you saidyou know do you think two percentinflation a year is good or badthe majority would probably say wellhere it's good you know the majority ofeconomists would saytwo percent inflation a year is goodand of course there'slook at the ship next to us what if itold youthatthe ship leakedtwo percent rightof its volume every something right theship is rotting two percent a year thatmeans the useful life of the ship is 50years now ironically that's true like awooden ship had a 50year to 100 year life 100b long 50 yearsnot unlikely so when we built ships outof woodthey had a useful life of about 50 yearsand then they sunk they rotted there'snothing good about it right you build aship out of steelyou know and it's zero as opposed to twopercent degradationand how much better is zero percentversus two percentwelltwo percent means you have a useful lifeofyou knowit's half-life of 35 years2 2 is a half-life of 35 years that'sbasically the half-life of money in goldif i store your life force in gold underperfect circumstances you have a usefullife at 35 yearszero percent is a useful life of foreverso zero percent is immortaltwo percent is 35 years average lifeexpectancyso that the idea that you would thinkthe life expectancy of the currency andthe civilization should be 35 yearsinstead of forever is is kind of a sillynotion but the tragic notion isit was it was you knowseven into seventy or ten yearsit's the money has had a half-life often years except for the fact thatin weak societies in inargentina or the like the half-life ofthe money isthree to four years in venezuela oneyearsothe united states dollarand the united states economic systemwas the most successful economic systemin the last hundred years in the worldwe won every war we were the worldsuperpower our currency lost 99.7percent of its value and that meanshorrifically every other currencylost everything right in essence the theother ones were 99.9 except for mostthat were 100 because they allcompletely failedand uhyou know you've got a you've got amainstream economic community you knowthat thinks thatinflation is a number and two percent isdesirableit's it's it's kind of likeyou know remember george washington youknow how he died nowell-meaning physicians bled him todeathokay the last thing in the world youwould want to do to a sick person isbleed them right in the modern world ithink we understand that that oxygen iscarried by the blood cells andandyou knowandif uhyou know there's that phrase right uh atriage phrase what's the first thing youdo in an injurystop the bleedingsingle first thing right you show upafter any action i look at you stop thebleeding because you're going to be deadin a matter of minutes if you bleed outsoit strikes me as being ironic thatorthodox conventional wisdom was bleedthe patient to death and this was themost important patientin the countrymaybe in the history of the countryand it's and we bled him to death tryingto help him so when you're actuallyinflating the money supply at sevenpercent but you're calling it twopercent because you want to help theeconomyyou're literally bleedingthe the free market to death but the sadfact is george washington went alongwith itbecause he thought that they were goingto do him goodandthe majority of of uh the society mostcompaniesmost most conventional thinkersyou knowthe working class they go along withthis because they think that someone hastheir best interest in mind and thepeople that are bleeding them to deathbelievethey they believe that prescriptionbecause their mental models are just sodefective and their understanding ofenergyand engineering andand uh and the economics that are atplayis uh is crippled by these mental modelsbut that's both the bug and the featureof human civilization that ideas takehold they unite us we believe in themuhand we make a lot of cool stuff happenbyas an average sort of just the fact ofthe mattera lot of people believe the same thingthey get together and they get somedone because they believe that thing andthen some ideas can be really bad andreally destructive but on average theideas seem to be progressingin in a direction of good let me juststep backwhat the hell are we doing here ushumans on this earthhow do you think of humans how specialare humanshow did human civilizationoriginate on this earthand what is this human project thatwe're all taking onyou mentionedfire and water and apparently bleedingyou to death is not a good idea ithought always thought you can get thedemons out in that way butum that was a recentinvention so what what's this thingwe're doing herei think what distinguishes uh humanbeings from all the other creatures onthe earth isisour ability to engineerwe're engineersright to solve problems or justbuild incredible cool thingsengineeringharnessing energy and technique to makethe world a better place than you founditright from the point that we actuallystarted to play with fireright that was a big leap forwarduh harnessing the power of of kineticenergy and missiles another another stepforwardevery city built on water why water wellwater'sbringing energy right if you actuallyif you actually put a turbine you knowon a river or you uhor you capture a change in elevation ofwater you've literally harnessedgravitational energy but you know wateris also bringing you food it's alsogiving you you knowa cheap form of uh getting rid of yourwaste it's also giving you freetransportation you want to move one tonblocks around you want to move them inwater soi think i mean the the the human storyis really the story of engineering abetter worldand and uh the rise in the humancondition is determined by those uhgroups of people those civilizationsthat were best at harnessing energyright if you if you lookyou know the greek civilization theybuilt it around around ports andseaports and and water and created atrading networkthe romans were really good atharnessing all sorts ofof engineering i mean the aqueducts area great exampleif you go to any big cityyou travel through cities in the med youfind that you know the carrying capacityof the city or the island is 5 000people without running water and then ifyou can find a way to bring water to itincreases by a factor of 10and sohuman flourishing is really onlypossible through that channeling ofenergyright that eventually takes thethe form ofair power right i meanthat shipi mean look at the intricacy of thosesalesright i mean it'sjust the model is intricate now thinkabout all of the experimentation thattook place to figure out how many salesto put on that ship and how to rig themand how to repair them andhow to operate themthere's thousands of livesspent thinking through all the tinylittle detailsall to increase the efficiency of thisthe effectiveness the efficiency of thisshipas it sails through waterand we should also note there's a bunchof cannons on the side so obviouslyanother form of en engineering rightenergy harnessing withexplosives to achieve what end that'sanother discussion exactlysuppose we're trying to get off theplanet right i mean well there's aselection mechanism going on so naturalselection this whatever howeverevolution works it seems that one of theinteresting inventions on earth was thepredator prey dynamicthat you want to be the bigger fishthat violence seems to serve a usefulpurpose if you look at earth as a wholewe as humansnowlike to think of violence as really abad thingit seems to be one of theamazing things about humans is we'reultimately tend towards cooperation wewant to we like peaceuh if you just look at history we wantthings to be nice and calmandumbut just wars break out every once in awhile and lead to immense suffering anddestruction and so on and they have akind ofuh like resetting the paletteeffect it's it's one that's full of justimmeasurable human suffering but it'slike a way to start overwe're called the apex predator on theplanetand i i googled something the other dayyou know what's the most common form ofmammallife on earthby by number of organisms count by countand the answer that came back was humanbeingsi was shocked i couldn't believe itright it says likeapparently if we're just looking atmammals the answer was human beings arethe most common which was veryinteresting to meuh i almost didn't believe it but i wastrying to you know eight billion or sohuman beingsthere's no other mammal that's got morethan eight billionif you walk through downtown edinburghand scotland and you look up on thishill and there's castle up on the hillyou know and you talk to peopleand the story is oh yeah well that wasuh that was a british casual before itwas a scottish castle before it was pickcastle before as a roman castle beforeit was you knowsome other celtic castle before you knowthen they found 13 prehistoric castlesburied one under the other under theotherand you get to you get the conclusionthat a hundred thousand years agosomebody showed up and grabbed the highpoint the apexof the cityand they built a stronghold thereand they flourished and their familyflourished and their tribe flourisheduntil someone came along and knocked himoff the hilland it's been a a nonstop never endingfight by thethe aggressive most powerful entityfamily organization municipality tribewhatever off the hill for that one hillgoing back since time and memorialandyou knowyou scratch your head andand you think it seems like it's likejust thisendingbut does not leadif you justall kinds of metrics that seems toimprovethe quality of our cannons and ships asa result like it seems that warjust like your laser eyes focuses themind on the engineering tasks it is thatand and andit does remind youthat the winner is always the mostpowerful andand we we throw that phrase out but noone thinks about what that phrase meanslike like who's the most powerful or theyou know or the most powerful side onebut they don't think about it and theythink about powerenergy delivered in a period of time andthen you thinka guy with a spear is more powerful thansomeone with their fist and someone witha bow and arrow is more powerful thanthe person with the spear and then yourealize that somebody with bronze ismore powerful than without and steel ismore powerful than bronze and if youlook at the romansyou know they persevered you know withartillery and they could stand off from800 meters and blast you to smithereensright theyyou know you study the history of thebalearic slingers right and you know youthink we invented bullets but they theyinvented bullets to put in slingsthousands of years ago they could havestood off 500 meters and put a hole inyour headright and so there was never a timewhen uh whenhumanity wasn't vyingto come up with an asymmetric form ofprojecting their own power viatechnologyan absolute power is when a leader isable to control a large amountof uh humans they'refacing the same directionworking in the same direction toleverage uh energy the most organizedsociety winsyeah when the romans wereweredominating everybody they were the mostorganized civilizationin europe andas long as they stayed organizedthey dominated and at some point theyover expanded and got disorganized andthey collapsedand uh i guess you could say that youknow the struggle of the human conditionit catalyzes the development of newtechnologies one after the other itpenalizesanybody thatrejects ocean powerright gets penalized you rejectartillery you get penalized you rejectatomic power you get penalized if youreject digital power cyber power you getpenalizedand uhand the the underlying control of theproperty keeps shifting hands fromyou know one institution or onegovernment to another based upon howrationally they're able to channel thatenergyand how well organized or coordinatedthey are well that's really interestingthing about both the human mind andgovernmentsthat they once they get a few good andcompanies once they get a few good ideasthey seem to stick with themthey reject new ideasit's almost uh whether that's emergentorhowever that evolvedit seems to have a really interestingeffect because when you're youngyou fight for the new ideas you pushthem through then a few of ushumans find success then we getcomplacentwe take over the world using that newidea and thenthe the the new young person with thebetter new ideauh challenges you and you uh as opposedto pivoting you stick with the old andlose because of it and that's howempires collapse and it's just both atthe individual level that happens whentwo academics fighting about ideas orsomething like that and at the uhat the human civilization levelgovernments they hold on to the ideas ofoldit's fascinatingyeah an ever persistenttheme in the history of science is theparadigm shift and the paradigmsshift when the old guard dies and a newgeneration arrivesor the paradigm shifts when there's awarand everyone that disagrees with theideaof aviation finds bombs dropping ontheir head or everyone that disagreeswith whatever your technology is has arude awakening and if they totallydisagree their society collapses andthey're replaced bythat new thinga lot of the engineering you talkedabouthad to do with ships and cannonsand leveraging water what about thiswhole digital thing that's happeningbeen happening over the pastcenturyis that still engineering your mindyou're starting to operate in these bitsof informationi think there's two big ideas uh thefirst waveof ideas were digital information andthat was the internet way been runningsince1990 or so for 30 years and the secondwave is digital energyso if i look at digital informationthis idea that we want to digitallytransform a booki'm going to de-materialize every bookin this room into bits and then i'mgoing to deliver a copy of the entirelibrary to a billion people and i'mgoing to do itforpretty much de minimis electricityif i can dematerialize musicbooks educationentertainmentmapsrightthatthat uh is an incrediblylike exothermic transaction it givesit's a crystallization when we collapseinto a lower energy state as acivilization we give off massive amountsof energylike if you look at what carnegie didthe richest man in the world createdlibraries everywhere at the time and hegave away his entire fortune and now wecan give a better library to every sixyear old for nothing and sowhat's the value of giving a millionbooks to aeight billion peopleright that's that's the explosion inprosperity that comes from digitaltransformationand uh when we do it with mapsyou know i i transform the map i put itinto a car you get in the car and thecar drives you where you want to go withthe mapright and how much better is that than arand mcnally atlas right here it's likeit's like a million times bettersothe first wave of digital transformationwas the dematerializationof all of these informational thingswhich are non-conservative that is youknow i could take beethoven's fifthsymphony played for by the bestorchestra in germany and i could give itto a billion people and they could playit a thousand times eachat less than the cost of the oneperformance right so so i deliverculture and education and air additionandintelligence and insight to the entirecivilizationover digital railsand the consequences of the human racearefirst order generally goodright the world is a better place itdrives growth and you create thesetrillion dollar entities like apple andamazon and facebook and google andmicrosoftright that is the first wavethe second wave do you mind i'm sorry tointerrupt but that first waveumit feels likethe impact that's positiveyou said the first order impact isgenerally positive it feels like it'spositive in a way that nothing else inhistory has been positiveand then we may not actuallytrulyuh be able to understandthe orders and magnitude ofincrease in productivity injust progress of human civilizationuh until we look back centuries from nowit just feels or maybe i'm like thatjust like just looking at the impact ofwikipediarightthegiving access to basic wisdom or basicknowledge and then perhaps wisdom tobillions of people if you can justlinger on that for a secondwhat's your sense of the impact of thatyou know ii would say if you'rea technologistphilosopherthe impact of a technology is so muchgreater on the civilization and thehuman condition thana non-technology that is almost notworth your trouble to bother trying tofix things a conventional way so let'stake example umi have a foundation the sailor academyand the sailor academy gives awayuhfree education free college education toanybody on earth that wants itand we've had more than a millionstudentsand if you go when you take the physicsclassthe lectures were by the same physicslecture that taught me physics at mitexcept when i was at mitthe cost of the first four weeks of mitwould have drained my family's lifecollective life savings for the firstlast hundred years yep like a hundredyears worth of my father my grandfathermy great-grandfather they saved everypenny they had after 100 years theycould have paid for one week or twoweeks of mit that's how fiendishlyexpensive and inefficient it was soyes i went on scholarship i was lucky tohave a scholarshipbuton the other hand i sat in the back ofthe 801 lecture hall and i was likeright up in the rafters it's an awfulexperience on these like uncomfortablewooden benches and you can barely seethe blackboard and you got to be theresynchronouslyand the stuff we upload you can start itand stop it and watch it on your ipad orwatch it on your computer and rewind itmultiple times and sit in a comfortablechair and you can do it from anywhere onearth and it's absolutely freeso i think about this and i thinkyou want to improve the human conditionyou need people withpost-graduate level education you needphds and i know this sounds kind ofelitist but you want to cure cancer andyou know you want to go to the starsfusion drive we need new propulsionright we need we need extraordinarybreakthroughsin every area of basic science you knowbe it biology or propulsion or materialscience or computer science you're notdoing that with an undergraduate degreeyou're certainly not doing it with ahigh school education but the cost of aphd is like a million bucksthere's like 10 million phds in theworld if you go do the if you check itout there's 8 billion people in theworld how many people could get a phd orwould want to maybe not 8 billion but abillion 500 million let's just say 500million to a billion how do you go from10 million to a billionhighly educated people all of themspecializinginand i don't have to tell you how manydifferent fields of human endeavor thereare i mean your life is interviewingthese experts andthere's so manyright you know it's it's it's amazing sohow do i give a multi-million dollareducation to a billion people andthere's two choicesyou can either endow a scholarship inwhich case you pay 75 000 a yearokay75 let's pay a million dollars and amillion dollars a person i can do itthat wayand you're nevereven if you had a trillion dollarsif you had 10 trillion dollars to throwat the problem and we've just thrown 10trillion dollars at certain problemsyeah you don't solve the problemright if i if i put 10 trillion dollarson the table and i said educateeverybody give them all a phd you stillwouldn't solve the problem harvarduniversity can't educateeighteen thousand peoplesimultaneously or eighty seven thousandor eight hundred thousand or eightmillion so you have to dematerialize theprofessor and dematerialize theexperience so you put it all asstreaming on demand computer generatededucationand you create simulations where youneed to create simulations and youupload itit's like the human condition is beingheld back by000 well-meaningum average algebra teachersi love them i mean please don't takeoffense if you're an algebra teacher butinstead of 500 000 algebra teachersgoing through the same motion over andover againwhat you need is is like one or five orten really good algebra teachers andthey need to do it a billion times a dayor billion times a year for freeand if we do thatthere's no reason why you can't giveinfiniteeducationcertainly inscience technology engineering and mathrightinfinite education to everybodywith no constraintand i i think the same is true rightwith just about every other thing youif you want tobring joy to the world you need digitalmusic if you want to bring you knowenlightenment to the world you needdigital educationif if you you know want to bringanything of consequence in the world yougot to digitally transform it and thenyou got to manufacture it something likea hundred times more efficiently as astart but a million times moreefficientlyis is probablyoften you know that's that's hopefulmaybe you have a chance andif you look at all of these uh spaceendeavors and everything we're thinkingabout getting to mars getting off theplanet getting to other worldsnumber one thing you got to do is yougot to make a fundamental breakthroughin an enginepeople dreamed about flying forthousands of years but until until theinternal combustion engineyou didn't have enoughyou know enough energy enough enoughpower in a light enough packagein order to solve the problemand what and the human race has allsorts of thosefundamentalenginesand materials and techniquesthat we need to master and each one ofthem is a lifetime of experimentation ofsomeonecapable of making a seminal contributionto the body of human knowledge there arecertain problems like education thatcould be solved through this pro processof dematerialization and by the wayto give props to the 500kalgebra teacherswhen i look at youtube for exampleone possible approach is each one ofthose 500 000 teachers probably had daysand moments of brilliance and if theyhad ability to contribute toin the natural selection process likethe marketof educationwhere the best ones rise up that'sthat's a really interesting way which islike the bestthe best day of your life the bestlesson you've ever taughtcould befoundand sort of broadcast to billions ofpeopleso all of those kinds of ideas can bemade real in the digital world nowtraveling across planetsyou still can't solve that problemuh with dematerialization what you couldsolve potentially isdematerializing the human brain whereyou can transfer and transfer you likeyou don't need to have astronauts on theship you can have a floppy disk carryinga human braintouching on those points you'd love forthe 500 000 algebra teachers to become500 000 math specialists and maybe theyclump into 50 000 specialties as teamsand they all pursue 50 000 new problemsand they put their algebra teaching onautopilotthat's the same that's the same as wheni give you 11 cents worth of electricityand you don't have torow uh you know row a boat eight hours aday before you can eat right yesit would be a lot better you know thatyou would pay for your food in the firsteight seconds of your day and then youcould start thinking about other thingsrightumwith regard totechnology you knowone thing that i learned studyingtechnology when you look at s-curves isuntil you start the s-curveyou don't know whether you're a hundredyears from viabilitya thousand years from viability or a fewmonths from viabilitysoisn't that fun that's so funthe the early part of the s curve is sofunbecause you don't know in 1900 you couldhave got any number of learned academicsto give you 10 000 reasons why humanswill never fly yeah right and in 1903the wright brothers flew and by 1969we're walking on the moon sothe advance that we made in that fieldwas extraordinary but for the hundredyears and 200 years before they werejust back and forth and nobody was closeand umand that's the the happy part the happypart is we went fromflying 20 miles an hour or whatever toflying 25 000 miles an hourin66 yearsthe unhappy partis i studied aeronautical engineering atmit in the 80sand in the 80s we hadgulf stream aircraft we had boeing 737swe had the space shuttleand you fast forward 40 yearsand we pretty much had the same exactaircraft this you know that theefficiency of the engines was20 30 percent more yeah right with weslammed into a brick wall around 69 to75.like in fact uh you know the globalexpress the gulf stream these are allengineered in the 70s some in the 60sthat the actualthe fuselage uh silhouette of a gulfstream of a g5 was the same shape as ag4 is the same shape as a g3 is the sameshape as a g2 and that's because theywere afraid to change the shape for 40years because they worked it out in awind tunnel i knew it workedand when they finally decided to changethe shape it was like a 10 billiondollar exercise with modernsupercomputers and computationalfluid dynamics why was it so hard whatwaswhat is what is that wall made of theslammed into but the right question isso why does a guy that went to mit thatgot an aeronautical engineering degreespent his career in softwarelike why is it that i never a day in mylifewith the exception of some air forcereserve work i never got paid to be anaeronautical engineer and i worked insoftware engineering my entire careermaybe software engineering is the newaeronautical engineering in some waymaybe like maybe you hit fundamentalwalls uncertainuntil you have to return to it centurieslateror no the national gallery of art wasendowed by a very rich manandrew mellon and you know how he madehis moneyaluminumokayand and soyeah and you know what kind of airplanesyou can create without aluminumi thinknothing right so that's a material soit's a materials problem okay so1900 we we made massive advances inmetallurgy right i mean that was thatwas u.s steel that was iron to steelaluminummassive fortunes were created becausethis was a massive technical advance andthen we also had the internal combustionengine and you know the story of fordand general motors and daimler chryslerand the like is informed by thatso you have no jet engines no rocketmotors no internal combustion enginesyou have no aviationbut even if you had those engines if youwere trying to build those things withsteelno chance you had to have aluminum sothere's liketwopretty basic technologies and once youhave those two technologies stuffhappens very fastsotell me the thethe last big advance in like jet enginesthere hasn't been onelike there had the last big advance inrocket engines how's it been one the bigadvances in spaceship design from what ican see are in the control systems thethe gyros and the ability to landright in a stable fashion that's prettyamazing landing a rocket also in the umat least according tothe elon and so on the manufacturer ofthemore efficient and less expensivemanufacturer of rocketsso like it's a production whatever thatyou call that discipline ofat scale manufacture at scale productionso factory work but it's not 10xi mean maybe it's 10x over a period of afew decades when we figure out how tooperate aspaceship you know on the water in yourwater bottle for a yearyeah right now then you've got abreakthrough so the bottom line ispropulsionpropel propulsion technology uhpropellants and the materials technologythey were critical to getting on thataviation s-curve and then we slammedinto a wallin the 70sand the boeing 747the global express the gulf stream thesethings were the space shuttlethey were all pretty much reflective ofthat and then we kind ofthen we stopped and at that point youhave to switch to a new s curve sothe nextequivalent to the internal combustionengine was the cpu and the next aluminumequipment was silicon so when weactually started developing cpustransistor gateway to cpus and if youlook at thethe powerright the bandwidth that we had oncomputers and moore's law rightwhat if the efficiency of jet engineshad doubledevery three yearsright in the last 40 years where we beright now rightsoso i i think that if you're if you're abusiness person if you're looking forcommercially viableapplication of your mindthen you have to find that s-curve andideallyyou you have to find it in the firstfive six ten yearsbut people always miss this let's takegoogle glassright google glass was a idea 2013the year is 2022and people were quite sure this wasgoing to be a big thing but it couldhave beenat the at the beginning of the s curvebut fundamentallywe didn't really have an effectivemechanism i mean people getting vertigoand they're yeah but you didn't knowthat at the beginning of thisright i mean maybe some people had adeep intuition about the fundamentals ofaugmented reality but you don't knowthat you don't have those uh you'relooking through the fog you don't knowso the point is we're year zero in 2013and we're still year zero in 2022 onthat augmented reality and when somebodyputs out a set of glassesthat you can wear comfortably withoutgetting vertigorightwithout any disorientation that managedto have the stability and the bandwidthnecessary to syncwith the real world you'll be in yearoneand and from that point you'll have a70-year or some some interesting futureuntil you slam into a limit to growthyeahand then it'll slow downandthisthis is the story of a lot of thingsright i mean john d rockefeller got inthe oil business in the 1860sand the oil business as we understood ityou know became fairly mature you knowbythe 1920s the 30s and then it actuallystayed that way until we got to frackingand like which was like 70 years laterand then it burst forwardso the interesting story about moore'slaw though is that you get this likeconstant burst of s s curves on top ofeskers on top of esker it's like themoment you start slowing downor almost ahead of you slowing down youcome up with another innovation anotherinnovation so moore's law doesn't seemto happen in everytechnological advancementit seems like you only get a couple ofs-curves and then you're done for a bitso i wonder what the pressures there arethat resulted in such success overseveral decades and still goinghumility dictates that nobody knows whenthe s curve kicks off and you could be20 years earlier 100 years earlyleonardo da vinci you know they weremichelangelo they were designing flyingmachineshundreds and hundreds of years ago sohumility says you're not quite sure whenit's when you really hit that commercialviability and it also dictates you don'tknow when it endslikewhen will the party stop when willmoore's law stop and we'll get to thepoint where they're exponentiallydiminishing returns onsilicon performanceand when you just like we gotexponentially diminishing returns on jetenginesyou knowand it just takes an exponentialincrease in effort to make it 10 percentbetterbut while you're in the middle of itthen you know you can do things sothe reason that the digital revolutionis so important is because theunderlying platforms the bandwidth ofand the performance of the componentsandi said the components are theradioprotocolsmobile protocols the uh the batteriesthe cpusand the displays rightthose those four components are prettycritical they're all they're allcritical in the creation of an iphone iwrote about it in the book the mobilewave and they catalyzed this entiremobilerevolutionbecause they have advanced and continuedto advancethey created a very fertile environmentforall these digital transformationsandthe digital transformations themselfright they they call for creativity intheir own right like like i think theinteresting thing aboutlet's take uh digital maps right whenyou when you conceptualize something asa dematerialized mapright it becomes a map becausei can put it on a display like an ipador i can put it in a car like a teslabutif you really want to figure it out youcan't think like an engineer you need tothink like a fantasy writer like this iswhere it's useful if you studied uh ifyou read played dungeons and dragons andyou read lord of the rings and youyou study all the fantasy literaturebecausebecause when i dematerialize the mapfirst i put 10 million pages ofsatellite imagery intothe map right that's a simple physicaltransformbut then i start to put telemetry intothe map and i keep track of the trafficrates on the roads and i tell youwhether you'll be in a traffic jam ifyou drive that way and i tell you whichway to driveand then i start to get feedback onwhere you're going and i tell you therestaurant's closed and people don'tlike it anywayand then i put an ai on top of it and ihave it drive your car for youand eventuallythe implication of digitaltransformation of maps is i get in aself-driving car and i say take mesomeplace cool where i can eatright and and how did you get to thatlast step right it wasn't simpleengineering there's a bit of fantasy inthere a bit of magic design art whateverthe heck you call it it's whatever yeahfantasy injectsmagic into the engineering process likeimaginationlike precedesgreatrevolutions in engineering it's likelike imagining a world likeuh of what you can do with the displayhow will the interaction be that's wheregoogle glass actually came in augmentedreality virtual reality people areplaying in the space ofsci-fiimagination they called a moon shot theytried it didn't work but to their creditthey stopped trying right it's like ohand then there's new people they keepdreaming dreamers are all all aroundus i love those dreamers and most ofthem fail and suffer because of it butsome of them when win nobel prizes orbecome billionairesbut what i would say isif half the civilizationdropped what they were doing tomorrowand eagerly started workingon launching a rocket to alpha centauriit might not be the best use of ourresources becauseit's it's kind of like if half of athensin the year 500 bc eagerly startedworking on flying machines if you wentback and you said what advice would yougive themdon't you would sayyou know it's not going to work till youget to aluminum and you're not going toget to aluminum till you work out thesteel and and certain other things andyou're not going to get to that untilyou work out the calculus of variationsand some metallurgy and there's a dudenewton that won't come along for quite awhile and he's going to give you thecalculus to do it and until then it'shopeless so you you might be better offto work on the aqueduct or to focus uponsales or something so if if i look atthis today i saythere's massive profoundenvironment civilization advances to bemade through digital transformation ofinformation and you can see them likethat this isthe story of today this is not the storyof today right it's 10 years old whatwe've been seeing we're living throughdifferent manifestations of that storytoday too though like social media uhthatthe effects of that is very interestingbecause ideas spread even you talk aboutvelocity of money the velocity of ideaskeeps increasing yeah so like wikipediais a passive store it's a store ofknowledgetwitter is like auhit's like awater hose or something it's likespraying you with knowledge whether youwant it or not it's like social media isjust like this explosion of ideas andthen we pick them up and then we try tounderstand ourselves because the dramaof italso plays with our human psyche sosometimes there's moreability for misinformation forpropaganda to take hold so we get tolearn about ourselves we get to learnabout the technology they can deceleratetheir propaganda for example all thatkind of stuff but like the reality iswe're living i feel like we're livingthrough a singularity in the digitalinformation spaceand we're not we don't have a greatunderstanding of exactly how it'stransforming our livesthis is where money is useful as a as ametaphor for significance becauseif money is the is theeconomic energy of the civilizationthen something that's extraordinarilylucrative that's going to generate amonetary or a wealth increase is a wayto increase the net energy in thecivilization and ultimatelyif we had 10 times as much of everythingwe'd have a lot morefree resources to pursue all of ouradvanced scientific and mathematical andtheoretical endeavors so let's taketwitterright twitter's something that could be10 times more valuable than it is righttwitter's twitter could be made 10 timesbetteroh by the way i should say that peopleshould follow you on twitter yourtwitter con is awesome thank youit could be made ten times better yeahyeah twitter can be made ten timesbetter uh if we takeif we take youtube or take educationwe could generate a billion phds and andthe question is do you need any profounduh breakthrough in materials ortechnology to do that answers not reallyright so if you wannayou could make apple amazon facebookgoogle twitter all these things betterthethe united states government if theytook one percentof the money they spend on thedepartment of educationand they simply poured it into digitaleducation and they gavedegrees to people that actually metthose requirementsthey could provide 100x as mucheducation for 1 100th of the cost andthey could do it with no new technologythat's aa marketing and politicalchallenge so i don't think everyobjectiveis equally practicaland i think the benefit of being anengineer or or thinking about uhpractical achievements iswhen the government pursues animpractical objective or when anybody anentrepreneurnot so bad with an entrepreneur becausethey don't have that much money wastewhen a government pursues an impracticalobjective they squander trillions andtrillions of dollars and achieve nothingwhereas if they uh pursue a practicalobjective or if the or if they simplyget out of the wayand do nothingand they allow the free market to pursuethe practical objectives then i thinkyou can have profoundimpact on the human civilizationand if iif i look atthe world we're in todayi think that therethere aremulti-trillion10 20 50 trillion dollars worth ofopportunitiesin the digital information realm yet tobe obtainedum[Music]but there's hundreds of trillions ofdollars of opportunities in the digitalenergy realmthatnot only are they not obtained themajority of peopledon't even know what digital energy ismost of them would reject the conceptthey're not looking for itthey're not expecting to find it it'sinconceivable because it is a paradigmshift but in fact it's completelypracticalright under our noseit's staring at us and it could make theentire civilization work dramaticallybetter in every every respect so youmentionedin the digital world digital informationis one digital energy is twoand the possibleimpact on the world and the set ofopportunities available in the digitalenergy spaceis much greater so how do you thinkabout the general energy what is itso i i'll start with teslahe had a very famous quote he said ifyou understand the universe think interms of energyvibration and frequencyand it gets you thinking about what isthe universe and of course the universeis just all energyand then what is mattermatter is low frequency energyand what are we you know we're vibratingfrom you know ashes to ashes dust todusti can turn a tree into lighti can turn light back into a tree if ifi consider the entire universe and it'svery important because we don't reallythink this way let's take the new yorkdisco modelwhat it if i walk into a nightclub andthere's loud music blaring in new yorkcitywhat's really going on thereright if if you blast out 15 14 billionyears ago the universe is formed okaythat's a low frequency thing theuniversefour and a half billion years ago thesun maybe the earth or formthe continents are 400 million years oldthe shift that new york city is on issome hundreds of millions of years butthe hudson river is only 20 000 yearsthere's a building that's probably 50years old there's a company operatingthat disco or that club which is 5 to 10years oldthere's a person a customer walking inthere for an experience for a few hoursthere's musicthat's uh oscillating it's somekilohertzand then there's light right and you andyou have all forms of energyall frequenciesright all layered all moving throughdifferent mediumand the co and how you perceive theworld's a question ofat what frequency do you want toperceive the worldand umi i think that once youstart to think that way youyou'recatalyzed to think about what woulddigital energy look like and andwhy would i want itand umwhat is it sowhy don't we just start right there whatis itthe most famous manifestation of digitalenergy is bitcoinbitcoin's a crypto asset it's a cryptoasset that has monetary value can wejust linger on thatbitcoin is uh is auhso it's digital asset that has monetaryvaluewhat is a digital asset what is monetarywhy use those terms versus the words ofmoney and and currency is theresomething interesting in thatdisambiguation of different termsi'd call it a crypto asset networkthe goal is to createa billion dollar blockof pure energy in cyberspaceone that i could that i could then movewith no friction at the speed of lightright it's it's the equivalent toputting a million pounds in orbithow do i actuallylaunchsomething into orbit right how do ilaunch something into cyberspace thatsuch that it moves friction free and thesolutionis a you know decentralizedproof-of-work network right satoshi'ssolution wasi'm going to establish protocol runningon a distributed set of computers thatwill maintain a constant supply of nevermore than 21 million bitcoinsubdividable by a hundred millionsatoshis eachtransferablevia transferring private keysnow the innovationis uhto create that in aethicaldurablefashion right the the ethical innovationis i want it to be property and not asecuritya bushel of cornan acre of land a stack of lumber and abar of goldand a bitcoin are all property and thatmeans they're allcommonly occurring elements in the worldyou could call them commodities butcommodity is a little bit misleading andi'll tell you why in a secondbut they're all distinguished by thefact that no one entity or person orgovernment controls themif you have a barrel of oiland you're in ukraine versus russiaversus saudi arabia versus the usyou have a barrel of oilright and it doesn't matter what thepremier in in japanor the mayor of miami beach thinks aboutyour bill they cannot wave their handand make it not a barrel of oil or acord of wood rightand so property is just a naturallyoccurring element in the universerightwhy use the word ethical and sorry to imay interrupt occasionallywhy why ethical assigned to propertybecause if it's a security a securitywould be an example of a share of astockor a crypto token controlled by a smallteamand and in the event that something is asecurity becausesome small group or some identifiablegroup can control its nature charactersupplythenit really only becomes ethical topromote it or sell it pursuant to fairdisclosuresso i'll give you maybe practical examplei'm the mayor of chicagoi give a speechmy speech i say i think everybody inchicago should own their own farmand have chicken a chicken in thebackyard and their own horse and anautomobilethat's ethicali give the same speech and i say i thinkeverybody in chicago should buy twitterstocksell their house or sell their cash andbuy twitter stockwell is that ethicalnot really but at that point you'veentered into a conflict of interestbecause what you're doing is you'repromoting um an assetwhich is substantially controlled by asmall group of people the board ofdirectors or the ceo of the company soif you know how would you feel thepresident united states said i reallythink americans should allbuy apple stockyou would you know especially if youworked at google or but you workedanywhere you'd be like why isn't hesaying buy mineright a security is umis a proprietary asset in some way shapeor form the and the whole nature ofsecurities law it starts from thisancientancient idea thou shalt not lie cheat orstealokaysoifif uh i'm going to sell you securitiesor i'm going to promote securities as apublic figure or as an influencer oranybody elseright ifif i create my own yo-yo coin or mikeycoin and then there's a million of themand i tell you that i think that it's areally good thing and mikeycoin will goup foreverright everybody buys mikeycoin and theni give 10 million to you and don't tellthe public right i've cheated themmaybe if if i have mikeycoin and i thinkthere's only two million mikeycoin and iswear to you there's only two millionand then i get married and i have threekids and my third kid is in the hospitaland my kid's gonna die and i have thisethical reason to print five hundredthousand more mikey coin or else peopleare gonna die and everybody tells meit's fineyou know i've still abused you know theinvestor right it'sit's a ethical challengeif you look at um ethics lawsum everywhere in the worldthey all boil down to having a clausewhich says that if you're a publicfigure you can't endorseany a security you can't endorsesomething that would cause you to have aconflict of interestso if you're a mayor a governor acountry a public figure an influencerand you want to promote or promulgate orsupport something using any publicinfluence or funds or resources you mayhaveit needs to be property it can't besecuritysoit goes beyond that right i mean likewould the chinese want to support anamerican companyright as soon as you look at what's inthe best interest of the human race thecivilizationyou realize thatif you want an ethical path forward uhit needs to be based oncommon propertywhich is fairand the way you get to a common propertyis through an open permissionlessprotocolif it's not open right if it'sproprietary and i know what the codesays and you don't know what the codesays that's that makes it a securityif uhif it's uh permissionedif you're not allowed on my network orif you can be censored or booted off mynetworkthat also makes it a securityumsoso when i talk about uh property i meanthe challenge here is how do i createsomething that's equivalent to a barrelof oilin cyberspaceand that means it has to be a anon-sovereign bearer instrument openpermissionless not censorablerightif i could do thatthen i could deliver you ten thousanddematerialized barrels of oiland you would takesettlement of themand you would know that you havepossession of that property irregardlessof the opinion of any politician or anycompany or anybody else in the worlduh that that's uh a really criticalcharacteristic and and it actually isit's probably one of the fundamentalthings that makes bitcoin specialbitcoin isn't just a crypto assetnetwork it's easy to create a cryptoasset network it's very harduh to create an ethicalcrypto asset network becauseyou ha you have to create onewithout any government or corporatecorporation or investor exercising intoinfluence to make it successful so openpermissionlessnon-sensorableso basically no wayfor you withoutexplicitly saying so outsourcing controlto somebody else so it's a kind ofyou have full controleven with the barrel of oilum what's the difference in between abarrel of oil and a bitcointo youwhat is thebecause you kind ofmentioned that both are property is uhyou mentioned russia and china and so onis is it the ability of the governmentto confiscatein the end governments can probablyconfiscate no matter what the asset isbut you want to lessen theum effort involved a barrel oil is abucket of physical property liquiditybitcoin is a digital property but it'seasier to confiscatea barrel of oilit's easier to confiscate things in thereal world than things in cyberspacemuch easier so that's not universallytrue some things in the digital spaceare actually easier to confiscatebecauseumjust the nature of how things moveeasily with information right so i thinkin the bitcoin world what we would sayis that is the bitcoin is the mostdifficult propertythat the human race possesses or has yetinvented to confiscate and that's byvirtue of the fact that you could takepossession of it by your private key soyou know if you got your 12 seed phrasesin your headthen that would be the highest form ofproperty right because i literally haveto crack your head open and read yourmindto take it it doesn't mean i couldn'textract it from you under duress butit means that it's harder than everyother thing you might own if you and infact it's exponentially harder if youconsider every other thing you might owna car a house a share of stockgold diamondsproperty rights intellectual propertyrights movie rights music right anythingimaginable they would all be easier byorders and orders of magnitude to seizesoso digital property and the form of ayou knowa set of private keys is by far the apexproperty of the human racein terms of ethics i want to make onemore point it's likei might say to you lexi think bitcoin is the is the best mostsecure most durable crypto asset networkin the world is going to go up foreverand there's nothing better in the worldi might be righti might be wrongbut the point is because it's propertyit's ethical for me to say thatif i were to turn around and say youknow lex i think the same aboutmicrostrategy stock mstr that's asecurity okay if i'm wrong about that ihave civil liability or other liabilitybecausebecause i could go to a board meetingtomorrow and i could actually propose weissue a million more shares ofmicrostrategy stockwhereasthe thing that makes bitcoin ethical forme to even promote is the knowledge thati can't change it if if i knewthat i could make it 42 million insteadof 21 million and i had the button backhere yeahright then then i have a differentdegree of ethical responsibility now icould tell you your life will be betterif you buy bitcoin and it might not youmight go buy bitcoin you might lose thekeys and be bankrupt and your life endsand your life is not better because youbought bitcoin rightbutit wouldn't be my ethical liability anymore than if i were to saylex i think you ought to get a farmi think you should be a farmer i think achicken in every pot you should get ahorsei think you'd be better i mean these areall uh they're allopinions expressed about propertywhich may or may not be right that youmay or may not agree withbut in a legal senseif we read the law if we understandsecurities lawand i would say you know most people inthe crypto industry you knowthey don't they didn't take companiespublic and so they're not really focusedon the securities law they don't evenknow the securities lawif you focus on the securities law thatwould say you just can't legallysell this stuff to the general public orpromote it without a full set ofcontinuing disclosures signed off on bya regulatorsoso uh there's a fairly bright line therewith regard to securities but when youget to thewhen you get to the secondary issue it'show do you actually build a worldbased on digital propertyif public figurescan'tcan't embrace it or endorse ityou see so you're not going to build abetter world based upontwitter stock if that's your idea ofproperty because twitter stock is asecurity and twitter stock is nevergoing to be a non-sovereign bearerinstrument in russia right or in chinaright it's not even legal in china rightso it's not a global permissionless openthing it will never be trusted by therest of the world andlegally it's impractical but you knowwould you really want to put a hundredtrillion dollars worth of economic valueon twitter stock if there's a board ofdirectors and a ceo that could just getup and like take half of it tomorrow theanswer is no soif you want to if you want to build abetter worldbased on digital energyyou need to start with constructing adigital propertyand i'm using property hereopen permissionless in a legal senseokay but i would also go to the nextstep and sayproperty islow frequency moneyso if you if i give you a milliondollarsand you want to hold it for a decadeyou might go buy a house with itright andthe house is low frequency money youconverted thethe million dollars of economic energyinto a structure called a house maybeand after a decade you might convert itback into energy you might sell thehouse for currencyand it'll be more worth more or lessdepending upon the monetary climate thefrequency means what here uh how quicklyit changes state how quickly doessomething vibratesoif uh if i transferten dollars from me to youfor a drinkand then you turn around you buy anotherright we're vibrating on a frequency ofevery few hours right the energy ischanging hands but it's not likely thatyou sell and buy houses every few hoursright the frequency of um of a of atransaction in real estate is every 10years every five years it's a much lowerfrequency transactionand umsowhen you think about uh what's going onhere you have extremely low frequencythingswhich we'll call property then you havemid-frequencythings i'm going to call a money orcurrencyand then you have high frequencyand that's energyand that's why i use the illustration ofyou got the building you got the lightand you got the sound and they're alljustenergy moving at different frequenciesnowbitcoin is magicaland it's it is truly the innovation it'slike a singularity because it representsthe first time in the history of humanrace that we managed to createa digitalproperty properly understoodit's it's easy to create somethingdigitalright every coupon and every skin onfortnite and roblox and and apple tvcredits and all these things they're alldigital something but they're securitiesright shares of stock are securitieswhenever anybodytransfers when you transfer money onpaypal or apple pay you're transferringin essence a security or an iouand so transferring a bearer instrumentwith final settlement in in the internetdomain or in cyberspacethat's a critical thing and andanybody in the crypto world can do thatall the cryptos can do thatbut what they can't do what 99 of themfail to do is be propertythey're securities well there's a linethere i'd like to explore a littlefurther for exampleuh what about when youum like coinbase or something like thatwhen there's an exchangethat you buy bitcoin is uh inyou start to move awayfrom this kind ofsome of thesome of the aspectsthat you said makes up a propertywhich is this umnon-sensorableand permissionless and openso in order to achieve the conveniencethe effectiveness of theof the transfer of energy you have toleverage some of these umplaces that remove the aspects ofproperty so i mean maybe you can commenton that let me give you a good model forthatif you think about the layer one ofbitcointhe layer one is is the propertysettlement layer and we're we're goingto do 350 000 transactions or less a day100 million transactions a year is thebandwidth on the layer one andit would be an ideal layer of one tomove a billion dollars from point a topoint b with the massive securitythe role of the layer one is is twothingsone thing is i want to move a large sumof moneythrough spacewith security i i can moveany amount of bitcoin in a matter ofminutesfor dollarson layer onethat the second importantfeature of the layer one is i need themoney to last foreverright i need the money indestructibleimmortal so so the bigger trick is notto move a billion dollars from here totokyo the big trick is to move a billiondollars from here to the year 2140and uh and that'sthat's what we want to solve with layerone and and the best real metaphor innew york city would be the granite orthe schistwhat you want is a city blockof a bedrock and how long has it beenthere likemillions of years it's been there andhow fast you want it to moveyou don'tin fact the single thing that's mostimportant is that it not deflectif it deflectsa foot in a hundred years it's too muchif it deflects an inch and a hundredyears you might not want thatso the layer one of bitcoin is afoundation upon which you put weight howmuch weight can you put on ityou put a trillion 10 trillion 100trilliona quadrillionhow much weight is in on the bedrock inin manhattan right think about hundredstory buildings sothe the real key there is thefoundational asset needs to be there atall so the fact that you can createa hundred trillion dollar layer one thatwould stand for a hundred years that isthe revolutionary breakthrough firsttime and the fact that it's ethicalright it's ethical and it's commonproperty global permissionless extremelyunlikely that would happenpeople tried 50 times before and theyall failed they tried 15 000 times afterand they've all been they've allgenerally failed 98 have failed and acouple have likebeen less successful butfor the most partthat'san extraordinary thing now just reallyquickly pause just to define some termsif you people don't knowlayer one is uh that michael's referringto isin general what peopleknow of as the bitcoin technologyoriginally defined which is theblockchain there's a consensus mechanismof proof of workuh low number of transactions but youcan[Music]move a very large amount ofmoney the reason he's using the termlayer one is now that there's a lot ofideas of layer two technologies built ontop of this bedrockthat allow you to move a much largernumber of transactionsum so sort of uhhigher frequency i don't know how whatterminology you want to use butbasically be able to use now somethingthat is based on bitcoin to then uh buystuff be a consumer to transfer money touse it as currencyjust to define some termsyeahsothe layer one is the foundation for theentire cyber economyand umwe don't want it to move fast what wewant what we want is is immortalityincorrupt immortal and corruptibleindestructibleright that that's what you wantintegrity from the layer one now there'slayer two and layer three and layer twoi would define as an open permissionlessnon-custodialprotocolthat uses uh the underlying layer onetoken as its as its gas fee so what'scustodial mean and how does thedifferent markets like uh is lightningnetwork so lightning network would be anexample of a layer two non-custodialso the lightning networkwill sit on top of uh of layer one it'llsit on top of bitcoinand it solves the what you want to do issolve the problem ofit's well and fine i don't want to movea billion dollars every day what i wantto move is five dollarsa billion times a dayso if i want to move five dollars abillion times a day i don't really needto put the entire trilliondollars of assets at risk every time imove five dollarsall i really need to do is put a hundredthousand dollars in a channel or amillion dollars in a channel and then ido 10 million transactions where i havea million dollars at riskand of course it's it's kind of simpleif i if i putif i lower my security requirement by afactor of a millioni can probably move the stuff a milliontimes fasterand that's how lightning works it'snon-custodial because there's no there'sno corporation or custodian orcounterparty you're trustingright there's a there's the risk ofmoving through the channelbut umlightning is an example of how i go from350 000 transactions a day to 350million transactions a day so on thatlayer too you could move the bitcoin inseconds for fractions of penniesnowthat's not the end-all be-all becausethe truth is there are a lot of openprotocols lightning probably won't bethe only one there could you knowthere's an open market competition ofother permissionless open sourceprotocols to do this workum and in theoryany any other crypto network that wasdeemed to beproperty deemed to be non-security youwould all you could also think of aspotentially a layer two to bitcoin rightthere's a debate about are there any andwhat are they and and we could leavethat for a later time but why do youthink of themas layer two as opposed to contendingfor layer oneyeah actually if they're using their owntokenthen they are a layer one if you createan open protocol that uses the bitcointoken as the as the feethen it becomes a layer two okay rightbitcoin itself right incentivizes hisown transactions with its own token andthat's what makes it layer oneokay what's layer three then layer threeis a custodial layerso if you wanna move bitcoin inmilliseconds for freeyou move it through binance or coin baseor cash appso this is a very straightforward thingi mean it seems pretty obvious when youthink about it that they're gonna behundreds of thousands of layer threesthere may be dozens of layer twos theremight i mean lightning is a1 but it'snot the only one anybody can inventsomethingright and andwe can have this debate uh aboutcustodial non-custodial umdon't you think there's amount ofmonopolization possibilities at layerthreesoumyou know coin you mentioned binance coincoinbase what if they start to dominateand basically everybody is using thempractically speaking and then it becomestoo costly tomemorize the uh the private key in yourbraini mean or like a cold storage of layerone technology the idealistfear the layer threes because they thinkand especially they did testthey would detest a bitthere's almost like a layer four by theway if you want to a layer four would bei've got bitcoin on an application but ican't withdraw itso i've got an application that's backedby bitcoin but the bitcoin is sealedit's it's a proprietary example and i'llgive you example of that that would belikegrayscaleif i own a share of gbtcand and so i own a security actuallyyou know you could own mstrif you own a security or you own aproduct that has bitcoin embedded in ityou get the benefits of bitcoin but youdon't have the ability to withdrawthe asset so you have a security marketat layer four am i understanding thiscorrectlyi don't know if i would sayi don't not all securities are layerfour but but anything that's aproprietary product based upon withbitcoin embedded in it where you can'twithdraw the bitcoinis another application of bitcoinso if if you think about different waysyou can use thisyou can either stay completely on thelayer one and use the base chain foryour transactionsor you canlimit yourself to layer one and layertwo lightning and the purist would saywe stay there get your bitcoin off theexchangebut you could also go to the layer threewhen cash app uh supported bitcoin theymade it very easy to buy it and thenthey gave you the withdrawalwhen paypal or i think robin hood letyou buy it they wouldn't let youwithdraw it and it was a big communityuproar and people wantthey want these layer threes to to makeit possible to withdraw the bitcoins youcould take it to your own private walletand get it off the exchangei think the answer to the question ofwell is corruption possible iscorruption is possible and all humaninstitutions and all governmentseverywhere the difference betweendigital property and physical propertyis when you own a building in losangelesand the citypolitics turn against you you can't movethe buildingyeah and when you own a share of asecuritythat's like a u.s traded security andyou wish to move to some other countryyou can't take the security with youeitherand when you own a bunch of gold and youtry to get through the airport theymightnot let you take it souhbitcoin is advantageous versus all thosebecause you actually do have the optionto withdraw your asset from the exchangeand if you you know if you had bitcoinwith fidelity and you had shares ofstock with fidelity and if you had uhbonds and sovereign debt with fidelityif you owned somesomeyou know mutual funds and some otherrandom limited partnerships withfidelity none of those things can beremoved from the custodian but thebitcoin you cantake off uh the exchange you can removefrom the custodian soso uhit's still possible there's a deterrentthere's a deterrent that's ananti-corrupting elementand the phrase is an armed society is apolite societyright because you have the optionalityto withdraw all your assets from thecrypto exchange you can enforce fairnessand at the point where you disagree withtheir policiesyou can within an hour move your assetsto another counterparty or take personalcustody of those assetsand you don't have that option with mostother forms of property maybe you don'thave as much optionalitywith any other form of property on earthand so what what makes digital propertydistinctis the fact that it has the mostoptionality for custodynow coming back to this digital energyissue the real key point isthe energy moves in milliseconds forfree on layer threesit moves in seconds or less than secondson layer twos it moves in minutes on thelayer oneandit i don't think it makes any sense toeven think about trying to solve allthree problems on the layer one becauseit's impossible to achieve the securityand the incorruptibility and immortalityif you try to build that much speed andthat functionality and performancein factif you come back to the new york modelyou really wanted a block of granite abuilding and a companythat's what makes the economyright if you say if i said to you you'regoing to build a building but you canonly have one company in it for the lifeof the building it would be very fragilelike very brittle what company a hundredyears ago is still relevant todayyou want all three layers because theyall oscillated different frequenciesandand you know there's a tendency to thinkwell it's it's got to be this l1 or thatl1 not really and sometimes people thinkwell i don't really want any l3 butcompaniesit's not an even war companies arebetterthancrypto asset networks at certain thingsif you want complexity you want toimplement complexity or you want toimplement complianceor customer service rightcompanies do these things wellrightwe knowyou couldn't decentralize apple ornetflix or even youtube the performancewouldn't be thereand the subtlety wouldn't be there andyou can't really legally decentralizecertain forms of banking and insurancebecause they become illegal in thepolitical jurisdiction they're in sounless you're a crypto anarchist and youbelieve in no companies and no nationstatesrightwhich it's just not very practical notanytime soon once you allow that nationstates will continue and companies havea rolethen the layered architecture followsandthe free market determines who winsfor examplethere are layer threes that uh that letyou acquire bitcoin and withdraw bitcointhere are there are other applicationsto let you acquire but not withdraw itand and they'rethey don't get the same market share butthey might give you some other advantagethere are there are certain layer threeslike jack dorsey's cache app where theyjust incorporated lightningan implementation of it souhit's a cache app so that makes it morethat makes it advantageous versus uhan application that doesn't incorporatelightningif you think aboutthe big picture the big picture is eightbillion people with mobile phones servedby a hundred million companies doingbillions of transactions an hourandand the companies are settling with eachother on the base layer in blocks of 80million at a timeand then the companies are trading withthe consumersrightinproprietary layers like layer 3 and thenon occasion people are shuffling assetsacross custodians with lightning layertwo because you don't want to pay fivedollars to move fifty dollars you wannapaya twentieth of a penny to move fiftydollarsand soall of these things create efficiency inthe economyand lex if you want to consider how muchefficiencyif if you gave me a billion dollars in20 years i couldn't find a way to tradewith another company or a counterpartyin nigerialikeno no amount of money give me 10 billiondollars i couldn't do itbecause you get shut down at the bankinglevel you can't link up a bank innigeria with the bank in the usyou get shut down at this credit cardlevel because they don't have the creditcard so they won't clearyou get shut down at the at thecompliance fcpalevel becausebecause uh if you know you wouldn't beable to implement a system thatinterfaced with somebody else's systemif it's not in the right politicaljurisdictionon the other hand three entrepreneurs innigeria on the weekend could create awebsite that would trade in thislightning economy using open protocolswithout asking anybody's permissionso you're talking about something that'slike a million times cheaperless friction and fasterto do itif you want it if you want to getmoney to movewhat do you think that looks like sothat now there's a war going on inukrainethere's other wars yemen going onthroughout the worldin in thismostdifficult of states that a nation can bein which is at waruh civil war or war with other nationswhat's the role of bitcoinin this contexti mean bitcoin's a universal trustprotocol right a universal energyprotocol if you willenglish is oneokay um what i see is a bunch offragmentation of applications forexample you know the russian payment appis not going to work in ukraine rightthe ukraine payment app is not going towork in russia the you know u.s paymentapps won't work either of those placesas far as i knowso you know and and in argentina theirpayment app may not work in certainparts of africa so what you have isis uh different local economies wherepeople spin up their own applicationscompliantwith their own local laws oryou know in in war zones not compliantbut justjust spinning up you know how do youbuild something that's not compliantwhat is the revolutionary act here whenyou don't agreewith the government or what you want tofree yourself from the constitution sohere's the thingthe when a nation is really at waris it's the the especially if it's anauthoritarian regime it's going to tryto control the popular like lockeverything down yeah the spread ofinformation how do you break throughthat do you do the thing that youmentioned which is you have to buildanother app essentially that allows youthe flow of money outside thelegal constraints placed on you by thegovernment so basically break the lawummetaphorically speaking if you want tobreak out the constraints of yourculture you learn to speak englishfor example it's not illegal to speakenglish or even if it is right itdoesn't matter but but english workseverywhere in the world if you can speakit and then you can tap into a globalcommerce and intelligence network sobitcoin is a language so you learn tospeak bitcoin or you learn to speaklightning and then you tap into thatnetwork inyou know whatever manner you can but theproblem is it's still very difficult tomove bitcoin aroundin russia and ukraine now doing warand there was asense to me thatthe cryptocurrency in general could bethe saviorfor helping people there's millions ofrefugees they're moving all all aroundit's very it's very difficult tomove money around in that space to helppeoplei think we're very earlylike like we're very embryonic here ifyou look at the who's we sorry and we asa human civilization are weoperating in the cryptocurrency space ithink the entire crypto economy is veryembryonic and and the human race'sadoption of it is embryonic we're likeone two percent down that adoption curveif you take lightning for example theyou know the first real commercialapplications of lightning are just inthe last 12 monthsyeah so we're like year one we might beapproaching year two of commerciallightning adoption and if you look atlightning adoptionlightning is not built intocoinbase it's not built into binanceit's not built into ftx it's it you knowcache app just implemented the firstimplementation but not all the featuresare built into it there'sa few dozen a dozen lightning walletscirculating out thereso i i think that you know we'reprobably going to be 36 months ofsoftware developmentat the point that umevery android phone and every iphone hasumhas a bitcoin wallet or a crypto walletin it of sortsthat's a big deal if if apple embracedlightning that's a big dealso the adoption is the thing like in awar zone adoptionum the people who struggle the most inwar are people who are weren't doingthat great before the war started theydon't have the technologicalsophistication the the hackers and allthose kinds of people will find a wayuh it's just regular people who are juststruggling to make day-by-day living andso if the adoptionpermeates the entire culturethen you can start to move money rightaround umin the digital spacewhat if from apsycho if you can psychoanalyze jackdorsey for a secondso he's one of the early adopters orhe's one of the people pushing the earlyadoption in this layer threeso inside cash app what do you make ofthe manof this decisionas a business owneras somebody playing in the space likewhat umwhy did he do it andwhat does that mean for othersat the scale that might be doing thesame so incorporating lightningnetworking incorporating bitcoin intotheir productsi think he's been pretty clear aboutthishe feels that bitcoin is an instrumentof economic empowerment for billions ofpeople that are unbanked and have noproperty rightsin the worldif you want to givean incorruptible bankto8 billion people on the planetthat's the same as asking the questionhow do you give a full educationthrough phd to 8 billion people on theplanetand the answer isa digital versionof the 20th century thing running on amobile phoneand bitcoin is a bank in cyberspace it'srun by uncorruptable software and it'sfor everybody on earthso i think when jack looks at it he'svery sensitive to the plight ofeverybody in africaif you look at africans right likeyou're going to give them banks you'renot going to put a bank branch on everycorner that's an obscene waste of energyyou're not going to run copper wiresacross the continent that's an obscenewaste of energyyou're not gonnagive them gold and you know so so howare you going toprovide people with a decent lifethat the metaphor i think is is relevanthere the biological metaphor lex is type1 diabeticif you're a type 1 diabetic you can'tform fat and if you can't form fatthen you can't store excess energy sothat means that i mean fat is theultimate organic battery and if you'vegot 30 pounds of it you can go 60 dayswithout eatingbut if you can'tgenerate insulin you can't form fatcells if you can't form fat cells andstore energy then you can eat yourselfto death i mean you will eat and youwill die you're starved to deathso the lack of property rightsis like being a type one diabeticand so if you look at most peopleeverywhere in the worldthey don't have property rightsthey don't have effective bank and theydon't and their currency is brokenlike what are what are the two thingsthat in theory would serve as theequivalent of auh of uhan organic battery or an economicbattery to civilization would bei have a currency which holds its valueand i can store it in a bank so a riska risk-freecurrency derivativei yeah i pay you your money you takeyour life savings you put it in the bankyou save up for your retirement you livehappily ever after that's the americandreamright that's the idyllic situationthe real situation isthere are no banks you can't get a bankaccount so i give you your pay incurrency and then i double the supplyand i give it to my cousinor i give it to whatever clause i wantor i use it to buy weapons and then youfind a loaf of bread cost triple nextmonth is what it cost and your lifesavings is worthlessand so in that environmenteverybody's ripped back to stone agebarterand the problem with that even stone agebarter isyou're going to carry your life savingson your back and what happens when theguy with a machine gun points it at yourhead and just takes your life saving soso i think from jack's point of viewhe thinks that lifeis this is maybe too strong but i theseare my words life is hopeless for a lotof peopleand bitcoin is hoperight because because it gives everyoneuman engineeredmonetary asset that's a bearerinstrumentand it gives them a bank on their mobilephoneand they they don't have to trust theirgovernment or another counterpartywith their life forcesoi there's a secondary thing i think he'sinterested in which isthe first thing is the human rightsissue and the second thing would bethe friction to to trade cross bordersis so great rightyeah like uhi i you know you're like aiso i'll give you a beautiful notionmaybe one day there'll be anartificially intelligent creature incyberspacethat is self-sufficient and richlike that we would have sovereigntycan a robotown money or propertyhow about kind of tesla car can iactually put enough muff money in a carfor it to drive itself and maintainitself forever or can i create anartificially intelligent creature incyberspace that is endowedsuch that it would live a thousand yearsand continue to do its jobrightyou know we have a word for that in thereal world it's institution harvardcambridge stanford right there areinstitutions with endowments that go onin perpetuitybut what if i wanted to perpetuatea software programand umwith uh with something like digitalproperty with bitcoin and lightningyou could do itand on the other handwith uh banks and credit cardsyou couldn'trightyou couldn't ever so so you can createthings that are beautifuland lastinguh and uh what's the difference in speedwellsoi can either trade with everybody in theworldat the speed of light friction free in24 hours writing a python script ori can spend 100 billion dollars to tradewith a few million people in the worldafter it takes them six monthsof application the impedanceis like a 10 million to one differenceright and the metaphors are literallylike launching something in orbit versusalmost orbit or vacuum sealing somethingdoes it last forever and does it orbitforever or does it go up and come downand burn upright and i think jack is interested inyou knowputting freedom in orbit all rightputting freedom putting freedom in orbitand he said it many times he said thisis the the internet needs a nativecurrency yeah right and andno political construct or securitycan be a native currency you need aproperty and you need a property thatcan be moved a million times a secondcan you oscillate it at 10 kilohertz or100kilohertz and the answer isonlyif it's a pure digital constructpermissionless and openand so i think he that he's enthusiasticas the technologist and he'senthusiastic as the humanitarianand what he's doingis uh to support both those areas he'ssupporting the bitcoin and the lightningprotocol by building them into hisproducts but he's also building theapplicationswhich you need at the cash app level inorder to commercializeand deliver the functionality andcompliance necessary andthey're relatedandi should also say he's just afascinating person ifor a random reasonthat i couldn't even explain if i triedi met him a few days ago and gave him agreat big hug in the middle of nowherethere was no explanation he justappeared that's a fascinating human hisrelationship with art with the worldwith human suffering with technology isfascinatingum i don't i don't know what his pathlooks like but it's interesting thatpeople like that existand in part i'm saddened that he nolonger is involved with twitterdirectly as a ceobecause i was hoping something insidetwitter would alsointegrate some of these ideasof what you're calling digital energyum to see how social networks somethingi'm really interested in and passionateabout could be transformedlet me ask you just for educationalpurposeswhat's the uhcan you please explain to me what web 3and the beef between jack and marcandreessen is exactly did you see whathappened sorry to have you analyzetwitter like it's shakespeare butcan you please explain to me why whythere was any any drama over this topicfirst of all web 3is a term that's used uh to refer toyou know the part of the economy that'sthat's token finance so if i'm launchingan application and my ideas is to createa token along with the applicationand issue the token to the community soas to finance the application and buildsupport for iti think that uhi think that that's the most commoninterpretation of web three there areother interpretations too and so i'mjust gonna refer to that one and i thinkthe beefin a nutshell not articulated but i'llarticulate it iswhether or notyou should focus all your energycreating applications on top of anethical digital property like bitcoinor whether you should attempt to createa competitorto itwhichgenerallywould be deemed as a security by thebitcoin community so i'm going to put onmy bitcoin hat here yeah right all thetokens that have been if it's driven bya venture capitalist was a security ifthere's a ceo and a cto it's a securityall these projects they're companiesfoundations or companies right if youcall them a project or a foundation itdoesn't make itnot a security they're all in essenceum collections of individuals that areissuing equity in the form of a tokenand if if there's a pre-mine an ipoan ico a foundation or any kind ofany kind of uh protocol where there is aa group of engineers that have influenceover itthento a securities lawyer or or you know tomost bitcoiners and definitely toanybody that's steeped in securities lawyou're looking to say well that passesthe howie testit's uh it looks like a security itshould be sold to the public pursuant toyou know disclosures and regulationsand you're just ducking the ipo processright and and sonow we get back to the ethical issuewell the the ethical issue isif you're trading it as a commodity andrepresenting it as a commodity whiletruthfully it's a security you know thenit's a violation of ethics rules andit's probably illegal well you're youkeep leaning on this let me push back onthat part maybe you can educate me butyou keep leaning on this line ofsecurity's law as ifitwith all due respect to lawyersas as ifthat line somehow defines what it whatisn't isn't ethical i think there's alot of uh correlation as you'vediscussed but and i'd like to leave theline aside iuh if the law calls something as asecurity it doesn't mean in my eyes thatit is unethical i mean there could besome technicalities andlawyers and people play games with thiskind of stuff all the time but i takeyour bigger point that if there's a ceothere's a project lead that'sfundamentally well that that's you isfundamentally different thanthe the structure of bitcoin it's notthat creating securities is unethical ii created security i took a companypublicrightthat's not the unethical part it'scompletely ethical to create securitiesyou know block is a security allcompanies are securitiesthe unethical part is to represent it asproperty when it's a security and and uhto promote it or trade it as suchthis whole promotionthat's also a technical thing becauseyou'reilike what what counts as a not aspromotion is a legal thing and you getin trouble for all these things but thatthat's the the game that lawyers playthere's an ethical thing here which islike what's right to promote and not youknow uhto me propaganda is unethicalbut it's usually not illegal[Laughter]you're still talk back 20 yearsrightall the boiler room pump and dumpschemes were all about someone pitchinga penny stock you know selling swamplandin floridaand uhif you roll the clock back forward 20years and i create my owncompany and i represent it as the samething and i don't make the disclosuresright you're you're just one stepremoved from the boiler room scheme andthat's what's distasteful about itthere are ways to sell securities to thepublic but there arebut there are expectationsmaybewe could forget about whether thesecurity laws are ethical or not right iwill leave that alone we'll just startwith the biblical definition of ethicsyes don't lie cheat or stealso if i'm going to sell something to youi need to fully disclose what i'mselling to youright and and thatthat's a matter of great debate rightnow and umso i think that that's part of thedebate but the other part of the debateiswhether or not we need more than onetokenlike uhwe need at least one right we need atleast one digital property one isbecause zero means there is no digitaleconomy yes and by the way you knowthe conventional view of maximalist isthey think there's only one andeverything else isn'tthat's not the point i'm going to make ii would say we know there is that asthere is at least one digital propertyand that is bitcoinif you can create a truly decentralizednon-costyou know bearer instrumentthat is not under the control of anyorganizationthat is fairly distributedthen you might create another ormultiple and there may be others outtherebuti think that uh the frustration of a lotof people in the bitcoin community and ishare this with jack iswe could create a hundred trilliondollars of value in the real worldsimply by building applications on topof bitcoinas a foundationand so continually trying to reinventthe wheeland uh and create uh competitive thingsis a massivewaste of time and it's diversion ofhumanuhhuman creativity it's likewe we have an ethical good thingand now we're going to try to create athird or a fourth onewhywell let's talk about it so um first ofall i'm with you but let me ask you thisinteresting question because we talkedabout properties and securities let'stalk about conflict of interestso you said you could advertise publicyou have a popular twitter accountit'sit's hilarious and insightfuluh you do promote bitcoinin a sense i don't know if you would saythatbut do you think there's a conflict ofinterest in anyone who owns bitcoinpromoting bitcoin is it the same as youpromoting the farmingi would say nothere's an interesti think that i think that um you canpromotea propertyor an ideato the extent that you don't control iti think that the point at which youstart to havea conflict of interest is when you'repromoting a proprietary product orproprietary security a security ingeneral's proprietary asset so forexample if you look at my twitteryou will find that i make lots ofstatements about bitcoin you won't eversee me making a statement that saymicrostrategy stock will go off foreverright i'm not promoting a security mstrbecause at the end of the day mstr is asecurity it is proprietary i haveproprietary interest in it i have adisproportionate amount of control andinfluence on the directionthe control is the problem because youhave interest in bothyou can very if bitcoin is as successfulas we're talking about you are verypossibly can become the richest human onearthgiven how much you own in bitcoin rightthe wealthiest not the richest i don'tknow what those words meani would benefit economically economicyou would benefit economically that'strue so thethe reason that's not conflict ofinterest is because uhthe word propertythat bitcoin is an idea andit's bitcoin is openi don't control it in essence the thethe ethical line hereis could i print myself 10 million morebitcoin or notrightwhy can't anyone right it's not just youit's it can can anyonebecause can you promote somebody else'syes i guess you canlike if you can you can promote uhappleyou could have a twitter account whereyou promote oil or you promote campingor you promote family values or promoteyou know a carnivore diet or promote theiron man right that those are not goingto get wealthier if you promote campingbecause you can't own a steak and i meanyou own a lot of bitcoin what is thatwhat is that what the game don't you ownat the stake in the ideayeah i would i would grant you thatbut the lack of controlis the fundamental ethical line that youjust you don't haveall you are is you're a fan of the ideayou believe in the idea and the power ofthe ideayeah i think you can't take that ideaaway from otherslet's come back to let me give you somemaybe easier examples if you were thehead of the marine corpsrightand uhand someone came to you and said icreated marine coinand uh and the twist on marine coin isis i want you to tell every marine thatthey'll get an extra marine coin youknowwhen they when they get their nextstripeand then i'm gonna give you you know i'mgonna let you buy marine coin now andthen after you buy marine coin i wantyou to like uh promote itto themrightat some pointif if you start to have adisproportional influence on it or ifyou're in a conversation with peoplewith disproportionate influence becomesconflict of interest and it would makeyou profoundly uncomfortable i thinkyeah if the head of the marine corpsstarted promoting anything that lookedlike a securitynow if the head of the marine corpsstarted promoting canoeingyou might think he's kind of wacky likemaybelike that's kind of a waste of time adistraction so but butbut to the extent thatcanoeing is not a security not a problemunless you you knowultimately the the issue ofdecentralization is really a criticismnot having a head one so is is itsomethingcan bitcoinbe replicatedso the all the things that you're sayingthat make it a property can that bereplicated have any other possible tocreate othercrypto properties does it does thehaving a headlike of a projecta thing that limits its ability to be aproperty if you if you try to replicatea projectis that the fundamental flaw i look i ithink the real fundamental issue is youjust never want it to changelike like uhif you really want somethingdecentralizedyou want a genetic template thatsubstantially is not going to change fora thousand years so i think satoshi saidit at one point he said the nature ofthe software is such that by version .1its genetic code was setif if there was any development teamthat's continually changing it you knowon a routine basis it becomes harder andharderto maintain its decentralization becausenow now there's the issue of who'sinfluencingthe changes yeah so what you really wantisis a very very simpleidea right the simplest idea i'm justgoing to keep track of who owns 21million parts of energyand when someone proposes big functionalupgradesyou almost don't you don't really wantthat development to go on the base layeryou want that development to go on thelayer threes becausenow cache app has a proprietary set offunctionality and it's asecurity and if you're going to promotethe use of this thing you're not goingto you're not going to promotethelayer 3 security because that's a anedge to a given entity and you'retrusting the counterparty you're gonnapromote the layer one or at mostthe layer twookay so one of the fascinating thingsabout bitcoinand sorry to romanticize certain notionsbut satoshi nakamoto that the founder isanonymousmaybe you can speak to whether that'susefulbut also i just like the psychology ofthat to imagine that there's a humanbeing that was able to create somethingspecial and walk awayso first are you satoshi nakamotoi'm certain i'm not[Laughter]umno i actually i you know i think theprovidence is really important and if iwere to look at the highlighted points ithinkhaving a founder that was anonymous orsit anonymous is important i think thefounder disappearing is also important ithink that the fact that the satoshicoins never moved is also importanti think the the lack of an initial coinoffering is also important i think thelack of a corporate sponsor is importanti think the fact that it traded for 15months with no commercial valuewas also importantyou know i i think that umthe simplicity of the protocoland is very important i think that thethe outcome of the block size wars isvery important and all of those thingsadd up tocommon property they're they're allindicia indicators of a digital propertyas opposed to securityif there was a satoshi sitting aroundsitting on top of50 billion dollars worth of bitcoin itwould i don't think it would umbitcoin as property but i think it wouldundermineits digital property and if i wanted toundermine a crypto asset network i woulddo the opposite of all those thingsi would launch one myself i would sell25 or 50 percent of the general public iwould keep some of the initial i wouldpre-mine some stuff or early mine it youknow and i would keep an influence on itthose are allthe opposite of what you would do inorder to create common propertyand so i see the entire story is satoshigiving a giftof digital propertyto the human raceand disappearingdo you think it was one person do youhave ideas of who it could be idon't care to speculatebut do you think it was one personlike it was one personmaybe in conjunction with a bunch ofothers i mean it might have been a groupof people that were working together butcertainly the there's a satoshi i meanit's just so fascinating to me that oneperson could be so braveand thoughtful or do you think a lot ofhis accent like the block size wars thedecision to make a block a certain sizeall the things you mentioned led up tothe characteristics that make bitcoinpropertydo you think that's an accidentor it was deeply thought throughlike how does this is almost like ahistory of science questions peopletried it for they tried 40 of them righti mean i i think there's a there's ahistory of attempting to createsomething like this and it was triedmany many times and and they failed fordifferent reasons and i think thatit's like prometheus tried to start afire 47 times and maybe the 48th timeit's sparkedand and that's how i see this this isthe first one that's sparkedand uh and it sets a road map for us andi and i thinkif you're looking for any one word thatit's fair the whole point of the networkis it's a fair launch of fairdistributionlikeyeahi have bitcoin but i bought itin fact you know at this point we'vepaid four billion dollars of you realcash to buy itif if i was sitting on the same positionand i had it for freethen there's always this question ofdid i pay you know or i bought it for anickel a coin or a penny a coin thequestion is was it fair and and that's avery hard question to answerright did you acquire the bitcoin thatyou own fairlyand if you roll the clock back you knowyou could have bought it for a nickel ora dime but that was when it was amillion times more likely to failright when the risk was greater the costwas lower and then over time the riskbecame lower and the cost became greaterand the real critical thing was to allowthe marketplace absent any powerfulinterested actorright it's almost if satoshi had held amillion coins and then stayed engagedfor 10 more years tweaking things in thebackground there'd still be thatquestionbut what we've got is really a beautifulthing we've got awe've got a chain reaction in cyberspaceor an ideology spreading virally in theworldthat umthat has seasoned in a fairethical fashion sometimes it's a veryviolent brutal fashion with all thevolatilityright and there's been a lot of you knowa lot of sound and fury along the wayhow do you psychoanalyze how do you dealfrom a financial from a humanperspective with the volatility youmentioned you could have gotten it for anickel and the risk was greatwhere's the risk today what's your senseyou know we're 13 years end to thisentireactivity i think the risk has never beenlower i i if you look at all the risksright the risk the risks in the earlyyearsareis the engineering protocol proper likeone megabyte block size 10 minute clockfrequency cryptography cryptographiesfirst will it be hacked or will it crash730 000 blocks and it hasn't crashedwill it be hacked hasn't been hacked butyou know it's a lindy thing right youwait 13 years to see if it'll be hackedbut on the other handwith a billion dollars it's not asinteresting a target as it is with ahundred billion and when it gets to beworth a trillionthen it's a bigger target soso the risk has been bleeding off overtime as the network monetizedi think the second question is will itbe bannedyou couldn't know it could it literallycould have been banned at any time manytimes early on in fact in 2013 i tweetedon that subject i thought it would bebanned i i made a very fame infamousfamous tweet i thought it was it wasgonna be bannedin 2014 the irs um designated it asproperty and gave it property taxtreatment okay sothey they could have given it a taxtreatment where you had to pay tax on onthe unrealized capital gainsevery year and it probably would havecrushed it to deathright you know soso it could have been in anyin any number of places banned by agovernment but in fact it waslegitimized as propertyand then the questions would it behacked or would it be copied well it'dbe something better than that and it wascopied 15 000 times and you know thestory of all those andand they either diverge to be somethingtotally different and not comparable orsomeone trying to copya non-sovereign bearer instrument storeof value found that the their networkscrashed to be one percent of whatbitcoin is sonow we're sittingat a point where all those risks are outof the out of the wayi would say that year one ofinstitutional adoptionis uh it started august2020 that's when microstrategy bought250 million dollars worth of bitcoin andwe put that on the wire we were thefirst publicly traded company toactually buyuhbitcoin i don't think you could havefound a five million dollar purchasefrom a public company before we did thatso that was kind of like a gun going offand then in the next 12 monthstesla bought bitcoin square boughtbitcoin and i'd say now we're in yeartwo of institutional adoption and uhabout 24 should be 24 publicly tradedbitcoin miners by the end of thisquarterso you're looking at 36 publicly tradedcompaniesand you've got50at least in a range of 50 billiondollars on the balance of bitcoin on thebalance sheet of publicly tradedcompaniesand hundreds of billions of dollars ofmarket capof bitcoin exposed companiesso i i would say the assetdecade one was entrepreneurialexperimentaldecade two is a rotation fromentrepreneurs institutions and isbecoming institutionalized so maybedecade one you go from zero to atrillion and a decade two you go fromone trillion to a hundred trillion whatabout governments uh government adoptioninstitutional adoption is ourgovernments important in this maybemaking itsome governmentsincorporating it into as a currency intotheir banksuh all that kind of stuff is thatimportant and if if it is when when willit happenit's not essential for the success ofthe asset class but i think it's it'sinevitable in various degrees over timebut the most likely thing to happen nextis umlarge uh acquisitions by institutionalinvestorsof bitcoin as a digital gold wherethey're just swapping out gold for fordigital gold and thinking of it likethatand the government entities most likelyto be involved with that would besovereign wealth fundsif you look at all the sovereign wealthfunds that are holding a big tech stockuh equities the swiss the norwegians themiddle easternersif you can hold big tech then holdingdigital gold would beyou know not not far removed from thatthat's a non-controversialadoptioni think there are there areopportunities for governments that aremuch more profound right if a governmentstarted to adoptbitcoin as a treasury reserve assetthat's much bigger than just aan asset investment that's 100 x biggerand you could imagine that's like atrillion dollar opportunity like anygovernment that wanted to adopt it as atreasury reserve asset would probablygenerate trillions of dollars a trillionor more of value and then you know thething that people think about is wellwill oil ever be priced in bitcoinor any other export commodityi think there's like 1.8 trilliondollars or more of export commoditiesin the world and right now they're allpriced in dollars i i think that this isa colorful thing but it's not reallythat relevant like you could sell allthat stuff in dollars that the relevantdecision that any institution makeswhether they're a non-profit auniversity a corporation or a governmentis what's your treasury reserve assetand if your treasury reserve asset isthe peso and if the peso'slosing 20 or 30 of its value a yearthenyou know your your balance sheet iscollapsingwithin five yearsand if the treasury reserve asset is uhis dollars andcurrency derivatives and u.s treasuriesthen you're getting yourseven right now it's probably 15 percentor moreuh monetary inflation we're runningdouble the historic average you couldargue triple somewhere between doubleand triple depending uponwhat your metric isso you know do i think it'll happen ithink that they're conservative but theyhave to be shocked and i think there isa shockthe the late russiansanctions are a big shock that when thewest sees 300 billion dollars worth ofrussian gold and currency derivatives ithink ityou know you got the famous quote byputin that you knowwe have to rethink our our treasurystrategies and that pushes everybodytoward a commodity strategy whatcommodities do i want to holdi think that's got a lot of peoplethinking i think it's got the chinesethinking everybody wants to be thereserve currency right so if i buy 50billion dollars worth of dollars everyyear theni buy 500 billionover a decade and i probablypay250 billion dollars of inflation cost onthe backs of mycitizens in a decade soso inflation could be one of the sourcesof shockand you wonder if there is a switch tobitcoin whether it would be a bang or awhimperlike what is the nature of the shock ofthe transition i think that uhthe year 2022 is pretty catalyticfor digital assets in general and forfor bitcoin in particular the canadiantrucker crisisi think educated hundreds of millions ofpeople and andmade them startquestioning their property rights andtheir banksi think theukraine warwas a second shock but i think that therussian sanctions was a third shockyeah i think all three of the and i ithink hyperinflation in the rest of theworld is a fourth shock and thenpersistent inflation the us is a fifthshockso i think it's a perfect stormand if you put all these events togetherwhat do they signify they signify therational conclusion for any personthinking about this isi'm not sure if i can trust my propertyi don't know if i have property rights idon't know if i can trust the bankand if i'm politically at odds withwith uh the leader of my own country i'mgoing to lose my property andif i'm politically at odds with theowner of another countryi'm still going to lose my propertyand when push comes to shove the bankswill freeze my assets and seize themand i think thatthat that is playing outin front of everybody in the worldsuch thatyour logicalresponse would bei'm going to convert myweak currency to a strong currencylike i'll convert my peso and lira tothe dollar i'm going to convert my weakproperty to strong propertyi'm going to sell my buildingdowntown moscowand i'd rather owna building in new york city i'd ratheri'd rather own in a powerful nation thanathan be stuck with a building in nigeriaor a building in argentina or whateverso i'm going to sell my weak propertiesby strong properties i'm going toconvert my physical assets to digitalassetsi'd rather own a digital building thanon a physical buildingbecause if i had a billion dollarbuilding in moscow who can i rent thattobut if i have a billion dollar digitalbuilding i can rent it to anybody in anycity in the worldanybody with money and the maintenancecost isalmost nothing and i can hold it for ahundred years okay so it'sindestructible building and then finallyi want to move fromhaving my assets in a bank with acounterparty to self-custody assetsright so and and this is notit's not just ukraine but this is likethe story in turkey lebanon syriaafghanistan iraqsouth americayou don't really want to be sitting with10 million dollarsin a bank in istanbul the bank's gonnafreeze your money convert it to liradevalue the lira and then feed it backto you over 17 years right soself-custody assets would be layer onebitcoinself-custody assets it's likeif i if i got my own hardware wallet andi've either gotuh[Music]your your highest form of self-custodywould be bitcoin on your own hardwarewallet or bitcoin in your ownself-custody and the other the otherthing people think about is how do i getcrypto dollars like tetherlike some stable coin yeah like i'drather if you had a choice would yourather have your money in a bank in awar zone in dollars or have your moneyin a stable coin on your mobile phonein dollarsright i mean you take the latter riskrather than the former war zonedefinitely yeahand you can see that happening likewe've gone from 5 billion in stablecoins to 200 billion yeah in the last 24months yeah so i do think there'smassive demandfor uh crypto dollars in the form of aus dollar asset and there'sand everybody in the world would sayyeah i want thatwellunless you're just an extreme patriotbut most people would say i want thatand then a lesser group of people wouldsay i think i want to be able to carrymy property in the palm of my handso i have self-custody of itso a bitcoin price has gone throughquite a roller coasterwhat do you think is the high point it'sgoing to hiti mean they don't go up forever right imean i i think the bitcoin is is goingtoit's going to climb in a serpentinefashion it's going to advance and comeback and it's going to keepit's going to keep climbingi think that the volatility attracts allthe capital into the marketplace and sothe volatility makes it the mostinteresting thing in the financialuniverse it also generates massive yieldand massive returns for tradersand that attracts capital like we'retalking about the difference betweenfive percent return and 500 returnsothe fast money is attracted by thevolatilitythe volatility's been decreasing year byyear by year i think that um that it'sstabilizingi don't think we'll see as muchvolatility in the future as we have inthe pasti think that um[Music]if we look at bitcoin and model it as uhdigital gold you know the market capgoes to between 10 and 20 trillionbutgold is remember gold is is defectiveproperty gold is dead moneyyou have a billion dollars of gold thatsays in a vault for a decade it's veryhard to mortgage the gold it's also veryhard to rent the gold you can't loan thegold no one's going to create a businesswith your goldso gold that doesn't generate much of ayield so for that reason most peoplewouldn't store a billion dollars for adecade in gold they would buy a billiondollars of commercial real estatepropertyand the reason why is because i can rentit and generate a yield on it that's inexcess of the maintenance cost so if youconsider digital propertythat's a hundred to two hundred trilliondollaruh addressable market so i would thinkit you know it goes from ten trillion toa hundred trillion as people start tothink of it as digital property whatdoes that mean in terms of priceuh per per coin at 500 000right that's a 10 trillion dollar assetat 5 million that's a 100 trilliondollar asset so i think it crosses amillion it can go even higheryeah i think it keeps going up forever imean there's no reason we couldn't go to10 million a coin right becausedigital property isn't the highest formright gold was that low frequency moneyproperty is a mid-frequency money butwhen i start towhen i start to um program itfaster it starts to look like digitalenergyand andthen it doesn't just replace propertythen you're starting to replace bondsit's 100 trillion in bonds there's50 to 100 trillion in other currencyderivativesand then and then and these are allconventional use cases right i thinkthatthere's 350trillion to 500 trillion dollars worthof currency currency derivatives in theworldand that and when i say that i meanthings that are valued based upon fiatcash flows any commercial real estateany bond any sovereign debt any anycurrency itself any derivatives to thosethingsthey're allderivatives and they're all defectiveand they're all defective because ofthis persistent to 14 percentlapse inflate which we call inflation ormonetary expansion can we switch uhsubjects to talk about the energy sideof it like theinnovative piece yeah let's just startwith this idea that i've got a a hotelwith a billion dollars with a thousandroomswhen it becomes a dematerialized hoteli love that word so much by the way doyou materializewe're crossing the fountain blow hereimagine the fountain blow isdematerialized yeahthe problem with the physical hotel is igot to hire real people moving subjectto the speed of sound and physics lawsand newton's laws and i can rent it topeople in miami beachbut it was a digital hotel i could rentthe room to people in paris london andnew york every nightand i can run it with robotsand as soon as i do that i can rent itby the room hour and i can run it by theroom minute and so i start to chop myhotel up intoa hundred thousand room hours that isell to the highest bidder anywhere inthe worldand you can see all of a sudden theyieldthe rent and the income of the propertyis dramatically increasedi can also see the maintenance cost ofthe property fallsi get on moore's lawand i'm operating in cyberspace so i gotrid of newton's laws i got rid of allthe friction and all the all thoseproblems i i tapped into the benefits ofcyberspacei created a global propertyi started monetizing at differentfrequencies and of course now i canmortgage it to anybody in the worldright i mean you're not going to be ableto get a mortgage on a turkish buildingfrom someone you know in south africayou have to have to find someone that'slocal to theculture you're insowhen you start to move from analogproperty to digital property it's notjust a little bit better it's a lotbetter and what i just described lex islike the defyvision right it's it's the beauty of d5flash loans money moving at highvelocityat some pointifif the hotel is dematerializedthen what's the difference betweenrenting a hotel room and loaning a blockof stockright i'm just finding the highest bestuse of the thingit feels like the magic really emergesthough whenuh you build a lot a market of layer twoand layer three technologies on top ofthat so likeummaybe you can correct me if i'm wrongbut for all these hotels and all thesekinds of ideas it's alwaystouching humans at some pointand theumyou know consumers or humans businessowners and so on so you have to createinterface you have to createservices that make all that superefficient super fun to use pleasanteffective all those kinds of things soyou have to build a whole economy on topof that yeah i happen to think thatwon't be doneby the crypto industry at all i thinkthat'll be done by centralizedapplicationsi think it'll be you know the citadelsof the world the high-speed traders ofthe world the new yorkersi think i think it'll bebinance ftx and coin base as a as alayer 3 exchange that will give you theyield and will give you the loanand the the best termsbecause ultimately you have to jumpthese compliance hoops it's a it comeslike block fi can give you yield butthey have to do it in compliant way withthe united states jurisdictionso ultimately those applications to usethat digital property and eithereithergenerate a loan give you a loan on it orgive you yield on it are going to comefrom companies but the differencethe fundamental difference isit could be companies anywhere in theworld so if a company in singaporecomes up with a better offeringright then the capital is going to startto flow to singapore i can't send 10city blocks of la to singapore to rentduring a festival but i can send 10blocks of bitcoin to singaporeso you've got a truly global marketthat's functioning and this asset andit's a second order asset for examplemaybe you're an american citizen and youown 10 bitcoin and someone in singaporewill generate 27 yield in the bitcoinbut legally you can't send the money tothem or the bitcoin to them it doesn'tmatter because the fact that that existsmeans that someone in hong kong willborrow the 10 bitcoinfrom somebody in new york and then theywill put on the trade in singapore andthat will create a demand for bitcoinwhich will drive up the price of bitcoinwhich will result in an effectivetax-free yield for the person in the u.sthat's not even in the jurisdictionso there's nothing that's going on insingapore to drive up the price of yourland in l.abut there is something going oneverywhere in the world to drive up theprice of property in cyberspace ifthere's only one digital manhattan andsothere'sthere's a dynamic there which isprofound because it's globalbut now let's go to the next extreme i'mstill giving you a fairly conventionalideawhich is let's just loan the money faston a global network and let's just rentthe hotel room fast in cyberspacebut now let's move tomaybe a moreinnovative idea the first generation ofinternet you know brought a lot ofproductivity but there's also just a lotof flaws in itfor example twitter is full of garbageinstagram dms are full of garbage yourtwitter dms are full of garbageyoutube is full of scamsevery 15 minutes there's a michaelsayler bitcoin giveaway spun up onyoutube yepmy office 365 inbox is full of garbagemillions of spam messages i'm runningfour differentemail filtersmy company spends million dollars a yearto fight denial of service attacks andall sorts of othersecurity things there are denial ofservice attacks everywhere againsteverybody in cyberspace all the timeit's extreme and we're all beset withhostility right you you've been a victimof it in twitter i'm you know you go ontwitter and and people post stuff theywould never say to your face and then ifyou look you find out that the accountwas created like three days agoand it's not even a real personsoyou know we're beset with phishingattacks and scams and spam bots andgarbage and whyand the answer is because the firstgeneration of internet was digitalinformation and there's no energythere's no conservation of energy incyberspacethe thing that makes the universe workis conservation of energy like if i wentto a hotel roomi'd have to post a credit card and thenif i smashed the place upthere'd be economic consequencesmaybe criminal consequencesthere might be reputational consequencesyou know a lamp might fall on mebut in the worst case i can only smashup one hotel roomnow imagine i could actually write apython script to send myself to everyhotel room in the world every minutenot post a credit card and smash themall upanonymouslyrightthe thing that makes the universe workis frictionspeed of sound speed of lightand the fact thatthat it's ultimately it's conservativeyou're either energy or your matter butonce you've used the energy it's goneand you can't do infinite everythingthat's missingin cyberspace right now and if you lookat thelook at all of the moral hazards and allof the product defects that we have inall of these productsmost of them 99 of them could be curedif we introducedconservation of energy into cyberspaceand that's what you can do withhigh-speed digital property high-speedbitcoin and and by high-speed i mean not20 transactions a day i mean 20 000transactions a daysohow do you do that well umi let everybody on twitter post athousand or ten thousand satoshis via alightning wallet a lightning badgegive me an orange checkif you put up 20 bucks once in your lifeyou could give 300 million people anorange checkright nowyou don't have a blue check lex you're afamous person i don't know why you don'thave a blue check have you have you everapplied for a blue check no there are360 000 people on twitter with a bluecheck there are 300 million people ontwitterso the conventional way to verify uhaccountsis elitistarchaic yeah how does it how does itwork how do you get blue check i meanyou go to apply and wait six months andyou have topost you know like three articles in thepublic mainstream media this illustratesyou're a person of interestinteresting generally they would grantthem to ceos of public companies or thewhole idea is to verify that you knowthat you arewho you are who you say you are rightbut the question is why isn't everybodyverified right and there's there's acouple of threads on that one is somepeople don't want to be doxxed they wantto be anonymousbut uh but there are even anonymouspeople that should be verified right umbecause otherwise uh you're you'resubjecting their entire following tophishing attacks and scams and andhostilityuh but the otherthe other what's the orange verificationso the the this idea can you actuallyelaborate a little bit more if you putup 20 bucks yeah i think everybody ontwitter ought to be able to get anorange check if they could come up withlike ten dollars and what is the powerof that orangecheck what what does that verify exactlyyou basically post a security depositfor your safe passage through cyberspaceso the way it would work is if you ifyou've got ten dollars once in your lifeyeah you can basically show that you'recredit worthyand that's your pledge to methat you're going to act responsiblyso you put the 10 of the 20 into thelightning wallet you get an orange checkthen twitter just gives you a settingwhere i can say the only people thatcould dm me are orange checks the onlypeople that can post on my tweets ororange checksso instead of locking out the public andjust letting your followersyou know comment you lock out all theunverified and that means people thatdon't want to post 10 security depositcan't commentonce you've done those two thingsthen uh you're in position to monetizemaliceright monetize motion or malice for thatmatter but let's just say for the sakeof argument you post something and 9 700botsspin up you know and pitch theirwhatever scamright now you sit and you go reportreport report report report report andif you spend an houryou get through half of them you wastean hour of your lifethey just spent up another 97 gazillionbecause they've got a python scriptspending it up so it's hopelessbut on the other hand if you report themand they really are a bot it'stwitter's got a method to actuallydelete the account they know thatthey're botsthe problem is not they don't know howto delete the account the problem isthere are no consequences when theydelete the accountsoif there are consequencestwitter could give they could just seizethe ten dollars or seize the twentydollars because it's a bot it's it's amalicious criminal act or whatever it isa violation of platform rulesyou end up seizing ten thousand dollarsgive half the money to the reporter andhalf the money to the twitter platformand it's a really powerful idea but thatthat's tying it that's adding frictionakin to the kind of friction you havein the physical world you're tying youhave consequences you have realconsequencesconservation of energy conservation ofenergy there's no friction there's nonothing on this earthright i mean you can't walk across theroom without frictionright so that friction is not badright uhunnecessary frictionis badso in this particular case you'reintroducing conservation of energy andin essence you're introducing theconcept of consequence or truthinto cyberspaceand that means if you do want to spin up10 million fakes fake less freedmen'srightsit's going to cost you 100 milliondollars to spend up 10 million fakelexus the thing is you could do thatwith the dollar but your case you'resaying thatit'smoretied to physical reality when you dothat with bitcoinyeah well let's follow up on that idea abit moreif you did do it with the dollarthen the question is how do six billionpeople deposit the dollarsright because what you're doing is yeahcould you do it with a credit card likehow do you send dollars well you have todox yourselflikeit's not easy so you're talking aboutinputting a credit card transactiondoxing yourself and now you've justeliminated the two billion people thatdon't have credit cards or don't havebanks you've also got a problem witheverybody that wants to remain anonymousbut you've also got this other problemwhich iscredit you know credit cards areexpensive transactions low frequencyslow settlementsodo you really want to pay two and a halfpercent every time you actually show a20 deposit and maybe you could do akludgy version of this for a subset ofpeopleit's like it's 10 as good if you did itwithconventional payment rails butwhat you can't dois uh the next idea which isi want the orange badgeto be used to give me safe passagethrough cyberspace tripping across everyplatformso when ihow do i solve the denial of serviceattacks against a website i publish awebsiteyou hit it with a million requestsokay now how do i deal with that well ican lock you out and i can make it axero trust website and then you have tobe coming at me through a trustedfirewall with a trusted credential butthat'sthat's a pretty draconian thingori could put it behind a lightning walla lightning wall would be you know ijust challenge you lex uh you wanna umbrowse my website you have to show meyour hundred thousand satoshi's do youhave a hundred thousand satoshi'sclickokay now you click away a hundred timesor a thousand times and after a thousandtimes you know i'm like well now lexyou're getting offensive over to take asatoshi from you or 10 satoshi's a microtransaction you want to hit me a milliontimes i'm taking all your satoshis andlocking you outwhat you want to do is you want to gothrough 200 websites a dayand what you want every time you crossa domainyou need to be able to in a split secondprove that you've got some asset and nowwhen you cross back when you exit domainyou want to fetch your asset backso how do i in a friction free fashionbrowse through dozens or hundreds ofwebsitespost a security deposit for state safepassage and then get it backyou couldn't afford to pay a credit cardfee each timeit's when you think about two and a halfpercent as a transaction feeit means you trade the money40 timesand it's goneyeah it's gone yeah yeah so you can't dothis kind of hopping around through theinternet with this kind of uhverification that grounds you to aphysical reality it's it's it's a reallyreally interesting idea why haven'thasn't that been donei i think you need uh two things youneed an idea like a digital asset likebitcoin that's a bearer instrument forfinal settlement and then you need ahigh-speed transaction network likelightning where the transaction costmight be a 20th of a pennyor or lessand if you roll the clock back 24 monthsi don't think you haduh the lightning network in a stablepoint it's really just the past 12months it's an idea you could thinkabout this yearand i think you need to you need tobe aware of bitcoin as something otherthan like a scary speculative assetso i really think we're just thebeginning the embryonic stagei have to ask michael saylor you saidbefore there's no second best tobitcoin what would be the second besttraditionally there's ethereum withsmart contracts cardano with proof ofstake polka dot with uhinteroperability between blockchainsdoshcoin hasthe incredible power of the memeuhprivacy with monero i just can keepgoing there's the there's of courseafter theuhblock size warsuh the differentoffshoots of bitcoin i think if you ifyou decompose or segment the cryptomarket you've got crypto propertybitcoin is the king of that you know andother bitcoin forks that want to be anyou know a bearer instrument store ofvalue it would be a property a bitcoincash or a litecoin something like thatthen you've got cryptocurrenciesi don't think i don't think bitcoin's acurrency because uh a currency i definein nation states since a currency is ana digital asset that you can transfer asa you know in a transaction withoutincurring a taxable obligationso that means has to be a stable dollaror a stable euro or a stable yen astable coin so i think you've got cryptocurrencies tether circle most famousthen you've got crypto platforms youknow and ethereum is the most famous ofthe crypto platforms the platform uponwhich you know with smart contractfunctionality etcand then i think you've got just cryptosecurities it's just like my favoritewhatever meme coin and i love it becausei love it and it's attached to my gameor my company or my persona or mywhateveri think if you if you you know pushed meand said well what's the second best iwould say the world wants two things itwants crypto property as a savingsaccount and it wants cryptocurrency as achecking account and that means that thethat the most popular thing really isgoing to be a stable coin dollarright and it's there's a maybe a fightright now might be tether right buta stable dollar because i feel like themarketopportunity it's not clear that there'llbe one that will win the class of stabledollars is probably a one to tentrillion dollar market easilyi think that in the crypto platformspace ethereum will compete with solanaand binance smart chain and and the likeare there certain characteristics of anyof them that kind of stand out to you ordo youdon't you think the competition is basedon a set of featuresalso so the set of features that a thecryptocurrency provides but also thecommunity that it provides does youthink the community matters and sort ofthe adoption the dynamic of the adoptionboth across the developers and theinternet i'm looking at them i mean thefirst question isis uh what's the regulatory risk howlikely is it to be deemed to propertyversus security and the second isis what's the competitive risk and thethird is what's the speed and theperformance and uh and the you know allthose thingsyou know lead to the question of what'sthe security risk how likely is it tocrash and burn and and how stable orunstable is itand then there's the mar you know themarketing risk i mean there aredifferent teams behind each of thesethings and and communities behind themi i think that umthe the big cloud looming over thecrypto industryis regulatory treatment ofcryptocurrencies and regulatorytreatment of crypto securities andcrypto platforms and i think that won'tbe determined until the end of the firstbiden administration for example umthere are people that would like onlyu.s u.s fdicinsured banks to issue cryptocurrenciesthey want jp morgan to issue a cryptodollar backed one-to-onebut then in the us right now we havecircle and we have other companies thatare licensedentities that are backed by cash andcash equivalents but they're not fdicinsured banksthere's also a debate in congress aboutwhether state chartered banks should beable to issue these things and then wehavetether and and others that are outsideof the u.s jurisdictionthey're probably not backed by cash andcash equivalents they're backed by stuffand we don't know what stuffand then finally you haveyou know ust and dye which arealgorithmic stable coinsright that are even uh more innovativefurther outside the compliance frameworkso if you ask who's going to winthe question is reallyi don't know will the market decide orwill the regulators decideif the regulators get out of the way andthe market fought out well then it's aninteresting discussion yeah and then ithink that all bets are off if if theregulators get more heavy-handed withthis and i think you could have the samediscussion with crypto properties likelike the d5 exchanges and the cryptoexchanges the sec would like to regulatethe crypto exchanges they'd like toregulate the d5 exchanges that meansthey may regulate the crypto platformsand and at what rate and in what fashionand so i think thati could give you an opinion if if it waslimited to competition and the currentregulatory regimebuti think that the regulations are are sofast moving and it's so uncertainthat it'sit ityou can't make a decisionwithout consideringuh the potential actions of theregulators i hope the regulators get outof the waycan you steal me on the case thatdogecoin is uh i guess the second bestcryptocurrency or if you don't considerbitcoin a cryptocurrency but instead ofcrypto property i would classify it ascrypto property because the us dollar isa currency so unless your crypto assetis pegged algorithmically or stably tothe value the dollar is not a currencyit's a property or it's an assetso then can you still man the case thatdoshcoin is the best cryptocurrency thenbecause bitcoin is not even in that listthe debate is going to be whether it'sproperty or security and there's adebate whether it's decentralized enoughso let's assume it was decentralized yepwell it's it's increasing at not quitefive what five percent a year inflationrate but it's it's not five percentexponentially it's like a plus fivemillion5 something captain is lessi forget the exact number but it's aninflationary property it's got a lowerinflation ratethan the us dollarand it's got a much lower inflation ratethan than uh many other fiat currenciesso i think you could say that but don'tyou see the power of meme the power ofideas the power ofuh fun or whatever mechanism is used touhcap captivate a community i do but larameme stocks it doesn't absolve you ofyour ethical and securities liabilitiesif you're you know if you're promotingit so like like i i don't have a problemwith like people buying a stockit's just uhthe way i divide the world is rightthere's investment there's savingand there's speculation and there'stradingso bitcoinis an asset for saving if you want tosave money for a hundred years you don'treally want to take on execution riskor the like so you're just buyingsomething to hold forever for for you toactually endorse something as a propertylike if you said to me mike what shouldibuy for the next hundred years i saywell some amount of real estate someamount of scarce collectibles someamount of bitcoin right you can run yourcompanyright but but running your company is aninvestment so the savings are propertiesif you said what should i invest in i'dsay well here's a list of good companiesprivate companies you can start your owncompany that's an investmentright umif you said what should i tradewell i'm trading as like a proprietarything like i'm i don't i don't have anyspecialinsight into that if you're a goodtrader you know you are if you said tome what should you speculate inwe talk about meme stocksand meme coinsand and it's kind of sits up there itsits right in the same space with whathorse should you bet on and what sportsteam should you gamble on and should youbet on black six times in a row anddouble down each timethat's i mean it's fun butat the end of the dayit's uh it's a speculationright you can't build a civilization onspeculation on it it's not aninstitutional asset and in factwhere i leave it right is bitcoin isclearly digital progress which makes itan institutional grade investable assetfor a public company a public figure apublic investor or anybody that's riskadversei think thatthe other the top 100 other cryptos arelike venture capital investments and ifyou're a vc and if you're a qualifiedtechnical investor and you have a poolof capital and you can take that kind ofriskthen you can parse through that and formopinions it's justorders of magnitude more risky becauseof competition because of ambition andbecause of regulationand if you take the meme coins it's likeyou know when some rapper comes out witha meme coin it's likemaybe it'll peak when i hear about itright it's likebut i mean ship was created as a coinsuch that it had so many zeros after thedecimal point that when you looked at iton the exchanges it always showed zerozero zero zeroand it wasn't until like six monthsafter it got popular that they startedexpanding the display so you could seewhether the price had changed that'sspeculationuh you you've beenmaybe you can correct me but you've beencritical of elon musk in the pastin the crypto spacewhere do you stand on elon's effect onbitcoin and cryptocurrency in generalthese daysi believe that bitcoin is a massivebreakthrough for the human race thatwill cure half the problems in the worldand generate hundreds of trillions ofdollars of economic value to thecivilizationand i believe that umit's an early stagewhere many people don't understand itand they're afraid of it and there's fudand there's uncertainty there's doubtand there's fearand there's a very noisy crypto worldand there's 15 000 other cryptos thatare are seeking relevanceand i think most of the fuduh is actually fueled by the othercrypto entrepreneurs so theenvironmental fund and the other typesof of uncertainty that surround bitcoingenerallythey're not coming from legitimateenvironmentalists they don't come fromlegitimate uhcritics they actually are guerrillamarketing campaignsthat are being financed and fueled byother cryptoentrepreneurs because they have aninterest in doing sosoif i look at the constructive pathforwardfirst i think it'd be very constructivefor corporations to embrace bitcoinand and build applications on top of ityou don't you don't need to fix itthere's nothing wrong with it right likewhen you put it on a layer two and alayer three it moves a billion times asecond at the speed of light so everybeautiful cool defy applicationevery crypto application everything youcould imagine you might want to do youcan dowith a legitimate companyand a legitimate website or mobileapplication sitting on top of bitcoin orlightningif you want toso i think that umto the extent that people do that that'sgoing to be better for the worldif you consider what holds people back ithink it's just misperceptionsabout what bitcoin is so i'm a big fanof just uh educating people ifif you're not if you're not going tocommercialize it then just educatepeople on what it is so for examplebitcoin's the most efficientuse of energy in the world by farright most people don't they don'tnecessarily perceive that or realizethat but if you were to take any metricenergy intensityyou put like two billion dollars worthof electricity in the network every yearand it's worth 850 billion dollars thereis no industry in the real worldright that that is that energy efficientnot only that energy efficient it's alsothe most sustainable industry we justwe do surveys 58of bitcoin mining energy is sustainableso there's a very uh good story in factevery other industry planes trainsautomobiles construction food medicineeverything elseit's less cleanless efficientsoso the basic debate would like to iwouldn't say there is a debate i wouldjust say that to the extent that thebitcoin community had any issue withelon it was just you know the just thisenvironmentalyou knowuncertainty that he fueled in a coupleof his tweetsrightuh which i think just is verydistractingwell that was one of them but i thinkit's like the bitcoin maximalist butgenerally the crypto community what youcall the the crypto entrepreneursareyou know it's alsothey're using it fori meanfor investment for speculationand therefore get very passionate aboutpeople's kind of uhcelebrities including you like famouspeople rightum saying positive stuff about any oneparticularcryptothing a thing you can buy in coinbaseand so um they might be unhappy withelon musk that he's promoting bitcoinand then notand promoting dogecoin then notand this kind ofumthere's so much emotion tied up in thecommunication on this topicand that's i think that's where a lot ofthelook i don't havei don't have a criticism of elon muskhe's free to do whatever he wishes to doit's his life in fact elon musk is theyou know the second largest supporter ofbitcoin in the world so i think that thebitcoin community tends to eat its ownquite a bit yeah it tends to be veryuh very self-critical and instead ofsayingwell elon is more supportive of bitcointhan the other 10 000 people in theworld you know with serious amounts ofmoney they like they focus uponyou know yeah this is strangeeating your own is just um so i mean ithink he he's free to do what he wantsto do like and i i i think he's done alot of good for bitcoin in in putting iton the balance sheet of tesla andholding it and i think that sent a verypowerful messagedo you have advice for young people soyou've had a heck of a lifeuh you've done quite a lot of thingsstart before mit but starting with mitis there advice here for young people inhigh school and collegehow toumhave a career they can be proud of howto have a life they can be proud ofi was asked by somebodyfor quick adviceforhis young

partyand then he handed me this sheet ofpaper and i thought oh he wants me towrite it down right now so i i sat downi started writing and i figured whatwould you want to tell someone at age21 you're already done so i wrote itdown and i tweeted it and it's sittingon twitter but i tell you what i said isaidmy advice if you're entering adulthoodfocus your energyguard yourtime train your mindtrain your bodythink for yourselfcurate your friendscurate your environmentkeep your promisesstay cheerful and constructiveand upgrade the worldlike that was the 10. upgrade the worldthat's an interesting choice of wordsupgrade the worldupgrade the worldit's like an engineering energy it's avery yeah it's a very engineeringthemeduh keep your promises too that's aninteresting one i think most peoplesuffer because theythey justthey don't focuslike you got to figure out i think thebig risk in this world is there's toomuch of everything yeahlike you can sit and watch chess videos100 hours a week and you'll never getthrough all the chess videosright there's there's too much of everypossible thing every too much of everygood thing sofiguring outwhat you want to do and theneverything will suck up your time rightthere's a hundred streaming channels tobinge watch on so you gotta guard yourtime and thentrain your body train your mindand control who's around youcontrolwhat surrounds youso ultimately in a world where there'stoo much of everythingthenyou're just laser eyes it's like thoselaser eyes you have to focuson just a few of those thingsyeah i meani got a thousand opinions we could talkabout and i could pursue a thousandthings but i don't expect to besuccessful and i'm not sure that myopinion in any of the 999 is any morevalidthan the leader of thought in that areasohow about if i just focus upon one thingand then uh and then uh deliver the besti can in the one thing that's that's thelaser eye messagethe rest get you distracted well how doyou achieve that do you do you findyourself given where you are in lifehaving to say no a lotor just focus comes naturally when youjust ignore everything around you so howdo you achieve that focusi think it helps if people know whatyou're focused onso you everything about you justradiates that people know people knowthisif they know what you're focused on thenyou won't getso many other things coming your wayif youyou know if you dollyor if you if you flirt with 27 differentthings then you're going to getapproached by people in each of the 27communities rightyou mentionedgetting a phd andgiven your roots at mit do you thinkthere's there's all kinds ofjourneys you can take to educateyourself do you think a phd orschool is still worth itor is there other paths through lifethat is it worth it if you get to payfor it is it worth it to spend the timeon itthe timeand the money is a big cost i i think umtime probably the bigger one right itseems clear to me that the world wantsmore specialistsit wants it wants you to be an expert inand to focus on in one areaand it's punishinguh generalist uh jack of all trades butespecially people that are generalistsin the physical realm because if you'rea specialist in the digital realm youmight very well you're the person with700 000 followers ontwitter and you show them how to tieknotsor you know you're the banjo player youknow with 1.8 million followers and wheneverybody types banjoit's you right yeah and sothe world wants people that that dosomething well and then it wants tostamp out 18millioncopies of themand so that argues in favor of focus nowi mean the definition of a phd is issomeone with enough of an education thatthey're capable of or have made i guessi guess to get a phd technically youhave to have have uh done a dissertationwhere you made a you know a seminalcontribution to the body of humanknowledgeright and and if you haven't done thattechnically you know you have a master'sdegree but you're not a doctorsoif you're interested in any of theacademic disciplinesthat a phd would be granted forthen i can see that being a reasonablepursuit but there are many people thatare specialistsyou knowyou know the agimatoryeah yeah yeahon youtube yeah yeahhe's the world's greatest chesscommentator yeah and i've watched hiscareer and he's got progressively betterand he's really good he's going to lovehearing thisyeah if the agile mate over here is thisi'm a big fan of the agitator i have tocut myself off right because otherwiseyou'll watch the entire paul morphy sagafor your weekendbut uh the point really is youtube isfull of experts who are specialists insomethingand they rise to the top of theirprofession andtwitter is too andthe internet isso ii would advocatethat you figure outwhat you're passionate aboutand what you're good atand you do focus on itespecially ifif the thing that you're doing can beautomatedthe the problem isyou know back to that 500 000 algebrateacher type comment the problem is ifit is possible to be automated then overtime someone's probably going toautomate it andandthat that squeezes you know the statespace of everybody else it's like likeafter the lockdowns it used to be therelike all these local bands that playedin bars and everybody went to the bar tosee the local band and then during thelockdown you would have like these sixsuper groups and they would all get 500000 or a million followers and all thesesmaller local bands just gotno attentionat all well the interesting thing is oneof those 500 000 algebra teachers islikely to be part of the automation soit's like it's an opportunity for you tothinkwhere's myumfield my discipline evolving into italked to a bunch of librarians justhaving to be friends with librarians andthat's libraries will probably beevolving and it's up to you as alibrarian to be one of the ones one ofthe few that remainin the rubbleif you're going to give commentary onshakespeare plays i want you tobasically do it for every shakespeareplay like i want you to be theshakespeare dude because once i oncejust like lex you're likei don't know what kind ofyou're you're the deep thinkingpodcaster right or you're you're theyou're the podcaster that goes after thedeep intellectualconversationsand uh once i get comfortable with youand i like youthen i start binge watching lex yeah butbut if you changed your formatyeah through 16 different formats sothat you could compete with 16 differentother personalities on youtubeyou'd probably wouldn't beat any of themright you would probably just kind ofsink into the you're you're the numbertwo or number three guy you're not thenumber one guy in the format and i thinkthethe the the algorithmright the the twitter algorithm and theyoutube algorithms they really rewardthe person that's focused on messageconsistentthe world wants somebody they can trustthat's consistent and reliableand they they kind of want to know whatthey're getting into becausethis is taken for granted maybe butbutthere's 10 millionpeople vying for every hour of your timeand so the fact that anybody gives youany time at allis a huge is amazing privilege right andyou should be thanking themand and you should respect their timeit's interesting like everything yousaid is very interesting but of coursefrom my perspective and probably fromyour perspectivemy actual life has nothing to do withit's just being focused on stuff and uhin my case it's like focus ondoing the thing i really enjoy doingand being myselfand not caring about anything else likei don't care about views or likes orattentionand that just maintaining that focus isthe way from an individual perspectiveyou live that lifebut yeah it does seem that there'sthe world and technology is rewardingthe specialization and creating biggerand bigger platforms for the differentspecializations andand that yeah and then that lifts allboth actually because thespecializations get better and betterand better at teaching people to dospecific things and they educatethemselves and it's just everybody getsmore and more knowledgeable and more andmore empoweredthe reward for authenticity more thanoffsets the specificity with which youpursue your mission it's like that'strue likeyeah another way to say it is likenobody wants to read advertisinglike if you if you were to spend 100million dollars advertising your thingi probably wouldn't want to watch ityeahbut that's fascinating yeahwe see the death of that yeah and sothat the commercial shows are losingtheir audiences and the authenticspecialists or the authentic artists areare gaining their audienceand that's a beautiful thingspeaking of deep thinking umyou're just a human your life endsyou've uh accumulated so much wisdomso much moneybut the right ends do you think aboutthat do you do you ponder your deathyour mortalityare you afraid of itwhen i go um all my assets will flowinto a foundation and the foundation'smission is to make education free foreverybody foreverandif uh if i'm able to contribute to thecreation ofofa more perfect monetary systemthen maybe that foundation will go onforeverright the ideathe foundation of the idea so not justthe theeach of the foundationsit's not clear we're on the s-curve of amortal life yet like that's a biologicalquestion and you ask that you know onsome of your other interviews a loti think that we are on the threshold ofumof immortal life for ideas or mortallife for certain institutionsor computer programs so if we can fixthe money then you can create uma technically perfected endowmentand thenthe question really is what are yourideas what do you want to leave behindand so if it's a parkthen you endow the park right if it's ifit's free education you endow that ifit'sif it's some otherethical idea right does it make you sadthatthere's something that you'veendowedsome very powerful ideaof digital energy that you put out intothe you helpput it into the worldand your mind your conscious mindwill no longer be there toexperience itit's just gone foreveri'd rather think that the umthe thing that satoshi taught us is youshould do your partduring some phase of the journey andthen you should get out of the wayand yeah i think steve jobs saidsomething similar to that effectin a very very famous speech one daywhich is you know death is a naturalpart of life and it makes way for thenext generationand uh i i thinkthe goal is you upgrade the world rightyou leave it a better place but you getout of the way and uhi think when umwhen that breaks downyou know bad things happeni think nature cleanses itself there's acycle of lifeand speaking one of great people who didalso get out of the way is georgewashington so hopefully when you get outof the way nobody's bleeding you umto death in hope of helping youuhwhat what do you think uh to do a bit ofa callbackwhat do you think is the meaning of thiswhole thing what's the meaning of lifewhy are we here we talked about the riseof human civilization it seems likewe're engineers at heart we'll buildcool stuffbetter and better use of energychanneling energy to be productivewhywhat's it all forthey're getting metaphysical on me verythere's a beautiful boat to the left ofus like why do we do that this this boatthat sailed the oceanthen we build models of it to celebrategreat engineering of the pastto engineer is divineyou can make lots of arguments as whilewe're here we're here we're they're hereto entertain ourselves or we're here toto create somethingthat's beautiful or something that'sfunctional i think if you're an engineeryou entertain yourself by creatingsomething that's both beautiful andfunctionalso i think all three of those thingsit's entertaining butit's ethicalyou know you got to admireyou know the the first person that builta bridgecrossing a chasm orthe first person to work out the problemof how to get running water to a villageor the first person to figure out how toyou knowdam up a riveror mastered agriculture orthe guy that figured out you know how togrow fruit on trees or crated orchardsyou know and maybe one day had like 10fruit trees he's pretty proud of himselfso that's functionalthere is also something to that justlike you said that's justbeautiful it does get you closer toumlike you said the divine somethingwhen you when you step back and look atthe entirety of ita collective of humansusinga beautiful invention or creation orjustjust something about this instrument iscreatinga beautiful piece of musicthat seems just right that's what we'rehere for whatever the divine is it seemslike we're here for that that and i ofcourse love talking to you because uhfrom the engineering perspective thefunctional is ultimately the mechanismtowards the beautyisn't there something beautiful aboutabout making the world a better placefor people that you loveyour friends your familyor yourselfyeahyou knowwhen you think about the the entire arcofhuman existenceand you roll the clock back 500 000years and you think about every struggleof everyone that came before us andeverything they had to overcome in orderto put you here right nowyou knowyou kind ofyou got to admire that right you got torespect thatthat's a heck of a gift they gave usit's alsoa heck of a responsibilitydon't screw it upif i dropped you 500 000 years ago isaid figure out steel refiningor or you knowfakefigure out rate silicon chips fabreproduction or or whatever it is why orfireand so now we're here and i guess theway you repay them is you fix everythingin front of your face you canright that meansto to someone like elon it means get usoff the planetrightto someone like me it's like i thinkyou know fix the energy in in the systemand that gives me hope michael this isan incredible conversation you're anincredible human it's a huge honor youwould sit down with methank you so much for talking todayyeah thanks for having me alexthanks for listening to thisconversation with michael
