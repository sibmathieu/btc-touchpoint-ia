  "text": "we're still up it's been a while whendid we last do one of these I feel likeit's been over a yearno dude it feels long uh it wastechnically last year but uh I believeit was the the Psychedelic series thatwe did and I was in Europe at the time Iremember because I was jumping throughairbnbs with white yeah but that wasthat was me on you on yours right ohyeahoh man okay yeah that's that's in awhile yeah yeah that'sum anyways it's been eventful Lots hashas gone on you've written a book you'vedone a lot of moving around I thinkyou've had some changes in perspectiveor attitudes towards Bitcoin and perhapslife in general soumI think we both thought it was anappropriate time to get back togetherfor a catch-up and and see where thingsare at so I don't know if you had anyplace in particular you wanted to startbefore I crack into some of the things Iwanted to touch onnot necessarily man let's uh I'll letyou guide this conversation well thefirst first of all Kudos on the bookum thank you I have a copy right herethank you really enjoyed itum I can see it having a really positiveimpactwell for a number of reasons but onejust because it's so simple clear andconcise you know and I thought you guysdid a brilliant job in laying thegroundwork First with definitions andall that because as you know today youknow words have lost their meaning andso you're basicallyright so you're establishing what wordsmean before you go on to use them in thebook so there's no ambiguity which isgreatum and it's just you know it'sit's the type of simple almost CommonSense thinking at least you know topeople like you and I that is souncommon today and uh I think it willreally help peopleuh rebut a lot of the [ __ ]collectivists communist sort ofphilosophy and thinking that is runningrampant today so Kudos on putting thattogetherum what was the what was the processlike of writing the book I knew I knowyou and Mark did a kind of a book Sprintwhich is kind of mind-blowing becauseagain it is like even though it's shortthe quality of the writing is I thinkvery good uh so what was that like andwhat has the the feedback or responsebeenyeah so theyou were in Salvador right when um wewere there in June or July yeah sort ofjust when there's a big group of us withMark and yeahumyeahRicky Williams yeah that's right yeahyeah I thought so I was trying to like Iwas trying to think in my head I'm likeam I hallucinating was John there prettysure you werethat was that was actually where theidea popped up so I think Mike and Iwere having lunch and he just said haveyou read the sorry he said have youheard the Communist Manifesto and I justsaidwhy why the [ __ ] would I do thatum he said it's really bad I'm just sureI'm sure it is bro all right yeah yeahbut you tell me you know I read thatjust to butt in before you go on I readthat um like 20 years ago just because Iwanted to expose myself to all thephilosophies and economic theories andstuff like thatum and I kind of forgot about it and Iguess I wasn't primed to really assessit properly or judge it but I read itbecause I was reading this and I wantedto you know know what you guys weretalking aboutI can't I cannot believe that that bookand that way of thinking and the pointsmade in that bookare what has motivated or oriented somany people's economic and politicalphilosophy since it was written it is soawful there are like it's so poorlyargued there's holes all over it it it'slogically inconsistent in many places Imean I can'tI can't believe it it's it's been soinfluentialyou know it's mind-boggling man when Ilike when mock mentioned that in in Julyof 20 I guess that was 2021 rightand you know the sort of the idea justsaid in the back of my heads for a whileand you know I had a big change uh in mypersonal circumstances in um in Decemberof 2021 or sort of December January so Ijust hit markup in January I said heydudeyou want to write this book I said I'llhave some time in January let's gettogether so we we jumped uh into anAirbnb in Austin and just sort of hit itand and in the sort of week proceeding Idid the same thing I sat down read thebook I thought what in God's name did Ijust readum yeah I read it again thinking thatmaybe I'm being too judgmental I waslike no this is really bad like the asyou said logical inconsistencies poordefinitions like he he kind of likepaints people he doesn't like you knowwith a particular brush and then justmakes a bunch of assumptions of peoplehe doesn't like nor interact with uhwith a further set of assumptions I'mlike Jesus Christ so I when I firststarted putting notes together I wasjust basically doing rebuttals to eachof his pointsand anyway Mark and I got together we'relike okay so what are we actually gonnawrite here is it going to be like arebuttal to the book you know this andthat and we didn't actually have adirection initially the the book sort ofI don't know it was kind of likeorganically kind of popped up we justsaid all right how about we try and youknow let's try and emulate the the styleand the length of the book becauseclearly something about the length seemsto have maybe contributed to its youknow success and and there is somethingto be said about a short concise bookyou know the the law and anatomy of thestate being sort of two on The Logicalend of the spectrum that have done thathave done quite well right and so we satdown we kind of split the chapters up uhI think I took one in three Mark tooktwo and four and we just started likeletting the ideas flow and we kind ofyou'll notice obviously throughout thebook there's some sentence structuresthat we kind of took remarks like youknow the opening of chapterum one for example the the structure ofchapter two where we kind of talk aboutcrony capitalism and all the you knowthe false forms of capitalism he does asimilar thing about socialism andcommunismand then in chapter three is obviouslythe the ten points and we we sort ofdissected those and made our own 10points that we thought were were more ummore prescriptive for for a morefunctional Society so so we did that butreally the book kind of organicallyemerged and we we got obviously 80 of itdone during that book Sprint and then Iplayed editor later which is why I thinkthere is like a couple spelling mistakesthroughout but anyway my bad I'm not aneditorum and yeah I spent a couple weeks justsort of going through it refiningediting refining editing and thenyeah we we decided to publish ourselvesand what was that process like you knowbecause most people have never publisheda book so what was it like getting itprinted getting it listed I assume it'skind of easy for Amazon but like do youhave to work with Distributors to get itsent out elsewhereand then what was the response because Iknow I mean on Amazon the reviews areoutstanding right you have a lot ofreally positive reviews so you know whatwas the feedback how did it sell whatwas the publishing like Enlightenmentyeah so let's let's start with theprocess so thethe process was not as difficult as Ithought it would be like I wasn't surelike you know how do you published abook who do you go to so we ended upgoing with England spark for example andthey they did a great job they printedthe first round of books um we you knowyou obviously get your price breaksright so we ordered a bunch and I thinkwe overshot the mark initially like weordered we ordered something like 2 000books to sell at umat the Bitcoin conference as like sortof pre-sale pre-launch and that was adumb ass move because I don't know Ithought we sold a good chunk we soldfive six hundred right like but wedidn't do the math right because Ithought like the way we did the math wasokay there's gonna be 30 000 peoplethere I'm sure we'll sell you know acouple thousand books but you know youget like two signing Slots of 60 Minuteslike how do you physically sign 2 000books in 60 minutes like even if yousigned five books a minute which ispretty you know on point that's 300books maximum in that space of time sowe yeah I [ __ ] that up and but but youknow what we we actually I think soother than safety and safety anddefinitely sold more books than we didum he sold the most out of everybodylike we were by far the second most soldbook um and then sort of everybody elseI think sold on average like between 30to 50 books so it was sort of an orderof magnitude more so that it was good itdid well uh we obviously did aKickstarter as well and then we sort ofused the excess books to fulfill thatthat was a little bit complicatedbecause you know we had to mark an hourin different cities so we had to signboth the books and that was a [ __ ]nightmare because we had to get in thesame city sign the books and everythingso I realized doing a Kickstarter andoffering a signed tier like definitelyneeds to be charged way higher becauseit's just and then actually shippingthose books because when you sign anddedicate like you're not just sending asigned copy a sign you've got to makesure that one goes to that person sowhen we had to send it to theFulfillment company we had to get aFulfillment company to get them all outthat was a [ __ ] pain in the assbecause I had to sit there and tag andlabel each book and then bundle themtogether to say all right this pack ofbooks goes to this person and there wasa lot of manual work in it I think ittook me likethree days locked up in the room tryingto sort of dedicate each one and signhim and tag him and you know put it inthe spreadsheet so that way it goes tothe right person everything but anywaywe learned a lot from the processum and it was good like the crowdfundwas great the you know we smashed thegoal we set out to raise six grand Ithink we did over 20 and so that was youknow that was really good and um andyeah and then we just you know keptpumping it on podcasts and stuff I meanfor the last I don't know we we kind ofthe podcast died off in Augustum so the book I think officiallylaunched in August on Amazonum and we just sort of did podcastscoming up into that and the last bigpodcast we did was obviously with AlexJones uh in August that was sort of okayI forgot about it yeah that was yeahthat was hilarious and um and I meanthat that spiked our sales like and Ihope that the book acted as an orangepill for um for people reading itbecause we obviously I mean that's theone thing that I think is special aboutthis book is that it's it's a Bitcoinbook but it's not a Bitcoin book rightlike it sets the stage for thatwe only had one short section aboutBitcoin in there and it was it wassuccinct it laid the case for whyBitcoin not you know nothing technicalnothing overly you know fancy orconfusing or anything just laid the casefor why you need better money and whybitcoin's better money and why it's theonly form of uh digital money that sortof you know fulfills that promise and Ithinkyou know it's it's probably done a goodenough job likeyou know so sort of to track back sinceAugust we haven't done much marketing orpromotion or anything like you knowthere's still some sales going throughand you know what I've learned is thatif you're going to be an author youreally need to continue pumping anddoing podcasts and doing appearances andall that sort of stuffum to make sure that peopleyou know get access to it butyeah the the overall feedback has beenfantastic I mean I've only seen two badcomments and one was from a guy thatsaidyou knowcommunism is the worst thing that everhappened in the world you know youidiots are writing about and I'm likebro we wrote a book against communismlike so I don't think you read the bookit was just one of those like unverifiedreview scroll a review troll orsomething like that basically what the[ __ ]um so I was like thanks for your onestar review dum dum and you know despiteagreeing and then there was someone elselike I think calling Mark a scammer orsomething like that whatever and thenbut that's it like other than that likeother than two trolls we've had likegreat feedbackand yeah it's uh it's done really well Ithink how muchdoes an author make on a book you knowyou always hear like well if it retailsfor 20 they make like two or somethinglike that I mean what's the realitylike we we're sort of making I thinkfive bucks a book and we split itbetween us so like and it retails forfor whatI think like 13 bucks or somethingthat's not badyeah I mean but that's because we don'thave a publisher right to self-publishthis you'll make you'll make the marginthere umdoes it get distributed to like physicalbookstores throughout the world or is itonly on Amazon it's only on Amazon yeahhow many have you soldjust out of curiosityI mean if you count the pre-sales andthe um and thethe kickstarter and all that sort ofstuff you know maybe we're at 10K Ithink that's great man you know it's notbad yeah I think it's [ __ ] awesomeselling 10 000 books you know and Iagree with your point that um and I Imean I don't know if this is there'sgoing to be a lot of books like that inthe future it's certainly the case withwhat I'm trying to write butif you do a good enough jobyou know uh explicating the context ofof what you're talking about and theimportance of the forthcoming solution Idon't think you have this I mean itdepends of course what angle you'retaking but you may not have to spend toomuch time on you know uh talking aboutthe solution in this case Bitcoin rightso you kind of like lay out what theproblem is and then you basically justsay like there appears to be an emergingsolution to this or at least somethingthat's going to dramatically amelioratethe circumstance that keeps allowingthis thinking and these systems to recurand um of course right because if youjust try to pitch someone Bitcoin andthey have no they're not primedwhatsoever to understand why somethinglike that is even necessary like you cango on and on about 21 million and youknow lightning that work and whateverwhatever else but they that that'smeaningless to them because they haven'tappreciated the importance of that theyhaven't appreciated the utility thenecessity the implications all that kindof stuff so if you do that groundworkfirst thenI think serving up the solution is a loteasier and you don't have to be asforceful with your you know yourargumentation or your persuasion and Iso I thinkbooks like that probably will be apretty strong force for orange pillingbecause it's not Bitcoin in your facethe whole time it's here's a problemthat pretty much everyone can relate toto some degree if you're at all likenon-clown World person you know uh andthen you're just saying look there's alot of people propose a lot of differentsolutions this is the one that seems tobe the most logical in terms of the inline with the logic we've usedthroughout this book and then of courseit's up to everyone to think you knowhow much it makes sense to them and howmuch they want to pursue a greaterunderstanding but I I think it's I thinkit's awesome I think you guys did agreat job thank you I think that's sortof what you're talking about therereminds me of sales andentrepreneurialism which is you knowmore my background than writing likeI've just sort of stumbled into writingjust being a Bitcoin all right which weall seem to or a lot of us seem to havedone but when I sort of look at itthrough the lens of uh of being anentrepreneur andselling something is the classic Simoncynic thing it start with Y right likeyou have to start there and that and Ithink I grasped that early on aboutBitcoin you know which is sort of one ofmy early early early pieces like beforeI was a proper Bitcoin Maxi before I wason Twitter or anything like that was Ithink I wrote um you know Homo sapiensyou know Evolution something Bitcoinright like money and Bitcoin and thenthe idea was like you know go backthroughout history and you know this hassort of been rehashed a million timesnow in the Bitcoin space you knowhistory of money where we came from whywe needed blah blah but that thatargument like still to this day Remainsthe most important one is you need toestablish why and I think what we didhere is we didn't take that angleobviously the history of money angle wejust looked atyou know what is wrong with collectivismuh you know what is wrong withpoliticking what is like I think one ofmy favorite things about the book wasthe the capitalism component which ishey let's let's define what capital isall right so if capital is time energyand scarce resources so sort of yourbase layer Capital you know you couldargue second layer capital is you knowreputation ideas you know things likethat you know and then so what'scapitalism well hey it's the effectiveand efficient use of that stuff andhow's that not a good thing and how isthat not something that human beingshave done since the beginning of time sotherefore like capitalism isn't politicsit's it's a process and if you sort oflook at things from that lens the thewhole argument shifts it's no longerabout communism versus capitalism it'sabout politics versus you know organiceconomics it's politics versus you knowhuman cooperation uh it's politicsversus productivityum and then you know when when we've gotSpectrum in there that's sort of placedon its side and I think that they'resort of prettypowerful insights and I know you knowthat sort of stuff it's essentially arehash of what the great Austrianeconomists have discussed for years butI guess the difference is is this isdigestible in 80 Pages versus you knowyou can take human action on ThousandPages good luck if you get through ityou know yeah well case in point I Inever could get through Human Action youlike I Tried reading the book I triedthe audiobook and I just I couldn't getthereum and you know even everything needs tobe rehashed if for no other reason Imean history is littered with the sameideas whether it's in the realm ofphilosophy or theology or economics oranything but they have to berecapitulated for the time and thecontext and the culture that they'rethat they are once again relevant withinyou know you we we who have a greatergrasp of how to communicate to our peersin this time and place need to takethose ideas that have lost theirsalience because they use a differentlanguage and they use different emphasisand they're you know whatever and wehave to extract the Insight or thewisdom or the the primary theme truthwhateverand explain it again in terms that havea greater salience for our time andplace and so I think it's a tremendous Imean it's notI mean it's a tremendous service butit's it's nothing to be looked down uponbecause it's it's equivalent tocoming up with those Concepts yourselfinsofar as if you didn't they wouldn'tbe available for many for many otherpeople to consider and thereforeintegrate into their own perspective andbenefit from so I think it's atremendous service I want to read one uhbecause you mentioneddefinitions and you single thoughcapitalism it's one of my favoritedefinitions in the book but uh it saysminus all the definitions projected onit capitalism is just a natural processof taking resources time energy matterand turning them into something ofhigher order value it's forcingfunctions are efficiency andEffectiveness it's corrective mechanismis loss and it's positive feedback loopis growthyou know it's like that cuts through somuch of the [ __ ]um mudslinging and and you knowyou know what people get on with todayand their critiques of capitalism that'sjust a very like it is it's very simpleit is the way it is you can't reallyargue with anything here now of coursethey will because a lot of people are soideologically possessed that they justcan't help it but I just love how thebook it didn't have a lot of fat on it Iguess is one way of putting it you knowyou guys didn't try to grind too much ofan ideological ax despite the the nameof the the book you just tried to be asobjective as possible and put forwardobjective logic in the realm of you knoweconomics individualism politics to somedegreethanks Ben yeah I think um I'm I amactuallyI'm prettyproud I guess of you know how it cameout so what was the Alex Jonesexperience like[Laughter]hilarious we're umwe were in there and I mean obviously hedidn't have a chance to read it he wasbusy with his own book about you knowwhatever the hell he's writing about nowand um anyway like they budget us tocome in there early and man I was likemoving house that day it was you knowthree days after my wedding like it was[ __ ] pandemonium I was dropping mywife off at the [ __ ] airport likeeverything was happening that dayand uh and then it [ __ ] stormed likea rare Austin storm like the roads wereflooding and everything so anywayfinally make it to this place and he'slike all right we're running an hour anda half late and I was like you've got tobe [ __ ] kidding me bro I'm gonna killyouum so anyway the place was like a bunkerumand yeah sort of hour and a half twohours later we umwe got on and we did it you know therewas some good questions back and forthand then kind of three quarters of theway through the uh interviewhe looks at his like all right gentlemenuh I'm gonna go have a nap you guys canfinish the showand like this is sort of mid mid [ __ ]like because so every you know 10 15minutes he takes like a couple minutebreak like to sort of break up his uhhis show and then you know Mark and Ijust look at each other likewhat the [ __ ] and he's like you'll befine you know he gets up and walks the[ __ ] offI'm just kind of serious like all rightso you know watching the the countdowntime down like you know two minutes oneminute Etc and we're kind of liketalking back and forth okay what are wegonna do what are we gonna say andactually if you go back and listen tothe episode you'll you'll see like umwhen the final ad roll finishes youactually hear us going like okay youready all right let's let's do this Iwas like all right and we're back andit's like we sort of take on the showhit the last 10 15 minutes whatever itwas and um yeah it was an experience Ibet what was Alex like off camera if youhad any FaceTimecrazy man he was warm like yeah no he'sreally warm um you know sort offlustered all over the placeum built like a [ __ ] French Bulldogum yeah my my sister was there so shegot to meet him and yeah that was funnywe you know we we had a bit of aconversationum so yeah we hung out afterwards for alittle bit but um yeah I think good guybig heartum you knowokay nobody's perfect obviously he's gothis own sort of problems to deal withand everything like that I think he wasgone he was right in the middle of likethe Sandy Hook stuff which I didn't evenknow anything to do with Sandy Hook waslike I had no idea I just heard thatword floating aroundum so yeah he was a bit all over theplace with his new book and he wastrying to he had sold something like youknow 20 000 copiesum on on sort of directly through his uhplatform and he was trying to sign 20000 copies of the book and I'm likeum so yeah it was yeah I think it was aunique experience didn't I bet didn't heumdidn't they um I don't know how tophrase this wasn't like the uh thepenalty against him in that case like abillion dollars or something like thator something somehow yeah God knows whatthe [ __ ] like they just like slungwhatever they could sling at him and Idon't know if he had to go bankrupt orwhatever but anyway what a what a [ __ ]storm basically I mean look whateveryour views are on the guy you got tohand it to him for being able to likejustput up with the onslaught of attacksthat have been levied at him for youknow the last however many years 30 40years you know and some some morelegitimate than others but I mean hekeeps going he's convicted in somethinghe does and there's that and just thefunny thing is like as much as he's anut like I mean the fact that 50 of thestuff that he said actually came out tobe true is just well that helps you knowa lot not only not only credit to himbut also just uh you knowjust funny that that's the world we livein that you know Alex Jones was actuallyright like the fact that that's the casejust sort of shows you how far go in theworld actually is yeah totallyum I also read well I read some of thestuff you sent me which you know forworking on your forthcoming book whichuh we can either discuss now or someother time but I also read yourum it was the same kind of point or atleast one of the points you made wassimilar to a piece I think he wrote wasit December 2022 it's kind of like ayear in reviewof uh the year in Bitcoin something likethat yeah yeah yeah yeahor mate yeah and you put something outlast week I'm getting them all mixed upbut I read them all is the point and uhit seems that yoursomewhere along lines you had a fairlysignificant change in perspective onthings both in terms ofyour view of how Bitcoin is going todevelop or play out you know how thishow this whole thing plays out but alsoyou know your way of approaching andshowing up to whatever it is you want tocall your role in this thing you know aa writer a speaker a podcaster ayou know whatever whatever you areumand uh you know I think it's notuncommon for Bear markets to facilitatethese kind ofself-reflection these times ofself-reflection where you kind of allthe hoopla kind of gets quieted down andall the distractions get quieted downand you stop you stop thinking about youknow all the things you're going to havewith the lifestyle you're going to haveand you know things get really quiet andyou get quiet with yourself and you haveto you're whether or not you have to ornot but you're given a lot of time youhave a lot of time to think what do Ireally want to be doing here what'sactually meaningful to me you knowself-assessment basically and so itseems like that process has engenderedsome change in use so maybe you canshare with me what um how and why you'vechangedyeah man there's a i2022 was a rough year for me sort ofbear Market aside obviously that didn'thelpum I had some interesting things from afrom a personal sort of Life standpointum I think mymy propensity to you know speak beforethinkingum kind ofyou know it helped develop an onlinepersona for me that you know peopleexpected you know the toxic one you knowlike sort of all that sort of stuff andyou know I I leaned into that andyeahI ended up you know with my position oncovid and politics and stuff like thatityou know it put it put in danger thebusiness that I'd spent yearsum building basically and sort of thatthat sort of came to a head at the endof uh 2021 and you know without goinginto detail sort of Iyou know put put theit I was no longer able to be the headof basically the business that I foundit um and and that was like you know bigbig big shift to me because you know asmuch as people know me more as a writeror you know or a Twitter personalitylike I've always been an entrepreneurI've built businesses built teams builtproductsum you know some successful some not sosuccessful like you know there's onethat a bunch of people know me fromwhich I was on Shark Tank for uh back inyou know 20 2015 2016 but it was it wasa cool app we built a recruitmentautomation app and the whole point waswe were building um personalityprofiling for people and trying to kindof like throw a Tinder interface matchpeople to roles based on who they arenot just the skills that they haveum but you know it was the first time Iever raised Capital you know I was youngfirst time I was ever building like areal tech product myself and alsoraising capital in Australia is a[ __ ] [ __ ] show like it's it's notAmerica and that's why you you have likethree unicorns that came out ofAustralia and they're all dead-basedproducts you knowumso it's not like you know there weresome there was definitely somechallenges and you know it was abusiness that failed but I spent twoyears building that uh taking no salaryand putting all my savings in thatum you know and we we didn't succeed inthe end and there was a there was ashark tank appearance of me which justlooked really [ __ ] bad when youwatched the show because uh like man itwas it was funny sothis is a bit of a tangent I don't knowif you want me to go into it yeah butbefore it was it was hilarious so I Iwas in there for like an hour andsomething like hour and 10 minutes orwhateverum and I actually knew one of the one ofthe Shark Tank guys he was a venturecapitalist guy running an acceleratorout of Brisbane just up the roadand um and anyway like I thought SharkTank would be a great great way for usto get some publicity uh we had alreadyraised some money at a particularvaluation and you know we just went inthere for the publicity and to top upso beforehandum I'm speaking with the the umthe lady that sort of organizing the dayand everything and she's like all rightso we pre-record the entry in the exitand you know we want to get you sayingsomething spicy so how about likefeel like a shark going into the SharkTank and I'm like okay you know and soso we scripted this stupid thing for meto say and me like a dumbass rightthinking that you know this is gonna becool I'm going on TV you know I said allthis like arrogant sounding [ __ ] so likeI got [ __ ] served up and you know Iwalk into this place and you know ofcourse when I walk in like you gotta yougotta walk in you gotta stand there andlike look at the judgesum and then they [ __ ] up somethingwith the cameras so they're like up cutall right send him back out so like Ihad to do the whole [ __ ] walk thingagain so it was like started off likesuper awkward sounds horrible dude itwas it was a [ __ ] show and then you knowwe get into this thing so I liketalk through what I'm doing blah blahblah you know the idea is interestingum and then I start you know getting thequestions and as I'm trying to answerquestions like the next one [ __ ] Cutsin so I'm halfway through answering aquestion the next judge you know shockuh Cuts in and the next one Cuts in thenext one Cuts in and you know there wastwo of them that were just asking thedumbest possible questions like the ladyin the [ __ ] red dressum whatever her name is uh that doeslike her claim to fame in business isthat she built uh you know a dealswebsite or whateverum asking me just like these dumbquestions I was like you gotta be[ __ ] kidding me and then the guy thatI knew the the venture capitalist dudefrom Brisbane who like I saw himbackstage he's like oh Alex good to seeyou blah blah he went straight into likehis show mode and he's the character onthe Shark Tank that's the [ __ ] rightand so he just started sort of guy butbasically and and I'm like sitting herethinking [ __ ] you were justbeing nice to me you know five minutesago like now you're like being a [ __ ] soI was like uh man and it started Dawningon me you know you know where thisconversation was going so then it justgot heated and basically obviously theydidn't investum and then I didn't see anything fromShark Tank because the um Channel 10which is the company that you know runsShark Tank actually went bankruptum funnily enough uh from the great youknow operation of the business and youknow they they almost came the show butthen like a year later or something likethat it came outand you know what came out was like the18 minute cut right so they cut out allthe potsum and they just made me look like anabsolute [ __ ] monkey like I look likethis arrogant [ __ ] that came intrying to raise at a you know bigvaluation you know we only needed anextra 200 grandum and we had raised at a eight milvalve or something so the percentageslike looked really bad so we were askingfor 200 grand for something like twopercent or something you know it soundedlike really bad and anywayum that was sort ofuh yeah that experienceum and I learned a lot from thatexperience but anyway I think the reasonIwhy did I mention that in the firstplace yeah my history is entrepreneurialso and I have made mistakes and um hadyou know some successes and some blowups butthat's lifeum so anyway fast forward to 2022 sohad this experienceum you know butted heads with you knowthe Australian regulators and thegovernment and everything like that so Ihad to step away from that and then hadthis sort of identity crisis in 2022like what the [ __ ] am I doing withmyself I've always been an entrepreneurI've always built businesses I can'teven [ __ ] run my own company nowum what do I doand you know obviously the book was sortof one area to ventum you know I did some stuff with theBitcoin times you know which we can havea chat about butum I think you know what ended uphappening was I was just like frustratedfrustrated with umclown World frustrated with you knownomadding for three or four years andyou know masked Nazis and all that sortof crap you know frustrated with thewhole business situation you knowfrustrated with you know we're trying tofigure out how to get visas and tryingto you know figure out a place to stayin the amount of you know bending overand you know stupidity that you had togo through for that and it it certainlycame out in Twitter I think you know my2022 Twitter was basically the way Ikind of framed it in that article that Idid you know at the end of 2022 or earlyor in January this year or whatever isthat I was kind of like a a young dudepissed off at the world you knowfrustrated that I can't you know changeitum and a lot of that anger sort of cameout in my my online Persona and I thinkpeople got the impression thatI was just a [ __ ]um that had nothing nice to say aboutanything and um and yeah so that sort ofdawned on me you know in December ofthis year oh sorry of last year I sortof sat down I was like man what do Iwant I've put so much like energy andeffort like out into the world I'vepainted a Target on my backum you knowmade myself a sacrificial goat you knowI've been [ __ ] arrested on fourairplanes for not wearing them I waslike all this sort of [ __ ] for what whatdo I have to show for it like I actuallywent backwards financially I wentbackwards in every [ __ ] Dimensionthat actually mattersum other than obviously my myrelationship and I was like [ __ ] this[ __ ] [ __ ] Twitter [ __ ] you know thewhole toxic thing [ __ ] the wholeum you know putting my neck out and youknow saying all this crapum you know like I just don't careanymore soum yeah I decided to just sort of goback to what originally got me attentionon Twitter which was like thoughtprovoking writingum and ideas and you know sort of moreeducationally orientedum and focus more on my my personal lifemy health my my own finances you knowI'm working on a new startup at themoment so like yeah justkind of In My Own Lane I just reallydon't give a [ __ ] about the world andabout you know all the the sort of thethe labels and the communities and thewhatever the [ __ ] else is going oncouldn't give a [ __ ] like yeah so it's abig change in that and it's been it'sbeen fantastic yeah I mean I a lot ofthat resonates with me you know I'vebeen increasing more and more quiet onon Twitter I mean now that nostril haspopped upit's just a it's just a better Vibe so Ifind myself enjoying engaging there moreand um you know so so that's a littlebit different but I would always youknow I'd I'd be about to send out atweet and then I'd be like this is thisjust seems like a cheap low hangingfruit shot like of course the world issuper [ __ ] up and of course there's aton of [ __ ] people doing [ __ ]things everywhereis that worth is that how I see myselfas just another one in the chorus thatpoints that out and goes haha you guysare [ __ ] morons uh and I like I don'twant to be that person that's not megetting the most out of myself that'snot me directing my attention to what'smost meaningful that's not meamplifying or building or contributingto what's more most meaningful orbeautiful or truthful or whatever and soI would I find myself like being almostthere and then be like no that's thatthat's the wrong to use kind of awoo-woo language but that's the wrongenergy right I don't want to be in thatand umyou know and so you and basically if youdon't haveit's not it's not the old saying fromyour mom like if you don't havesomething nice to say don't say anythingat all but for me it was like if I don'thave anything constructive or positiveor you know creative to say why justbe another one in the chorus calling outclown world and the flip side of that isthere is utility in the people that dothat because that content reaches peoplethat go oh really I hadn't thought of itthat way before Oh I didn't realizethings were so absurd and that caninstigate their own Journey on learninghow crazy things are and changing theirperspective taking the red pill takingthe orange pill and on it goes butI just felt for myself like that'sthat's not my game I I want to beinvolved in things that are just morepositive more constructive moremeaningful to me and if you know ifthere's an audience for that if peopleappreciate it or value it then wonderfuland if they don't then that's fine tooyou know I don'tI mean I never did anything for like thenumbers or the engagements or anythinglike that but but as you said likeespecially over the coveted yearsthere's so much frustration that justbuilds up like part of coping with it isthose like flare routes yeah exactlyyou're just venting you just point youknow you're you can't help but but pointout how crazy things are just so peopleknow you see it and and you know youit's a helpless cry basically because itdoesn't really do much but again you'reventing you're coping in some wayum and it's totally really I think a lotof us can understand it because it wassuch a crazy time and in many cases youknow although that particularcircumstance haswaned a little bitum you know there's still a ton of stuffworthy of being frustrated and outragedabout in in clown world but again liketo what to you know for to what ends andto what cost as well and I think wewould all agree likewe've all been down that road of ofdoing thatand as you said I mean where does itleave you probably not where you want tobe and not even in the direction thatyou want to go but if you focus onthings that are meaningful and if youfocus onum you know winning in however youconstrue that uh then that's got to be abetter use of time and I thinkthe I think a lot of us are figuringthat out and the last thing I'll sayabout that is in your most recent piecethat's the one where you you saidbasically Bitcoin adoption is going tohappen more slowly than people thinkright yeah yeahum and this is something that we'vetalked about before I focus on a lotthe process of being subject to orcontributing to or engaging in aparadigm shift of this scale is thatconstant like grinding Forge of changethat you have both subjected to yourselfvoluntarily and in many ways areexperiencing on a subconscious level andso like I feel like these sort of upsand downs theseumyou know these periods ofself-reflection where you end up havinga fairly substantial change in yourperspective and how you Orient yourselfand the things you're working towards Ithink that's just power for the courseand probably will be for a long timebecause we are coming from you and I andour generation we're conditioned in likethe height of Fiat like we are productsof Fiat culture and we managed to stickour head up out of the pulpit and likelook at the you know the blue sky or seethrough it but it doesn't mean we'rewe can just shake off all theconditioning that we've been subjectedto and that we've you know taken onboard and used to construct our ourpersonality and our perspective and ourbeliefs and our philosophies that's a amuch slower process and it takesengaging the world to figure out whatways in which we need to change that tobe most fruitful or most conducive tothe things that are that we want toachieve are most meaningful to us so Ithink as this process that you laid outin that pieceuh takes place now who knows if you'reright with the the periods but let'sjust say that it's we're obviously in aprocess of some kind and I do think thatand the Utah most of the people I talkto on this podcast these days are justrandom bitcoiners out in the wild andthe reason why I do it is because I Ilove to hear those stories I love tohear peoplewhatever background whatever they weredealing withthe more they go down the rabbit holethe more the more they find themselveslike forging a new persona forging a newidentity and one that they deem to befar moreyou know competent and positive andhopeful and constructive and strong andcourageous and all the virtues that wewould probably deem well all the virtuesthat we would probably agree on theseare the things that they're using toreconstruct an identity and it's and andthis process that they've put themselvesin I.E you know adopting Bitcoin and theglobal adoption of Bitcoinum seems to be the the primary Catalystfor that and so um I thinkI mean one I think it's great that youhave theyou know the strength of the courage orthe humility to say like that you havechanged your perspective on things andyou you look back on some of yourbehavior and you think perhaps it wasn'tyou know the most productiveuh or the best use of your time becauseI think a lot of people right now areprobably feeling a similar way you knowthere's a a lot of frustration and a lotof [ __ ] and a lot of excitement anda lot of hoopla and just that toxic mixof all thatwithin a Fiat system and within a Fiatmentalityit's gonna it's gonna throw you offcourse a little bit I would sayum and I I think uh a lot of people asfar as I can tell are going through thisprocess of reflecting now and being likewhat is the thing that I want well whodo I want to be and what is the thing Iwant to focus on most with my limitedtime and resources and how like and therest I just want to cut out I want tocut out the noise I want to you know Idon't want to engage in in all the clownWorld stuff I don't want to waste mytime scrolling on Twitter and seeing allthe videos that are so super crazy likewhy what is that doing for me and so Iyou know I think a lot of people areexperiencing that right now it's funny Istarted like unfollowing and muting alot of that stuff because sort of youknow my My Philosophy obviously was umyou know in the beginning kind of RageAgainst the Machine so sort of 2020 and21 was Rebel uh 2022 kind of morphedinto and I actively was one of thepeople saying this is like Now's theTime We ridicule these idiots intoOblivion right and just ridicule regularand you sort of sort of saw the rise ofthe clown World accounts and all thatsort of stuff and we did like weeffectively won the war throughridiculing the [ __ ] out of all thestupidityum you know we won the me moreeffectivelyum but sort of you know the strategy nowfor me at least um I don't know aboutothers but for me it's kind of turnedinto just ignore now now it's like themove on stage and you know the theridiculing the problem with ridiculingis that it can get nasty it can get meanum and and for me kind of I I feel likea lot of the umyou know I I really tried tosay the right thing and the thing iseven though I was ridiculing even thoughI was toxic and everything I was rightabout everything I said like I was oneof the earliest ones to point out thecovert stupidity you know like a lot ofthe things I said were right but youknow maybe the the way I said them wasyou know abrasive or toxic orprovocative or whatever rightum and you know you do that because oneout of frustration and two becausesometimes you just need to [ __ ] Shakepeople to say like no like this this iswhat it is I mean it just sort of shotpeople into uminto looking at something but when Ilook back on it and say all right so Istuck my neck out you know I said allthese things you know I made myself aTarget you know I painted it you knowpainted a big red [ __ ] thing on mybackum you know being a public figureum what did I get for it like you knowtowards the end of 2022 I had Bitcoin istelling me that uh I'm a scammer thatI'm a [ __ ] you knowuh what is it like uh you know a fakebitcoiner because like I lost the youknow debate to Richard Hart or whateverI was like you got to be [ __ ] kiddingme like sort of like all of the [ __ ]that I put myself out for like I got abunch of like [ __ ] hate from even inthe Bitcoin Community I was like youknow what [ __ ] this like it's just it'snot worth it it's not worth the energyit's not worth the um the time and thatwas sort of you know at least to somedegree I'm thankful for that becausethat sort of pushed me away fromuhit it kind of you know maybe in a way itactually was my Catalyst to to sort ofdrop the the ridicule stage and changemy strategy to ignorance stage becausenow I'm just not interested and as yousaid likewhen when you when you do that and youmove away from the noiseum and you you cut that out like life isso much more peaceful like I got I justblocked a shitload of peopleum you know I just like cut that out ofmy [ __ ] mental system like I exited abunch of telegram groups like all thatsort of stuff like I just cleaned up ina felt so [ __ ] good man I can't eventell you like you know there was Iremember there was this one dude liketrying toyou know I've got like a bunch ofYouTube playlists and one of my YouTubeplaylists had um videos a series ofvideos from Yuval Harare and you knowfive years ago I was interested in thatguy's work because I thought sapiens wasa good book you know like I wasfollowing him until obviously covert andeverything happened and you saw you knowwhat bug man was really about and youknow this guy's sort of saying you knowI remember like there was this whole youknow it was like a you know classicTwitter Fiasco you know that sort oflights up for 24 or 48 hours and theywere like oh you know Alex is like aworld economic Forum guy you know he'son the side of Yuval Harare fake becauseI was like you've got to be [ __ ]kidding me likelike what in the [ __ ] and you know theysort of pointed out that and they foundlike me referencing him in a previousarticle and stuff like that it's like ohyou know here's proof the gotcha I waslike okay bro likeno worries like you know all of theother stuff is irrelevant you know butthat's that's apparently relevant soyeah I just figuredyou know I I underappreciated privacyand I underappreciated how fickle youknow just people in general areum and I don't know it as you said likequality of a quantity and that's whatbecome my Mantra like I'm I'm really notinterested like for me now like I'm wayquicker to block way quicker to ignoreway quicker to muteum because my my time my energy is justit's more valuable I'd rather spend itwith my gorgeous wife on the [ __ ]beachum I'd rather go with her to [ __ ]CrossFit I'd rather write anotherarticle I'd rather work on than yourstartup you know I'd rather add a littlebit to my book like way more and youknow when I it's weird I've had such aneven social media fatigue man like I Ican't get into nasta I can't get intolike like I can't you know I bought someum thread writing stuff for umfor Twitter because I was you knowplanning that this year I was going tojust write threads and all that sort ofstuff I just don't give a [ __ ] like thisseriously just don't care like it's justso so meaningless to meum andyou know that's why I sort of killed mypodcast as well because I just you knowI'm sort of done like I don't reallycare about getting out there and youknow doing all that stuff anymore likeI don't know I got like it's it's a bita big big big sort of change for me andyeah it just feels really good well Imeanthis will come as no surprise because Iknow we line up on a lot of things butum you know I feel very similarly and Ithink a lot of people probably do tooand you know probably a Confluence ofreasons right I mean bear markets alwayskind of refocus people like what'simportant there's not as much loosemoney loose attention you know eventsand stuff dragging you with this way andthat you know so you have to you havemore time to determine what you want tofocus on and um and then there's alsolikefirst of all I totally agree and and I Ihad beengetting that social media fatigue for along time because I don't careabout followers or clout or notoriety oranything like that and you know if youdon't if you really don't care aboutthat howand I also like I I don't necessarilypresume that people want to know everylittle thought that pops into my headeven if it's like somewhat insightful soit's like if you put those two thingstogether you're probably not going to betweeting very muchumand and at the same time you know Elontook over Twitter I love it more freespeech less censorship but theexperience is also different and it'syou know much less yeah exactly it'sactually worse yeah right so you knowand that kind of sucks because I thinkhe did a good thing you know whateveryour opinions on Elon are but uhinformation can obviously be publishedmore freely on on Twitter now butwhatever he did you know made it a lessengaging experience for the otheraspects of that platform that that weall probably found valuableum you know so there's all these factorsthat that go into this stuff and and Ithink like I wouldn't be and I don'tthink you are but just broadly speakinglike I think it's good not to be it'sgood to reflect and make adjustments butnot be too harsh on past Behaviorbecause you were interfacing with adifferent time and context also rightright it's it's it's not even logical togo back with your current perspectiveand place it within that context becauseit's not how you would have beenthinking you know that the circumstancedrives a lot of your emotions and yourthoughts and your Ambitions and thingsyou find meaningfulso you know I think it's good to go backand reflect and reorient but notnecessarily you know have too much uhregret or guilt or anything associatedwith past behavior of course unless it'slike really egregious and you're a pieceof [ __ ] basically but you know it's adifferent storyum also man you know the other thingspeaking about fatigueumas the Twitter files drop and as there'smore free speech and like I'm glad thatit seems like the covid stuff is fallingapart and more truth is getting out likethat's all wonderful and I kind ofassumed it would eventually now maybe itmaybe it will never to the to the extentthat I would hope it does but obviouslypeople are able to discuss uh so-calledconspiracy theories more freely now thanthey were before and and that's greatbutthis obsession with the the enemies likeespecially in Bitcoin land like you saidthat you know you someone took you totask for like the world economic Forumstuff likeI just don't I so don't care about thosepeople at all becausesure I know they're powerful and they'reinfluential and maybe they're doingthings to try to [ __ ] up things that Ideem to be important and meaningful andthat I want to have in the world but Idon't see how me caring about themchanges that to your point like thething the the best thing that I think Ican do is engage in the things that makeme the strongest the happiest the mostfulfilled engaging things that are mostmeaningful and try to figure out what'smost valuable valuable but what I can dothat I can contribute to something andthat in itself is the process offighting back against that stuff notfinding someone's name on a website andbeing like you're a chill you're atwo-phase you're a spook or somethinglike thatlike if anything that's probablycounterproductive because then that sortof reactionary approach can beweaponized by people that actually wantto stir the pot or execute a psyop orsomething like that and so you knowsailor has been off to use this phraseand it you know uh it's not perfectlyapt here but you know he often saysdon't be a martyr be a winner and that'sthat kind of came to mind when you weresaying what you did because you know inin 2022 perhaps or leading up to thatand or you know these airplane arrestsand that kind of stuff I mean you weretaking a stand for what you thought waswrong and I have a ton of respect forthatbut to what you know at what cost youknow would you would you rather have ormoving forward instead of fighting thosesmall battles where there's not reallyanything to truly gain would you ratherHold Your Capacity and strength back anddeploy it where you can have thegreatest effect both for yourself andperhaps outwardly and do that and in ifwe all do thatisn't that the way that we build thecircular economy isn't that the way weobsolete the bad Tech the badbureaucracies the bad people like isn'tthat the way it's done not not fightingthese highly contentious battles and andstirring up all this tension everywherewhere we might be we might findsomething that's counter to our own youknow philosophy or perspective on thingsyeah I mean look maybe there's somethingto be said forlike thinking of it through the the lensof War right like so there's a time whenyou need to be a soldier on theBattlefront and you know maybe that isyou know arguing with someone at theairport or getting arrested on anairplane or something like that um butthen there's a time when you sort oflike move to you know uhI don't knowlieutenant and then you know Colonel andthen General right like you sort of youmove up and then you you fight a biggerbattleum as you said or you fight you know youfight more strategically and lesstactically and you know maybe it's justthe right of passage that we have to gothrough and so that way we remember it'slike you know what this cost me or whatI had to do to sort of stand up for whatI believe in etc etc so as you saidbefore you know maybe not being toocritical of that stuff uh is importantbut it's like taking taking at least theenergy and the spirit of you know or theessence of what that um pushback was andthen just playing a higher game and youknow sailor is someone who does thisvery well he's very very very verystrategic he's not tacticalum and you know what I was playing was atactical game and you knowyoung stupid full of energyum you know maybe I had to play theTactical game for a little whileum until I kind of realized that hey allright uh my stripes you know I got a fewBattle Scars and now it's time to dosomething more strategic and like acouple of things that I'm working on noware way more [ __ ] strategic andthey're going to be way more meaningfulin fighting the broader battleum but I ain't going to be doing it fromyou know 160 characters on Twitter orwhatever like 1000 characters Elon Musk[ __ ] up Twitter with now you know likeum ain't gonna happen there like I'mgonna do itfar more uh selectively and yeah just tohop on the word strategically soyeah I think to your point like the thebattle has to be fought at multiplelevels andyou know I'm I'm just choosing adifferent different game to play now Ithink you mentioned in in that piece orone of them that you know youand this is consistent with what youjust said but that your focus now ismore on quality perhaps or at leastthat's you know something that's becomemore elevated in terms of what drives oror determines your projects or actionsor whatever and uh you know again Itotally agree with that you it's notuncommon for like a year to have a themefor me at the beginning like it's just Iwrite a a several Page Letter to myselfevery like January 2nd let's say andusually it emerges in that and the onethis year wasand this will sound somewhat corny butit is what it is uh was Beauty likethat'sthat's the theme for the year and I'veI've been finding myself anytime I getdragged intoclown World stuff that is a good thingto reorient myself it's like is thisbeautiful is it you know is this thekind of thing you want to no it's notwhat else in your you know vicinity whatelse that you can focus on what elsethat you can work onyou know has the capacity to bebeautiful or isyou know it's inspiring in some way oris in that General neighborhood and umyou know it's beauty is hard to arguewith too and this is one of the thingsthat you'vetouched on a little bit in in the pastand people have also taken a little bitof issue with is the notion that uhbeauty is not subjective now I meanthere's an easy kind of likeor spectival way to discredit that andjust say wellyou're only one individual perceivingbeing so anything that you perceive issubjective in that sense butumI I think I like your points and I thinkin in today'sdialogue around that subject oreverything has become subjective andrelativistic right in in clown worldright sothere is no truth and there is no Beautyand you know so there's there's nothingbasically there's just chaos there is noorder and that's actually part of thethe point you make is thatyou know we tend towhat inspires us with that sense ofbeauty or when we find things that areyou knowof profound Symmetry and integrity withall other systems that we are nestledwithin most of which we we have no wayof perceiving but that's what that'swhat beautiful things do they condensedown those those patterns withinpatterns within patterns and they justshow up as one thing and you just you'reawestruck by them or you're you'reyour mind goes blank as a result of ofwitnessing themand um so all that just to say I mean Ithink that's a far for me at least andfor this year it's been helpful to bringme back on a more productive course whenI when I start kind of going off coursein focusing on that particular thinglike is thisis this a is this a beautiful Endeavoris this a beautiful way to devote yourattention this is a beautiful thing thatyou know you should begiving access to your Consciousness andyour perspective because that's whatyou're doing when you're sending yourattention all down all these threadsstreams whatever or do you want toredirect your attention to somethingbeautiful and how might that Orient yourbehavior better and I think the answeris a lot a lot better it's way moreeffectivepardon the pun but that's that'sbeautiful like honestly the theumI I still stand by it so I think youmight be referencing the tweet that Idid last year which was the bush pigtweet uh well only because I read it inin you referenced it in one of therecent articles yeah that's right okay Idid forget that I did that all right soyeah my bush pig tweet and the thing islike this is what I said earlier it'slike my tweet's actually accurate butit's just not delivered very nicelyright it was delivered very brutallyum you know the the context behind thatwas actually I had just gone throughum an immigration process where I wantedto strangle someoneum and like I was already angry and thenI saw a dumb tweet from somebody likeone of these sort of Trad masculine guyssaying that you know uh Beauty in yourpartner like in your wife is like a lowpriority like it doesn't matter and Iwas like[ __ ] out of here like beauty is soimportant like and I don't care whatanyone says like you know you you wantto like beauty is actually you knowrepresentative of so much more as yousaid symmetry Harmony uh Health like allof these sorts of things and like tosort ofum you know to me that was just likewhen I read that tweet it was like uh Icould smell cope coming through comingthrough the things so like you knowwe're sort of driving through and youknow my you know classic Twitter liketirade message I was like all right [ __ ]you and then like the the the bush piguh comment came outand there was there was a section inthat which was about obviously passingon Superior genes and I meant that aslike you know what you should do is youshould find like if you're a man youknow the you're Judy bound to find awoman with extraordinary genes so thatyou can increase the um the likelihoodof you know success and uh you knowBeauty for your childrenum because I you know as much as peoplemight not like to admit this like Beautydoes helpum you know it comes with its own costslike for example my wife you know shehas she gets so much Envy from peoplelike and she's grown up like thatbecause she's just naturally [ __ ]gorgeous is naturally symmetric she'snaturally she's got all the sort of thebeautiful attributes and you know thethe downside of that is you know peoplesort of treat you differently you knowthey you know they try and like like sheshe has a lot of trouble with otherwomen because other women are alwayslike trying to you know uh hurt her ordo something in other ways because thissort of jealous of her in some sense butanyway like at the end of the dayirrespective of those costs I think it'sstill better to beum you know to pursue Beauty and to bebeautiful in some sense so anyway thewhen I said that then obviously you knowhalf of Twitter sort of lost their mindsand they're like oh you know [ __ ]jeans and you're a [ __ ] [ __ ] andyou know what the [ __ ] are you talkingabout about jeans for and everythinglike they're not like they missed thepoint like I know I'm [ __ ] short Idon't have [ __ ] great genes so I likeI'm married you know I'm married [ __ ]woman that has better physical genesthan I do I have the [ __ ] brain bringus together and you know we're gonnahave um we're gonna have great babiesbut anyway like coming back to your umto your point about uh Beauty it's it'sfundamentally not subjective it isreally not subjective and I think thisis this is something that a lot of theuh the libertarian you know Bitcoin orindividualist sort of groups miss out onum and and it's actually no wonder why alot of libertarian people are actuallylike [ __ ] fat you knowbasement dwelling keyboard Warriorsthere he is he's back okay I'm back allrightbut like you you have a lot of that sortof class of um of people who will go andtry and make a philosophical argumentfor beauty being completely subjectivejust because they worked out that valuesubjectiveum and they'll try and lump it in thesame place but I'm sorry there isactually objective things in theuniverseum you know there is things that areharmonic there's you know like music isobjectively sounds good you know becauseit's got you know eight octaves likethere is things that whether we canexplain it or not existum you know when you look at a sunsetyou know when you look at the mountainsyou know when you look at the sort ofthe earth and that sort of pale blue dotyou know ore effect like there arethings that exist that um that transcendsubjective valuations in the whole[ __ ] libertarianum ethos of like you know nothing has umobjective value or whatever andyou know beauty is one of those thingsand um and I'll stand by that I couldn'tcare lessum you know what people say but I Iactually one of the funny things here isthat Ihad a debate with a girl in [ __ ]Brazil like over um over text uh andthis was like sort of years agoum about this subjective nature ofbeauty and she actually stumped mebecause I was like full-on in mylibertarian Zone like you know I wasdoing podcasts at that time with likeyou know kinsella and all these peopleand you know she asked me is beautyobjective or subjective and I was likeof course everything's subjective youknow like uh blah blah and I sort ofmade this whole you know classic uhanako Capital sort of argument of um whybeauty is subjective and she's like yeahnah I don't agree with you um I thinkbeauty is both subjective and objectivethere's subjective elements to it butthere's a sort of higher orderobjectivity to beauty and you know sheshe explained a few examples I can'tremember him now it was a couple yearsago but that sort of stuck with me I waslike [ __ ] there's you knowI'm actually wrong and from that pointon like I sort ofyou know my thinking around that changedand you know the more mature I've becomeThe more I've like particularly whenI've read history and things likestories of the greats and of the youknow of the people who've moved theworld and changed the world like sort ofyou know reading some nature and thegreat man theory of you know history andall that sort of stuff you come torealize thatthings like Beautyyou know transcend uh you know the thechaos of the mundane and there's um yeahI I think there's something to be to belearned from that andyou know would the current Alex say itdifferently uh yesum butanyway it had had to be said at the timeand but you knowit's a very interesting topic and youknow one that I've been thinking andwriting a lot about but I mean part ofit part of the debate around it wouldjust be like a matter of definitionright and that's just that's not aninteresting debate but I thinkeverything is experienced subjectivelyright so for from that perspective yesyou can call everything subjective butthethe results or the things that manifestin the world obviously are have adifference in quality right as you saidthings can be more harmonious they canbe harmoniously productive so you canget flourishing let's say or they can bedestructive they can be degrading theycan be disintegrating they can breakthey can cause breakdownand um it almost seems like you knowand and this is kind of the irony isthat a lot of these you know libertarianpeople if we're going with this kind ofstereotypeis that they would equally rail againstthis like kind of Generalmoral relativism that's you knowhappening in the world today they wouldsay that it's bad but they themselvesare kind of taking the same positionbecause they're saying that everythingis subjective and there are no absolutesright there are no absolute truths andthen if you you look at like what dothose perspectives produce in the worldum as you say like that'll show up inyour body they'll show up in your familyit'll show up in your intellect your wayyou articulate yourself what you're ableto build in terms of a life thecommunity the community that you're apart ofand this is actually one of the thingsthat lends itself to the argument forlet let's just say like a traditionalFaith what does acting as if an absolutetruth does exist in the form of what youmight call God or any other label youput on it what is thatproduce in this reality right what isthat said of what what are thoseparameters elicit and you know again wepeople will split hairs on this becausemuch has been much uh bad and and tragicthings have Arisen in the name ofreligious face but on an individuallevel it seems like it produces thingsthat are in harmony with something rightbecause they're able to be built in amanner that's strong that's cohesivethat's generative that's harmoniousthat's you know all those good thingsand that's apparent when you when youmeet these people or these communitiesor whateverand again like with this is a longdiscussion if we really wanted to totease apart all the Nuance but just tosay I mean I thinkuhthe notion that there is somethingin the realm of Truth in the realm ofbeauty that coherence with or at leastappreciation ofgeneratesoutcomes of like kind or beneficialoutcomes whereas rejection of orignorance ofgenerates the opposite and so does thatnot suggest that there is somethingmore than just your subjective opinionon a given thing like you can stillreject something that's beautiful butthat doesn't mean it's not beautifulthat that would be the case that wouldbe the argument in in such acircumstance like you can reject truththat doesn't mean it's not true it justmeans you suffer the consequences ofrejecting itokay and um you know I I think uh wellthat's a discussion that should probablybe had in Greater detail or writtenabout more because I mean I think thattouches on the religious domain ittouches on beauty it touches oneconomics it touches on valueand uh you know it doesn't maybe itdoesn't get that much umpress in in the age of like the leftUltra relativistic stuff and in in theright Ultra individualistic stuff whereagain in in neither case is there reallyanyabsolute truth or at least the theappreciation of or or recognition ofabsolute truth should it existyeah yeah you as you were describingthat I thought of like you know thisidea of you know you're you're free tobe fat if you want to like for examplebut don'ttell me that it's beautiful you know orvirtuous or anything like that you knowyou're you're free to you know paintyour [ __ ] housepolka dot colors and rainbows and allthat sort of stuff but don't tell methat that's beautiful you know likeyou're free to make a piece of artthat's a [ __ ] banana with a stickytape on itum but don't try and make the argumentthat it's beautiful like so all you knowand you know that that's so spot on likeyou know you're you're subjectiveinterpretation of uh what you think isbeautiful and that is sort of irrelevantumyou know the other the other thing Ithink of a lot is in this context is umlike churches you know like thesemassive ornate churches and people youknow a lot of secular people will gointo them and you know they'll beawe-inspiring in some way they'll feelsomething and they'll respect it but youknow it's like why is that soawe-inspiring why does that conjure upthose emotions why is it why you knowwhy was so much work devoted to doingthem and also what has been brought tobear to put that together and again inline of the thinking we were justtalking about like I think at least anelement of that because I'm sure there'smanyisthink of the mathematics and thearchitecture and the geometry and thedetail like all the other disciplinesall the other knowledge that hasconverged to allow this thing tomanifest to be builtand all of that stufflike is necessarily Tethered to physicallaws patterns that were were embeddedwithin right like truths things thatlike gravity andand math in geometry and math and andyou know like all these things thatwe've had to figure out how they workand then the these these these buildingsare representations of like the heightof our ability to to weave something inbetween those let's call them Absolutetruths and then if we can be successfulin doing that then we stand back from itand go like wow like we've just we'vejust brought together so many forces toallow this thing to exist and it isalmost uh always awe-inspiring you knowif you have any sort of sensibilitywhatsoever yeah you're literallydescribing Harmony there like that yeahthe bringing together of things so thatthey fit is a Harmony of assaults andyeah that's that's essentially you knowthe the best version of you know the thebest kind of like uh you know rawdefinition of beauty that I can think ofis that you know that thing that isharmony the you know things comingtogether they fit and they they justthey I don't know they fit there's noother word sort of describing yeah yeahI mean whether it's beauty or truth likeperhapsyou know a possible definition is thethings that Foster the greatest Harmonyright so as your example in music likewhen you play the notes and thefrequencies that they all they'recontained they're in and all that kindof stuffproper properly you get a Harmony when afamily or a community is oriented by aparticular truth you get flourishing youget a Harmony between its members andall that kind of stuff and the same istrue for a building you know when youbring together the knowledge of of allthe forces that it's acting Withinyou get you have the potential to get aHarmony you know so perhaps Harmony andbeauty is simply the result of properlynavigating the forces that you'resubjected to andbringing them together inthe truth yeah like appreciate truthformrecognizing and appreciating the truthof the forces that you're subject to andthen manipulating the world to thatrecognizes that and I think that's partof the reason why we say in in somethinglike a church we're glorifyingGod you know the all-encompassing allthose forces all encompassed because itis that it isit is recognizing that those are theforces that exist and we're we'respending our time and resources to trytoshowcase you know something about themin our building of that and that'sthat's that's glorifying them in somewaytotally totally and I mean that thatextends obviously toideas to written work right visualsum to I mean down to likeyou know the way you construct your bodyright like you know to to go like I meanyou have your two different examplesright you've got I always use that Memeof the Indian fake bodybuilder whopumped his muscles up full of Syntholright yeah yeah like you know that's notyou can tell that's not beautiful rightbecause it's like it's out of proportionit's all messed up and then you sort ofhave the other spectrum is like peopleyou know and we see this a lot onTwitter and everything is like you'vegot these fat slobs that are you know oncover magazines now it's like I'm sorrybut that's just it's disgusting it's notbeautiful yeah um you know versus youknow someone who's put the work in toyou know shape their body to look goodand you know I guess you know withoutgoing down this Rabbit Hole too much butyou know women and men are different inthis case is like men have to constructthemselves whereas women are born uhlargelyum you know with their assets and yesthey have to take care of themselves anddo all that sort of stuff but you knowwomen have a different genetic apredisposition than men do and we haveto construct ourselves so like you knowI get up [ __ ] every morning go on busmass at the gym so that I am not a[ __ ] fat slob or you know unfit oryou know have a gut or whatever likethat because you know there's there'ssomething to say about Aesthetics andthen as you said all the stuff that goesin behind that to kind of producesomething ofyou know of beauty and everything is auh submission to higher truth as yousaid like yeah you know it's it's asubmission to you know that maybeperhaps the greatest truth of all proofof work right like you have to work atsomething to to produce something ofbeauty yeah I think that's well said andthe only other thing I will sayhopefully uh isas a can not as a counter argument tothis but as I thinklegitimate Nuance isas you mentioned in so much your writingI mean hierarchies develop anywherewhere there is value or meaning rightit's just inevitable it's howConsciousness Works basically it's howhuman societies organize all that kindof stuff and so an interesting questionmight bewhat is the hierarchy of beauty so wecould and and none of these are separateseparable right they're they're allInseparable but let's just say you knowyou might say wow thatyou see a woman on the beach and she's a10 out of 10 physiologically butto what degree doesin your if you come to know that personor come to know another person youperceive a tremendous Beauty in theirsoul let's say and just how they show upin life and how you know whoever whoeverthey are like whatever your metrics areyou know whether it's compassion empathylove all that kind of stuff and youperceive a beauty of that kind and thenyou know a question is it's like wellwhich beauty is higher up on thehierarchy and you know we might say wellthat's up to each person to decide butin line with this discussion we've beenhaving it's like well is there an actualprop so-called proper place in thehierarchy for those different forms ofbeauty you know because just as a bodyor a church is molded by let's say thosethose truths that we've been discussingso too would be one's character andtheir Consciousness and how they're abletoform that and and leverage it andexpress it into the world I mean that isalso still subject to all theseinvisible absolute forces let's say andso which one is which one is moreimportant or which one is more valuablein the end and maybe it's the case thatit's you knowI think a lot of people would probablysay this it's not theumit's not the physiological Beauty it'stheit's the it's the spirit it's thepersonality it's the characteryes yes we are yeah um yeah so the theonly point I was making was like isthere a hierarchy of of beauty becausewe tend we tend to think of it as justyou know physical Beauty right butum you know it's certainly the case thatthe beauty of uh someone's solecharacter personality whatever couldsupersede that of of their physiologyand therefore one might be rational inin acting in in accord with thatenacting as though that we're moreimportant and of course many people doright and this is that's probably someof the source of the pushback that yougot in particular and maybe you weremaking just still like a more isolatedpoint on physical Beauty itself but Ithink like especially when you'rechoosing a partner let's say I meanagain hierarchies abound everywhere andso when we're when we're when we'retalking about something like Beauty inrelation to beauty of an individual wellyes it's like their physical beauty isthe most obvious one but there's otherelements of them that you might deembeautiful and there might even be moreuh important or consequent consequentialto you than their physiological Beautyand that wouldsomewhat counter what we were sayingbefore althoughI don't think it doesn't it doesn'tcounter I think they're all they're allintertwined right right because like andso so there's there's not only the thehierarchy but generallyum there there are indicators of eachother right so yeah sure I've I've datedhot chicks that have [ __ ] two braincellsum and that have the personality of a[ __ ] you know a park bench right anddid I marry them hell no like so sothere's like you know the these thingsgenerally sort of uh you know so that'sactually an example of um of uh thehierarchy piece but then what I've alsofound is that most people who um and andagain this is a heuristic it's not intrue all of the time but you know aswith all heuristics but people whogenerally put the effort in to look acertain way physicallyum and actually put the work and I'm notsaying like shoot themselves with a[ __ ] makeup gun but actually put thework in to do to do some workum that generally says something aboutthe kind of character or inner beautythey have as well and you know so when Italk about that sort of stuff that'ssort of what I mean andum you know often the the physical is anindicator and you know Anita talks aboutthis is like you know one of the modernfallacies is the sort of separation ofum the mind and the body as if they youknow evolve separately it's like well noI'm [ __ ] sorry they didn't like thatthe mind and the body are inextricablylinked like what makes us human is thatwe have a hand and we have these eyesthat you know feedback loops to thebrain um and you know and sort ofSpangler talks about this uh in in depthin his book man and Technics which isone of the best like it's one of thoseshort reads that'll like blow your mindand you know he just sort of says likethe the eyes arewould allow us to perceive the worldum and you know we have predatorizedlike our eyes are put on the front ofour head they're not on the side like[ __ ] herbivoresum which uh which is prey right so wehave predatorized and we have thisappendage called the hand which isunique in the animal kingdom to suchdegree that we can actually manipulatespace uh to a far greater dexterity uhand uh complexity than any other specieson the planet can doum and you sort of combine those youhave this unique feedback loop to thebrain that is you know arguably wheresomeone like Spangler saysum you know at least our level ofintelligence was able to sort of developfrom so anyway what I'm trying to saywith that is that um you know physicalBeautydoes have a relationship to you know ina beauty Soulful Beauty you knowintellectual Beauty and all this sort ofstuff stuff that there is somethingthere um all right sowe we should probably close down soonbut there's there's two things I wantedto uh to bring upright so in in your article about thekind ofpreparing oneself for this whole Bitcoinparadigm shift to take longer than youknow some of its proponents might likeumyou mentioned a couple things one isthe tinkering with Bitcoin you know andthis is kind of an ever-presentdiscussion debate like how much shouldwe Tinker with this thing and I I thinkfrom to my in my opinion it was reallynot enough discussion on on that topicyou know it seems to be the case thatyou know technically proficient peoplecore developers would ever come up andsay hey like look that we can makeBitcoin do this you know wouldn't thatbe great and then you know people goyeah that would be cool that would youknow let's let's do that or yeah thatwould be cool but let's not do itbecause then there's no real likethere's no real discussion about likehow we should be looking at changes tothis thing and to what degree does thefrequency of changes create you knowattack vectors in the future and alsoand to to the point from your article oryou know what your article made me thinkabout is likehow much patience should we be havingyou know because you you often hear thethe comment like well if we're gonna ifwe want Bitcoin to be adopted by morepeople you know it has to actdifferently you know it has to do X Yand Z to appeal to you know whateverdemographicum and then so it's like oh well we needto build that into Bitcoin so that itcan appeal to them but it's like wellhow do we know that how do we know it'snot just a matter of time how do we knowit's not just to your point agenerational thing like there's just itdoesn't matter what you make it do acertain portion of people probably a bigportion are not going to be interestedright now and they probably won't beinterested in 10 years maybe in 20 yearsthey will in 30 years they almostcertainly will butyou know so it made me think of thatpoint ofor the theinsufficient discourse in my opinionabout how we should belooking atthe development of Bitcoin and how wemake changes to it you know I thinkeveryone would agree if there's anythingcatastrophic happening that needs to befixed a bug or whatever absolutely thatthat takes priority but how should we beprioritizing and thinking about changesthat are not Mission critical that arejust nice to haves and to what and whatare the trade-offs when we actuallydecide to make those changesyeah so there's two things I want tosort of point out there one is youmentioned the um kind of the measuresright and one that I hear get gettingthrown a lot and thrown around a lot islike oh you know you look atum how many developers there are in theBitcoin ecosystem versus like theethereum one that's likeso like congratulations bro likeyou got more devs doesn't mean [ __ ] I'msorry but like you know bitcoin's not ait's not a software platform you knowit's not a it's not a virtual machine tosort of build icos and crap off likeit's it's like you people are trying toapply these you know strange measuresit's like it's it's almost like sayingumyou know my my my concrete has morenutrients uh so it has you know likesorry my food has more nutrients thanyour concrete right okay I'm sure itdoes bro but like it doesn't matter likeit's a it's a it's a different thing andthis is why I sort of I laid out thearticle in the beginning with like okaybitcoin's not a it's not an app it's nota smartphone it's not a computer it'snot a website it's not a product or aservice you know it's it's none of thesethings it's a it's it's not a technologyso stop trying to like uh project thesetechnological adoption codes on it'slike oh yeah bitcoin's been around for15 years and you know nothing's happenedit's like well no something has happenedbut you know Bitcoins is sort ofsocioeconomic technological like it'sall these things sort of wrapped intoone and you know when you think about itlike what we're asking people to do allaround the world is trust their [ __ ]wealth man with something that theydon't understand like and just giving itmore features doesn't mean more peopleare going to understand it like if youcan do uh conditional you know uhcovenant-based transactions on bitcoindo you think that's going to make my mumlike put all her wealth in itno it's it's no no way in hell likeso so anyway to sort of what you saidlike you knowBitcoin is just gonna you know it'snumber one actualfeature is actually the unchangeablenessof it so you know what what it benefitsfrom is you know more timein which it doesn't change and it youknow maintains sort of the promise andthe narrative that has sort of got it tothis stage and you know at some pointas the rest of the world deterioratesyou know people sort of start to changethe lens through which they view Bitcoinas not uh internet funny money but assound money and that that I just don'tthink we can speed up there's notechnical Innovation that can speed upbitcoin's perception by the world assound moneyum you can't change 5 000 years ofconditioning uh with some you knowtechnical upgrades it's just not goingto work and like you know I I wasn'tthis harsh in the um in the article Iwas trying to be more pragmatic andtrying to think of it generationally butI honestly think like that sort ofdawned on me I was you know I was atSatoshi Roundtableum a couple weeks ago andyou know some of the talk was likedriving me crazy it's like oh you knowwe have to do this you know we have todo that uh you know it's like sort of asif like bitcoin's under some existentialthreat tomorrow of ethereum eclipsing itlike bro come on likethat there's there's nothing going wrongat the moment and like the drive changestuff like kind of annoys me and likeI'm not I'm not involved enough tounderstand all the intricacies of whyyou know drive chain is better and allof the stuff that it's going to enableBitcoin to do but you know I rememberlike having a discussion with someoneand they sort of said likeyou know drivetrain is a better form ofliquid you know and you know liquidobviously sucksum you know no one's using it and I saidthank you you just proved the point noone's using liquid because you can doeverything you can do like that drivechain does but news flash no one gives a[ __ ]so if we're gonna go and like do allthis stuff to bitcoinum and build you know a bunch of extrafeatures into it and no one's going togive a [ __ ] thenI'm sorry it's just you know it's apoint yeah well that's I mean that's thepoint I'm getting at right like to whatextentdo our expectations for this phenomenonthe speed of it what it looks like youknow all that kind of stuffcause us to be insufficiently humble inrelation to this supposed absolute rightand again I meanwe kind of wind up the same structure Ithink uh is evident in many differentplaces perhaps no more than thereligious right like you you you you yousubmit to an absolute and that's part ofthe act of of preserving it or ofaccessing its value let's say and youknow I I obviously don't know the answerhere but II do get nervous when I just seepeople have basically arbitraryexpectations oh Bitcoin should be moreadopted by now really who who says thatwhy should it be more adopted right nowor Bitcoin should be we should havehyper big organization in 10 yearswhy where is that written you know instone and So based off of thoseexpectations then ideas come up and thenpeople want to make themselves relevantI don't mean that pejoratively at all Imean we all want relevance right we wantto commit ourselves to meaningful workand so you go oh well it's not where itshould be I have the capacity to to dosomething to make it something differentsomething make it more attractive makeit meet that expectation of mine and soI'm going to do that and then we get youknow we getpotentially harmful tinkering and thequestion is is likehow harmful is that and you know maybeit's not that harmful you know on acertain frequency but maybe thatfrequency picks up when whenyou know because anytime you dosomething and the consequences don'tmanifest you think oh you know so sweetit worked and we you get Bolder andBolder and Bolder you get less lesshumble and less humble and less humbleuntil you actuallyyou know you break the things yeah youimpair it or you you're whatever and soagain the question is ishow like where is this discussion andhow much patience should we be having tomanage those expectations and allowourselves or dedicate ourselves to bemore humble towards what's actuallyhappening hereyeah I mean it'syou know you you just touched onsomething really good there is like theyou know the problem may not be thechange specifically the problem may bethe uh that the change actually issuccessful and does no damage and setsthe stage for a further change and afurther change and it basically changesthe um the ethos of what we're doing andI think bitcoin's primary feature isthat it's unchangeable or that itdoesn't change like and it and and Ithink that that point isyeah probably hasn't dawned on enoughpeopleum particularly those that are moretechnicallyuminclined I would say is you know like ifyou're technically inclined and you'reyou know you're proficient at you knowtinkering and stuff like that you'llyour predisposition is towards you knowchanging and tinkering stuff butI I really don't think that umyou know overring towards no issometimes just a better decision justyeah and yeah and as you as you tinkerand as the frequency of those changesoccur then you'reuh your sphere of things that arelegitimately on the table for changejust grows right it's like first it'slike all right we have this big we'renot going to change all these differentthings and then you're like oh well wecan we can change this that's notcritical or we can change that and thenuntil you wind up being like well Iguess we can changeanything about it if we canconjure up a type of logic or rationaleright I mean and that that's the thingthat that concerns me to a certaindegree it's likewho who said you know as we were sayingearlier kind of in in relation to youryou know perspective and way of actingduring the covert years let's say it'slike how do you know that however you'redevising your logic your rationale orwhat your expectations or what you thinkof things should beI mean how do you know that's valid oras valid as it could be you know we'reall fallible we all make mistakes we allhave blind spots and so I again I thinkyou know I share the opinion with youlike one the mostuh valuable thing about this is that itthere's an element of it that does notchange and to what extent doeshow much creep is there basically towardultimately being at the doorstep ofrationalizing changing even the thingthat supposedly can't be changed let'ssay 21 million yeah and you know there'salready discourse about that and sothere's there's discourse and it'salways technicaland I'd like to see more discussionaboutuh how people should be thinking hownode Runners you know people that aregoing going to be you know so-calledcasting votes and things like this howthey should be thinking aboutuh change to this system at all and whatchanges are legitimate and how patientwe should be being and you know all thedifferent stuff that's wrapped up inthat is by no means a simplesimple subject but is probably the mostimportant one you know I just don't seeit that much Dialogue on it this iswhere like people's umpeople's knowledge base around Bitcoindoes need to broaden right and you knowit's it's almost it's funny to watchlike the you know almost the differentschools in in sort of the Bitcoinecosystem sort of emerge out of this youknow you've got the the techies kind ofcoming out and saying you know we needto do this and then almost like theAustrian kind of thinkers and all thatsort of stuff saying well you know nolike you know Bitcoin is money and thenthere's almost like this kind of thirdGroup which is you know maybe like aa more holistic Viewpoint of you knowBitcoin as a as a movement or as likeyou know as we've called it like thisyou know truth or this you know thisthingum and you know we sort ofyou know I think maybe we kind of sitmore in that camp andyou know I I align far more with thesort of the Austrian thinking of this isthis is a money first and foremostum I think it's more than just the moneyyou know I think it's you know got a lotmore a lot more going on but uh when Isort of view it through that lensyou know if anything like while thetechnological backbone of Bitcoin islikeuh well I should rephrase thetechnological element of Bitcoin is thebackbone likeif you know without the technology itdoesn't existum you know what that represents issomething of you know higher order Idon't know if I'm articulating thatcorrectly but like that that higherorder discussion as you said is notbeing had like we're having a technicaldiscussion we're in the [ __ ] weedsarguing about whether a feature isuseful or notum and we're missing the the higherargument of whether we should even behaving that discussion or not yeah andthat's a and that's a different that's acompletely differentumlevel of discussion uh and I I would sayprobably more important level ofdiscussion considering the importance ofwhat the hell we've got in our handshere like I I want to know that thestuff that I've got in Cold Storagemulti-sig is going to be there 100 yearsfrom nowlike and and I'm pretty sure that if wedon't [ __ ] touch Bitcoin at themoment like or ever again it's probablystill going to be thereumbut I'm not sure that if we startmessing with things whether that's goingto be the caseand that to me is just hands down justtells me you know what sort of uh how weshould view any any potential technicalchanges yeah you know it sometimes makesme think and the comparison is notperfectly apt and it's already happenedto some degree in in [ __ ] coins but youknow aseven the dominant monotheistic religionsof the past have fractured in variousways as they've developed because ofeffectively ideological differencesbetween the different factionswill that be bitcoin's fate in in in thefuture like will it be oh this groupyou know it's stillI mean again that has happened to somedegree but even a narrower uhdisagreement and you know certain peoplego this way certain people go that wayyou know who knows but uh again I justit's an interesting one yeah that is aninteresting one yeah kind of like uh youknow maybe maybe there's like a fewflavors of Bitcoinum in the future and I mean that thatwould I mean that would kind of suckum you knowmaybe that you know might be anintermediate phase because you know sortof money does have thisuhkind of concentrating effect right rightit's a little bit Yeah different than anideology so I still think you know on along enough time yeah exactly we getthere but um you know there is there isthe risk that we kind of throw our ownstupidity and hubris kind of putourselves through another 50 years oflikestupidity and hubris right and thatthat's the thing that we should at leastto the extent that we can try touh prevent but you know we're alwaysbuilding towers of Babel right yeah weare yeah totallyum all right lastgo ahead I was just gonna say last uhlast thing that I have for you isand again I think this is highly bearMarket driven butwell I mean I I think the the sentimentsthat you and I shared earlier on aboutreadjusting Focus I again I I've noticeda lot of people doing that and it's justit's people seem far more committed tocutting out noise cutting outdistractions cutting out things thataren't important or meaningful andfocusing on those that are whether theybe in the realm of health career youknow whateverum and I wonder if that's just ourcohort and this current time or and I'mthinking about this through the lens ofyour article about the different phasesof bitcoin's developmentum like why is it seemingly kind ofgoing quiet around here and is Willas new people come in let's say you youcome in today you're new like you youread all the books and stuff but there'snot the same amount of exuberance andexcitement and hoopla that there hasbeen in other periodswill that inform how you go about doingthis thing like you just look around andyou're like oh so people just adopt thisthey saving it they use it where theycan and where they want to and otherwisethey go on about their life trying tomove towards what's most valuable andmeaningful to them and that makes a tonof sense to me so I'm going to do thatand it like so my question is do youthink we're that's kind of a part of thenext phase that we're moving into or isit just you know bear Market things mymy guess is that we're probablyI think that will come my guess is thatprobably at least my first generation uhguess of like the first 20 years isprobably going to be on point like weprobably have to go through 20 years ofthe infection stage and I think thespeculation needs to just drivebitcoin's liquidity up so I'm kind oflike thinking of this first phasethrough a through an economic lensum and then I'm extrapolating backwardssaying okay well if we're lookingthrough it through an economic lens howdo we actually get this and then thepsychological lenses that we still treatit like a gambling thingum and I'm also just thinking becauseyou know through all the traveling thatI've done and you know I'm sort ofbuildingnetworks outside of Bitcoin nowum and when I just talk to people thatthey still you know just fundamentallynot ready like I tried to pay my rentthe other day uh where I am now inBitcoin and I couldn't you know theperson was like oh no I'm not I try todo that too and they even have a like aledger and they you know they they haveBitcoin and [ __ ] coins and all that kindof stuff but they weren't interested inanymore oh really okay interesting okayso so I mean this one didn't have aledger or anything but it was just likeoh you know we don't do that here rightthat was sort of the response so so thatkind of tells me like we've probablystill got quite a way and my guess likewith sort of two more halvings beforethe end of this decadeum we'll probably see at least thetransition towards that and maybe youknow after the second halving you knowthe the proverbial bear Market thatcomes after thatyou know maybe from an amplitudestandpoint it's you know more subtlebecauseI mean two halvings we could be at thatmillion dollar Mark and at that pointyou've got sort of senseat parity andthat's a really important point forBitcoin is because at that point I don'tthink people will be looking at theBitcoin price as much it'll be the sadpriceum like that I think there's a there's areal phase shift kind of kind of likethink aboutyou know phase shifts the best exampleis like water ice and gas right sothere's a particular point at which theyou know the H2O actually transformsinto a different state and you knowthere's like gas guessyou know then liquid and then all of asudden liquid liquid and then all of asuddenum uh solid soBitcoin will probably go through thesame thing in these sort of generationalshifts likeonce the perception of Bitcoin is thathey this is like a million dollars likethe average person will not be able tobuy a Bitcoin um you know it'll be aresult like a whole Bitcoin will sort ofmove into a new phase and it'll beperceived as something that only youknow organizations or the very rich canactually still acquire and they probablywon't look like maybe organizations willput it on their balance sheet because ata million dollars not onlyum you know is it sort of reserved forthat sort of stat uh layer or status butalso at a million dollars you'll have somuch more liquidity that you know a tenthousand dollar a day price movement andprice is meaningless so you you know yousort of dampen the volatility at thatpointso at that point organizations will bemore Akin or likely to uh to putting iton their treasury butmost people then will begin to perceiveBitcoin as satoshi's and you know mostapplications will probably not representBitcoin in terms of what you're sendinglike I think that phase will havedisappeared like everything will be insetsum and the relationship to bitcoin youknow with the dampening of thevolatility and the way we interact withit and how we perceive it I think willchange the behavior and yeah maybe twotwo halvings from nowum we start to maybe move into whatyou're discussing which is thedifference of yeah I just saving thisit's what I have that's where I keep mysavings and I'm no longer trying togamble with it because you know thegambling opportunity came and went thatwas the last phase so for for peoplelike you and I and you know many peoplewe know that have been here for a whilebecause again I get this sense ofFocus like it's probably the right wordbut I think a lot of people like yeah Iget it I've seen all the stuff chartsthesis macro stuffyou know I pretty much get it and Idon't need you know that stuff doesn'tinterest me as much anymore and so I'mjust gonna focus on what's mostmeaningful stack my SATs and you know goon to becoming and contributing to thissort of parallel economy all right isthat just me do you notice uh you knowsomething similar in yourself or in thepeople you mix it up with that there'skind of aand I I it's not ait's not a bad thing I'm not saying thatpeople get are bored with things I'mjust I think people are just likeI get it and it's more it's a better useof my time to focus on either things Idon't get or that I need to work towardsand and build rather than you know keepgiving me myself the dopamine hit ofthings I already get by people I alreadyknow their stick and and that kind ofstuffMaybemaybe maybe maybe I thinklikemaybe there's like a you know afive-year time span you know that youhave to sort of go through and be likereally in it and you know writing andcommenting on Twitter and you knowspaces and all this sort of stuffum and you know maybe you have to gothrough a couple bear cycles and acouple bull cycles and all that sort ofstuff to kind of get theumyou know maybe your own personal phaseshift right right and maybe we all haveto go through a personal faith shiftthat might you know on average last fiveyears and then sort of collectivelyenough people have gone through thatfive years phase shift that we have alarge enoughcohort that we then you know move intothe next you know the larger Collectivephase shift of Bitcoin and the way it'sperceived in the marketplace itselfbecauseyou know arguably you know the peoplewho got into Bitcoin in 2010 2011umI think a lot of them are far more quietyou know than sort of the the class thatgot in you know 2015 2016.um and then you know I'm honestly happylike at this point to pass the you knowbaton on to the class of 2020 and theycan go to war on Twitter and you know dotheir thingum and sort of carry Bitcoin through thenext cycleum yeah I'll be I'll be far more quietabout it um and that feels good so yeahmaybe there's a thing thereumand we've all got to sort of like earnour stripes in some sense yeah I mean II pretty much the reason why I ask isbecause it's hard from as is the caseeither with you now or what I'm sureyou'll find It's like because we've bothuh focused right and step back fromcertainplacing our attention it's in certainplaces it's hard to gauge right like Ican't tell if everyone is just offliving their best life or if that's justyou know me and you and a group of otheryou know some other peopleum but anyways all right this isactually the last thing because I Iwanted to ask it to you in the lasttopic but I forgot but as part of andthen I promise I'll let you go um aspart of theuh uh this whole like how and whenshould Bitcoin be changed sort ofargumentI mean you and I have discussed this alot as of many others that Bitcoinchanges you right and I thinknecessarily part of the reason itchanges you is because of what it is nowwe might spend hours and hours trying toarticulate what Bitcoin is and itsmeaning and its implications and allthat so I don't want to get into that Ijust want to say that's how thingschange you right like it's youinterfacing with something as it issomething it's nature what it representsand the relationship there is whatcauses one to change and people arefinding that Bitcoin is incrediblytransformational let's say becausewhatever it is is having that effect andI think a lot of us tend to think thatthose are very positive Transformationsyou know I've heard countless from frompeople you know like known people andUnknown People about how engaging inthis learning about it yeah adopting itin their life has had profound positiveinfluencesand one of the things that Iam considering and borderline concernedabout is if we continue down that roadof continuously changing this thingagain to what degree are we making itconform to our inefficiencies to ourinsecurities to our imperfectionsinstead offorcing ourselves to adapt to it and itseems to be the case that the latter isa far more productive healthyconstructiveum way of going about things because ofthe results that it elicits I mean againwe go back to clown world one of theways you could characterize clown worldis just people expecting the world toconform to them to their biases theirprejudices their [ __ ] theirinsecurities their fears theirweaknesses all that stuff and so itseems like part of the reason whyBitcoin is exerting thispositive trend impact on people isbecause it's doing the opposite it'ssaying I ain't changing if you want likeme in your life you're the one that hasto change you have to take theresponsibility you have to learn youhave to expand your understanding orintellectual capacity in a number ofdifferent areas you have to enhance youknow blah blah blah all the way down theline and so one of the concerns is and Iyou know perhaps again you know theTower of Babel sort of thing is a goodmetaphor butwe change it so much that it has adiminishing impact onit has diminishing demands on the onchanges in ourselves which arebeneficial and do we just continue toneuter that untilwe've conformed it to ourselves ratherthan the opposite way around and andthat is a far less beneficialcircumstance than otherwise could havebeen the caseman totally you touched on such a suchan important point so it reminds me ofthe safety Dean uh wrote a piece for theBitcoin times edition five for theAustrian Edition any it's called makingtime preference great again or somethingwill start making time preference lowagainum and that this is something that loadsof bitcoiners talk about like you knowtime preference and you know how Bitcoinchanges time preference and you knowlowers it blah blah blah and this sortof pokes at the heart of umofyou know the sort of this Confluence orthis intersection of like discussions ofmorality of discussions of you knowhuman behavior how we behave you knowhow we adapt ourselvesum you know the the discussion abouttime preference and how much we valuethe future and things like that all sortof you know hinges on this notion of uhtime preference and you can only havetime preference with certainty and youcan only have certainty when you sort ofyou know trust that something'sunchanging like you don't I don't get upout of bed and walk across thethe floor like if I didn't know forcertain that the umthat the ground would be there rightlike so you need it you need a baselevel of certainty and this ties intolike things like Maslow's hierarchiesand Tony Robbins the six human needslike you know certainty sort of like thefoundational need and you know Bitcoinsort of is we everyone talks about sortof the foundational uh essence ofBitcoin it is this foundational thingand if you want to be Foundation uh youhave to be certain certainty driven likethat's sort of the the North Star andyou know sailor has a great analogy likeBitcoin is granite right and you youwant a strong Foundation you wantGranite to build upon you don't want tobuild on quicksandum and you know to to your point whatyou're saying is like the more we tryand change it the more we turn it intosomething that is malleableum and you know it being malleable ormoldable or changeable Etc is isactually the wrong thing and you know inin doing thatlike you know we we lose the muscle thatwe build when you know kind ofconfronting something that is immovableright like and I mean you could youcould link this back to things likegoing to train at the gym right you knowlike lifting heavy weights you knowyou're you're sculpting yourself againstresistanceum and if you just went in there andlift you know spend time liftingfeathers like nothing is gonna you knowlike if you keep making the weightlighter so that you can adapt it so it'seasier for you and more comfortable andyou know sounds nice or whateverum you know you're not going to you'renot going to change you're not going toget better and that that's a that's abig risk and this is sort of ties backto what I said earlier is people need tobroaden their umtheir understandingof what Bitcoin is and you know to sortof to show my Bitcoin times publicationagain is like each year I try and likethe whole premise of why I'm doing thatis each year I want to do a themethat looks at Bitcoin through adifferent lens and you know last year'stheme was let's look at Bitcoin throughan Austrian lens and Austrian economicsthrough a Bitcoin lens because eachtheme will be a way to understandBitcoin through the theme but also lookat how Bitcoin sort of you know looksback at you right and like impacts thetheme itself and you know that's sort ofwhat we did with this Edition and youknow the previous one was sort of a newhope you know the previous one was thatPromethean Editionum you know this year we're going to dothe energy Edition you know I reallywant to do like a theology Edition youknow or sort of like a higher truthEdition you know where I want you to beinvolved and you know some other someother great thinkers in Bitcoin butyou know this sort of inquiry on bitcoinum and sort of the broadening of youknow our individual perception whatBitcoin ishopefully leads people to you know asimilar realization ofyou know maybe tinkering is not a goodidea maybe sort of the way wethink we can adapt this to usinstead of us adapting to it uh isperhaps not the right philosophyum an approach soanyway I guess that's a long way of mesaying I agree with you I think it's avery dangerous precedent to sort ofthink that uh this is this is a thing toadapt versus a thing to adapt to yeah noI think that's very well said and myfinal point on it is just that again weyou have to consider thatin your effort to speed up adoption youhave to recognize that you're you'reactually going to be changing slightlyor grossly where you end up right so ifyou if all the way along the process youforce people to take the responsibilityand to educate themselves and to do itlike whatever whatever the demands ofcurrent bitcoin are on an individual totruly adopt it if you change that thenyou're also going to wind up withdifferent individuals who have adoptedit on the other side right because let'ssay you're lowering the bar to some tosome degree in this example and so whenwe think about likethat Bitcoin future that paralleleconomy hyper bitcoinized world theBitcoin Renaissance and you know wethink about the type of people that weeither expect or would like to see therethat is highly dependent onwhat happens to this thing throughoutthat process right if you just if you ifyou continue lowering the bar in orderto accelerate adoption what do you getin the end maybe Bitcoin does survivebut you're also going to get less ofthose but I think you and I wouldperceive to be beneficial changes on anindividual level as a result of havingconfronted this thing and adopted ityou know uh withoutum what's the wordturning it into a [ __ ] participationaward like yeah exactly without withoutthe essence of what you're saying yeahyeah yeah yeah yeah yeah like thisreminds me of um compromise withoutcompromising that's what I was lookingfor yeah the this reminds me of the umthe remnant series that I did right likethe like my whole point of the remnantseries is that like we don't need todrive for Mass adoption like right nowit's like selective adoption and there'sthere should be a barrier entry you knowthere should be work that goes intopeople trying to understand Bitcoin andall that sort of stuff andum and it's fine like we shouldn't belike you know coming coming to it from aplace of sort of like desperation likeoh you know we need people to likeaccept Bitcoin you know and like acceptus as bitcoinersum because you know we're souh you know we're so right or virtuousor whatever it's like no like a lot ofpeople are like on that path totally manand like you know like real realleadership is honestly umyou know showing up by exampleum and then inspiring others throughexample to sort of want to be like youand and I I actually gave this I gave asuper impromptu talk in in Prague lastyear at the um at the Liberty in ourlifetimes conferenceand one of the things I one of thethings I said there was you know I saidyou know there's a lot of Libertarianshere a lot of people who want sort offreedom and everything like that I saidyou know instead of uh bickering andcomplaining about why how bad thegovernment and the state is I saidyou need to become the best version ofyourself and if you want other people tobe sort of libertarian andfreedom-minded[ __ ] be an example of someone otherswant to be like umand if you do that you'll have far moresuccess and long-term success thanum you knowbeing kind of that like you knowonce again it is a token libertarian thetoken libertarian right there's like thefat slob with the long hair and you knowthe shirt that you know don't tread onme right like like you know that thatdoesn't Inspire anyone right and notsaying that they're all like that butthere is a large coderight rightum that sort of behaves like that andyou know that that ain't gonna thatain't gonna Inspire anyone and you knowmaybe that sort of ties intothe shadow of Bitcoin and why I wrotethat is like you know without going onthat tangent we'll we'll do a futureinterview for that what kind of men andwomen do we want to beum what virtues do we want to embody andextolumexactly in this sort of New Era that'sgoing to emerge and um anyway you getthe you get the double you get thedouble whammy there right you get youget improvements in your own life andthe things that are meaningful to youand you you represent the most effectiveorange pill or red pill or whatever pillyou're trying to deliver simultaneouslybecause as you say I mean your resultsare what Inspire others to follow yourlead and then you doing that to yourselfis what allows you to achieve the thingsthat you want and soboth happen and I agree that they'rethey'reI mean and that's all that's thatapproach takes wisdom right because thethe impulsive thing the the immediateimmediately gratifying thing is to sayI'm right I know the solution to theproblem this is why you need to adopt itthis is what why you need to understandit and I'm the person to tell you aboutit like there's a lot of [ __ ]wrapped up in that and you can see whypeople are reject that you know that'snot a very effective strategy but theone that you outline is and to the pointabout your upcoming book Bushido Bushidowhich we will definitely have to doanother part about I think it's going tobe along those lines right it's going tobe about like that's that's what it'sabout what are the virtues and theprinciples and the valuesthat have been elucidated or Amplifiedas a result of your journey down theBitcoin rabbit hole and of course yourinvestigation of all sorts of otheryou know wisdom and historical figuresand stuff like thatthat enable one to do that to do justthatand uh soI can't wait to have a chat about uhabout that one when it's done and whenI've had a chance to read it because I'msure it's going to be greattotally I appreciate that man and yes IEcho everything you said and um and Ithink yeah this journey has just beenfantastic and honestly and I've saidthis before on you know when you're joinme on my podcast I think there's likethere's a few there's always a fewbright spots for me in like sort of theBitcoin spaceum of people that Isort of see not only eye to eye too butsort of feel likeyou know just just get get life at adeeper sense than you know you're you'redefinitely one of those like since wefirst caught up Jesus what was it like2017 2018 when we first did the firstrapid fire when I came on your show andlike well it's still like you know theselittle Bitcoin patter ones right likeinnocent we're trying to navigate whatthe hell this thing is but we we had adeep conversation and sort of like youknow Kindred Spirits in that sense andtotally yeah totally it's been a it'sbeen a fantastic journey man honestlyyeah I couldn't agree more and isn't itweird how you know time in Bitcoin justhas a differentfeel I don't know if it's sometimes likeso much seems to happen in a shortperiod of time or something that wasrecent feels like a long time ago but uhyou know 2000 I think 2019 might havebeen the first time we spoke because Ithink that's when I started the Pod buteven that on the calendar it doesn'tseem like that long ago yeah but thatconversation seems like a long time agoyou know our first chatyeah wow okay [ __ ] I didn't realize itit literally felt to me like 2017 like Ifeel like it's gonna be at least sixyears yeah exactly yeah well okay yeahthat's weird all right man I've uh takenup more of your time than I asked for soI'll let you go but any any closingremarks or final words or anything youwant to get off your channel okayumI think I would say you know I mean myguess is that most people have probablyread uncommunist but if they haven'tI'd love for them to go out check it outit's on Amazon they can pick it up it'scheapum I think also the Bitcoin times that'ssomething I've been trying to showrecently because as I said earlier Ithink getting uh these you know for methat's a project of you know qualityover quantity 21 editions of 21 yearsum you know the collectible itselfprinted 2100 times with the number onthe back and all that sort of stuff butlike this I I I themed it that waybecause I want it to represent you knowquality uh over quantity and you knoweach year has its own sort of themes andI think you know people sort of comeaway like the the first shipments ofedition five started going out um acouple weeks back in the response thatI've had from people has been phenomenallike holy [ __ ] this is the best uh pieceof Bitcoin literature I've bought or youknow I had one guy actually let me readthis message it was hilariousumhe this is such a funny messageumwhere's the Googling so he he messagesme he's like hey setsky I spent uh todayreading the Bitcoin times and there havebeen many moments where I've dropped themagazine to stare into the middledistance and contemplate what I've beenreading that's awesome my my favoriteissue is the Austrian Editionum and the content artwork and feel ofeach copy uh is qualityum he said I I have to say you know Ihad a churning feeling I don't likespending stats but they are pure signalthought-provoking andum and inspiring so anyway like I thinkyou know that sort of that sort of stufflike because there is a lot of Bitcoincontent you know like everyone's awriter today and you know everyone'swriting articles and all that sort ofstuff but you know what I've reallytried to do with this is pick the bestof the bestum you know whether it's thinkers orwhatever and compile them and you knowyou know if people want to support thatlike it's SATs onlybitcointimes.io and they can pick up apiece of you know memorabilia but alsosomething of qualityum and then yeah the last thing is um tokeep an eye out for the Bushido ofBitcoin which we were going to discuss Iwas going to do a crowdfund for it butthat turned out to be too complicatedwith the way the the publisherrelationship is with this book sothey're just gonna have to wait for thelaunch in June July and I think that maybe the most important work I've everwritten sowithout blown smoke up my ass um it's agood one and I think people will enjoyit is it going to be longer thanuncommunist yeah yeah I man I I did 60000 words in six weeks like I [ __ ]hit this one hardI just did a dump like organizing notesyesterday for what I've been writing andit's 176 000 words so farI haven't even you know there's I mean alot of that is is obviously overlap uhand there's there's much editing to bedone but uh no narrative in place yetyou know just kind ofyou know so [ __ ] I don't know who knowswhen that's gonna be a thing definitelywelcome welcome to the tough putt brothis is where yeah like are youself-publishing this one no this one I'mpublishing a Bitcoin magazine so oh coolthis one yeah this one I gave to thembecause I thought you know they canhopefully get bigger reach so let's seeit'll actually be interesting to see uhcomparing the numbers we hit at oncommunist versus these what kind ofreach can they provideI mean they've got obviously on Twitterthey have two million you know ohpromotion yeah promotions yesdistribution wise is it the sameI think distribution wise it'll besimilar they're going to get me morethan just Amazon obviously so they'llit'll be in bookshelves it'll be soit'll be quieter that way right they'vedistributed the mag and they have thoserelationships and stuff right yeah andand I wouldn't know the first thingabout how to sort of engage uh anythingbeyond Amazon so anyway like you knowI'm giving away a decent chunk for itbut hey you know like I said I'm notreally doing this for the money so forme if I can get this message out to awider audience like I would love to seethis one sell 50 000 copies and likereally sort of go I want people to sortof you know get Bitcoin standard forunderstanding Bitcoin and sort of getthe Bushido of Bitcoin for understandingwhat it means to be a bitcoiner likethat sort of time envisioning us well Isuspect it will be the first of manybooks in your collection at some pointsolike I said when it's done you'll haveto come back on and we can get deep inthe Weeds on that one for sure all rightbrother great to talk and uh take careI'll talk to you again soon as alwaysman thank you so much",
