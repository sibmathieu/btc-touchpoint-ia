money show where he engages indeep conversations with some of theworld's most prolific thinkers Robertthanks for being here for the truth manhappy to be here guys thank you forhaving me absolute pleasure one way wealways love to start these conversationsparticularly with new guests is I'd liketo dive into your own personal HeroesJourney a little bit what are the majorRites of Passage that you reallyexperienced in your life that I guessallowed and facilitated for you to bethe person that you stand here todaybeingwow that is a hell of a questionumI don't know where to beginum I guess I could justname a few things that I feel like HaveBeen instrumental in my characterdevelopment yeahumyou know I always talk um I've alwaysbeen a very curious person I've talkedabout this on other podcasts but mymymom's really pushing me towardseducation towards self-study towardsreading yeah I think that's been veryvery much uh defining for my lifeum I would also add that II guess when I was 11 years old Istarted doing I was doing wrestling andfootballand when I was actually in the offseason I was going through strengthtraining trying to condition for forwrestling and footballum there was a gentleman there named CFowler who was an Olympic weightliftercompetitive Olympic weightlifter and soI had a friend that started trainingwith him getting really good results soI started training with himand that led to thislet's see five six year career inOlympic weightlifting so I was trainingyou know twice a day morning evening Iended up competing internationally I wasvery thoroughly obsessed with the sportlike we would you know watch videosabout it all the time would drawpictures you're visualizing thetechniqueum and this sport if you've seenCrossFit like the explosive overheadlifts that people do that's what we weredoing competitively so we do snatch andcleaning jerk and yeah that seems to bevery formative in justgoal setting visualizationdiscipline you know like is a verydisciplined lifestyle and I I carry thatinto adulthood now I strive to to live apretty disciplined lifestyleumnot quite as rigorousas it was when I was a kid but you knowdoing my bestumtrying to think what else hereum I've had some really goodmentors you know somepeople that just were very effective attheir craft typically in business andum I've been fortunate enough tointeract with people that I think arethat I view as super competent in theirtheir domain of expertise andjust to be around people like that youknow to learn how they do what they doand how they thinkum they're little nuggets of wisdom thatthey're they're so kind to share hereand thereum it was all all very helpful for me Idon't know if that's exactly where youwere going with that question but I wasjustgiving you what came to mindnah man so good we appreciate itum it's it's personal to you and I thinkit's a great answerum so you host a podcast called the whatis money podcast so I know we have alimited time here but I mean is it toogeneral for me to ask you Robert what iswhat is moneyyeah it's a huge questionum one that we spend quite literallyhundreds of hours exploring on the showand umyou knowI have a document with many answers tothis question like over 50 five zeroI've blogged about several of them maybelike a dozen or soum very seemingly simple question but itdefinitely opens up into this cavernouskind of philosophical rabbit holeand ummaybe one useful way to conceptualizemoney or one of the useful framings ordefinitions is that money is thelanguage of valueand so if we try to parse that apart alittle bitlanguage somewhat obvious like wethe three of us are all running the opensource software called English right nowum this is a it's a software packageright and it only works to the extentthat we have that we share consensus onterms so when I say the wordterm right I have to assume that youhave in your mind roughly the samemeaning as I am projectingthat's what makes me lets me be able tomake noises with my face hole and youcan decrypt it in your own minds and wecan communicate right it's a verypowerful software package uh peopledon't typically think about languagethat way that it's a technology but itisum I would also add in here things likenumeracy right mathematics is anotherone of these very powerful softwarepackages that we don't think about a lotbut it's something that distinguishesman from animal in a lot of waysand somoney is the language of value uh valueis a bit of a mysterious termI think Ein Rand has a great definitionfor valueand she says value is that which manacts to gain or keepso it's the whatever we are orientinghuman action towards uh you could sayactually that any action you're takingin a particular momentis an expression of your highest valueright we all havean internalized hierarchy of preferencesor values things we want to do rightand whatever you're doing in that momentcomes at the necessary exclusion of allother things you could be doing rightaction any particular path of action ismutually exclusive to all otherpotential Paths of actionsomoney is something that iscommunicating it takes all everyone hastheir own internalized hierarchy ofvalue we're acting in the worldexpressing what we valueand money is this strange sort oflinguistic softwarethat compresses all those preferenceswhich are just they're ordinal so firstsecond third fourthit turns all that ordinal data into acardinal valuewhich is the price so you can actuallyput a numbertothe worth of something right the worthof a commoditythe net worth of an individual right ina purely economic sense soone useful way to describe money is asthissoftware package that we're all runningthat lets us transform our individuallyheld preferencesinto a collective data point that we canall Orient ourselves againstwhich is the market priceand it that sounds super abstract soI'll try to bring it down to earth alittle bitif you are a copper producerand you see that the price of coppersuddenly spikesyou don't need to know why you don'tneed to know that maybe a copper mineand Chile collapsed right the supply wascut all you need to know is that thepreferences of humans across the worldcompeting in the same Marketrelative to the supply of availablecopperhas suddenly caused that price to moveup so now you as a producer have adirect Financial incentive to producemore copper if the price goes up wellthen all of a sudden you can afford moreexotic forms of mining for instance andon the other end of the market as aconsumer when the price goes up you'reincentivized to use less or to usesubstitutes maybe you can use bronzeinstead of copper or whatever it may beso the market price is this miraculouscoordination tool that no humans need toshare a narrative or story about whathappened at all we can justmathematically Expressthe real conditions of Commodities andAssets in the world relative to thepreferences of all Market actorsand so we get this like unbelievableamount of data compression right there'sall these things in the world that areaffecting the copper industryLogistics energymining uh tariffs you know there'scountless things that influence theprice of copper but all you need to knowas a producer is that the price movedright so you get thisunparalleled capacity for datacompression and that is necessaryfor running the distributedComputing process we call the Market youhave to have accurate pricessuch that markets can satisfy humanwantswhich is to say solve problems basicallyso without money you know without thelanguage of value the market process isnot possibleand we are really reduced in ourcapacity to increase our standard ofliving to increase the satisfaction ofhuman wants to solve more problems soit's hard tooverstate how important of a tool thatis even though it can be a bit difficultto describeyeah for sure I don't know if you've gotanything to say but we can elaboratemore on this but I was just curiousbecause money is so important and yetwe've been conditioned many people havebeen conditioned to think money is theroot of all evil and so I'm curious youryour thoughts on thatyeah well let's I'm glad you bring thatup because there is a misconceptionright therethat's not what the Bible says the Biblesays the love of money is the root ofall evil not that money is the root ofall evil the Bible references moneythousands of times uh talks about theimportance of honest weights andmeasuresand if you look at Christ in particularthe story of Christright the archetypal human consciousnessright meeting betrayal with compassionand hatred with love and justjust a purely a perfect humanessentiallywhat does this what does it tell us thatthe one time Christ loses his [ __ ] inthe Bibleis on the money changers people that aretampering with the weights and measuresthey were actually using to coordinatethe market processthere's only one time that man goes intofull rage mode and it's against themoney changers which today we callCentral bankerssothat was a bit of an aside But to answerthe question in particular I would agreethatthe love of money or the love of worldlythingscan be a very reliable Pathway to evilright if you consider that evil iswillingly afflicting on someone likesomething in your own self-consciousnessyou know you would not enjoyyou know what hurt you if you willinglyinflict out on another for worldly gainright to get more stuff more food moremoney whatever it isthat seems to be a a pretty reliablePathway to evil and I think it alsospeaks tothe tremendous power of incentives toshape Human Actionandwhen I see Christ flipping out on themoney changers again if it's if money isthe language of valueit's as if you're attacking languageitselfand which is something we've seen doneby a lot of aspiring dictators acrosstime a lot of wokust and modernityuh attacking definitions like man andwoman like all of these things if youattacklanguage or money again if money'slanguage of value this is the mechanismby which we adapt ourselves to realityright reality is always changing it'sthis infinitely fluid and complex domainwe're constantly trying to adapt to itin ways that are prosperous for us rightwe're trying to satisfy more human wantsin the face of all thisuh un unknown right all this complexityif you attack the medium by which weadapt to reality which is eitherlanguage or moneyyou totally undermine the entire humanEnterprise no matter what it isso this ishow I would interpretumthe importance of money and the reasonChrist flipped out but but there's a keydifference there right it's like theimportance of a toolto appreciate and use it properly doesnot mean loving the pursuit of that toolfor its own sakesoumwe have to distinguish betweenI guess just the purpose of a tool rightthat the money will not bring youhappiness you cannot accumulate moremoney and just become Happy by virtue ofpossessing it but it is an indispensabletool for market for the market processto work and the market process is whatsatisfies human wants it's what createsInnovation and it's what creates wealthand abundance in the worldyeah I mean you mentioned you brought upAugust on Rand earlier I mean she saidthe verdict you pray you pronounce uponmoney which is the source of yourlivelihood is the verdict you pronounceupon your life you know so if we thinkof money as the means of one's survivalthen is isn't that simply a love of selfisn't isn't wouldn't that be a love ofum my potential in in terms of mypursuit of it in that regard what areyour thoughts on thatyeah I like iron Rand because she kindofshe presents this much neededCounterpoint wherea lot of people that consider themselvescompassionate orand I think we all have this to someextent not maybe not everyone but mostpeople seem to have this Generalorientation towards the world that theywould like to do good in the world rightobviously you want to do good in a waythat satisfies your own self-interest inthe process that's the ideal rightwhat's this term icky guy you guys heardof this term where it's likewhat you're good at what the world needswhat you have experience in at this thisyou know center point in this Venndiagrambut rand's making a pretty strong pointI think that self-interest is a veryimportant part of that equation youcan't just be selfless that's not enoughthere needs to be self-interestednesstoo to balanceum how things get done in the worldright you can't pour from an empty cupas some wise man once said like youcan't just be selfless there has to bea self-interested component to themarket process you look like you wantedto say something yeah I was going to saylike and if one is trying to continuallypull from an empty cup like what's thatdoing to themselves psychologically interms of building resentment guilds Etcit's like what's the real motivationwhen someone says I'm doing this out ofloveyes under the guise of selflessness oraltruism Etc but what's the truemotivation is I think is the questionthat Rand really proposed thereI agree with that and this I think it'svery pragmatic to trust humanself-interest you know it's veryreliable I don't want if someone's gonnabring me a proposal of some kind andthey're like heyI want to do this thing we're going todo all these things for you we don'twant anything in return I don't trustthat arrangement I want to know wheretheir interests lie like even if they'rebeing honest with me and totallyforthright like I the way I look at theworld I'm going to be inherentlydistrustful until I understand whattheir take issoand that's I think you can generalizethat to Market participation overallthatuh what did Adam Smith say in The Wealthof Nations that it's not the Good Willor altruism of the baker that providescustomers their daily bread he's doingit out of his own self-interestso we want a world where people pursuetheir individual self-interestwhat we also want though is for thatpursuit of individual self-interest tonotnegatively impact someone else's pursuitof their own individual self-interestso this is why I always try to hone mywork into the idea of consentthe idea of private property the idea ofinviolable ownershipso if I'm free to go out into the worldand make things of value rightplant a garden build a businessprovide you Services of any kindand you are free to do the sameand thenthe idea of private property orownership is that you then deserve byvirtue of Justice right if Justice Meanspeople getting what they deserveshouldn't you don't you deserve to keepthe things of value you yourself producethrough work or through trade I meanthat's just like the very basic premiseof private propertyand the follow-on of that isthat is the right limiting principleright this is the the proper limitingprinciple for individuals to pursuetheir own self-interest accumulate allthe assets and wealth that they wantso long as they respectthe private person and property of otherpeople that I do not acquire wealthby taking or stealing or coercing oracting violently towards anyone else Ionly engage in reciprocal consensualrelationships in exchangethat is that's what we've been trying toget to right this is the 12th 1215 MagnaCartaKing John signed the principles andexclusive scope philosophical scope ofgovernment where life liberty andinviolable propertyand that word property is so tricky I'myeah I think I'm giving up on it I thinkI'm going with ownership becauseproperty confuses people just the ideaof ownership itself thatthe actions you take in the world thatcreate things of valueyou should have the exclusive rights tothose thingsas should I as should everyone elseand we should all be left free toexchange with one another the fruits ofour labor yeahand this is what creates the economicdivision of laborthis is what allows us to become moreproductive right so we get an economywhich meanswe get more outputs per unit of inputwe accomplished greater results withless efforts like saying the same thingin a different waythat is the magic of the marketplacethat human beings operating in concertare more productive than they'reoperating in isolation but that processwill only workso long as we engage in this normativestructure of private property yeah thatyou keep what you earn I keep what Iearn like very simple but we don't havethat today like taxation is a violationof this principleinflation is a violation of thisprinciple regulation is a violation ofthis principle confiscation War by likeyou go down you can go on and on and onyeahwe have not fully implemented theprinciple of purely consensual Exchangein the world therefore we don't haveprivate property in a pure sense westill have this element of socializedproperty which is basically systemictheft and the largestinstitution of systemic theft in theworld is the Central Bank when theyprint money they're stealing assets fromthe savers of dollars and reallocatingthose assets to people getting the newlyprinted money firstand this is why I think Central Bankingis like coreto the evil in the world today yeahyeah one way I tried to I guess explainyou know the importance of privateproperty to individuals is like evenlike in a hunter-gatherer situation if Iwas to you know forage my own fruit foodor you know my own meat or whatever itmight beand someone else comes along and claimsto have a right to that that's actuallythreatening my survival because thatprivate property is the meat is down themeans of my survival right the means ofmy production is a means of my survivaland ultimately that threat is theCornerstone of slaveryyes oh you I mean taking the words outof my mouth in a wayI would Define a slave as someone whohas a 100 effective tax ratewhich means that all the fruits of theirlabordo not belong to them they go They're100 taxed and yeahtaken by a taxing Authorityon the other end of that Spectrumsomeone which we don't really have manysomeone's with a zero percent effectivetax rate but we do have SovereignNations right the United States doesn'tpay tax to anyone elseit has a zero percent effective tax ratewell we refer to countries today nationstates as sovereigns for that reasonso you can now plotthe plight of modern man right on thatSpectrum what is your effective tax ratethat's what percentage of a slave youare and like it's it's a bitter pill toswallow and people hate they resist itlike what do you mean who's going tobuild the roads who's going to do thiswho's going to do thatum we could you know first of allgovernment doesn't build roads they hireprivate contractors they spend stolenmoney to do itit's somewhat obvious that you're goingto beless careful with money that you didn'tearn I mean we just know thisvery basically and also like in yeah inLas Vegas they call this a free rollright if someone's going to give you themoney to gamble on the craps tableyou're just going to take a really highrisk because you have no skin in thegame right you didn't earn that moneythe same is true when someone's spendingstolen proceedsthey don't have any skin in that game soit's very easy to be profligate youmight sayand I would just like to highlight oneother component to this thatwe often talk about private propertyrights which again I'm going to just gowith ownership is kind of a better termfor thatvery seldomly do we stop to considerthat private property rights are the oneside of the same coinof private property responsibilitiesbecauseif you basically what we're saying iswhen you have ownership in an asset youown a car rightyou have the exclusive right to enjoythe features of that caryou also have the exclusive right toexclude others from enjoying thefeatures right you can say maybe you'llgive your friend a ride that's nice ofyou to do but you can also not give theguy the homeless guy that wants to jumpin your car ride you have the right tosay noum if you want to keep enjoying thefeatures of that asset in this case anautomobileyou must also consider that you aresimultaneously responsiblefor taking care of that asset for formaintenance and upkeep on the automobilesowhen we debase currency or we engage intaxation not only are we destroyingindividuals rights or individualownership over the means to theirsurvival as you described but you'realso deprecatingresponsibility itself yeah you know thisis this is ancient Aristotle said thisif you take it to the extreme Aristotlesaid when everyone owns everythingnobody takes care of anythingthere's no incentive for individuals totake care of assets when you've justsocialized ownership to the state or oreveryone owns it you know it's it'spublic propertythat's equivalent to destroying anyincentive to take it take care of itwhatsoever and I think I mean this is atangent butyou could read rothbard on this in theethics of Libertyhe makes a strong argument thatimproving the Integrity of ownership isactually the solution to theenvironmental crisisbecause what happens right now is youhave these areas of the world like theocean that are not privately owned rightthese are justum this is the tragedy of the Commons atscaleprofitable to just throw your pollutionin the ocean for many companies becauseno the ocean doesn't sue you the oceandoesn't do anything about it right itjust takes the garbagebut ifwe assume that the entire world wasprivately owned by individuals rightthat we had thisthese property rights andresponsibilities traceable down to anindividual levelnow if you decide to dump pollution inthe ocean or my my parcel of the oceanor maybe it's into my river that I willactually sue you right I will I will Iwill come after you right and thatforces you as a would-be polluter to nowconsider the cost of pollutionwhereas if there's no one to do that ifthere's just this public property thatno one's going to sue you for dumping onyou don't have to worry about that youjust dump the pollution and move on soto force producers to impute the cost ofpollution into their operationsmy argument which I'm I'm echoing frommothbard is you need really strongprivate property really you need fullprivate ownership of the means ofproduction and and ownership ofresources in the world simply putthere's no motivation to care or protectfor anything if it belongs to no oneprivate property rights you to baseprivate property responsibility yeahthat's a big point I'm curious how wouldthat go about in your view to be to likeauction off parts of the Pacific Oceanlike how would that look in actualitybecauseit's pretty largeit's pretty large and you know you couldsay that maybe justby virtue of technological reality wehaven't done it yetumbutyou know look how much uproar there isamong environmentalists uh like LeonardoDiCaprio right what is he his number onething in life is let's clean up theoceanI don't think it's a feasible Ventureuntil you really think about theeconomic incentives involved withcaretakingcare of something like the ocean rightit's three quarters of the Earth'ssurface it's massive if you don't givesomeone Financial skin in the game andincentive to take care of it it's notgoing to get done you cannot do thiswith legislation or law it will neverhappenand I mean that's my opinion it'ssomewhat radical because mostenvironmentalists think we need moregovernment more legislation moreTaxation and I'm advocating for theexact opposite it's like no you needless violations of private property muchstronger ownershipand this just natural incentive toenjoy the features of something but onlythat's something that you take care ofright and that thatit's important to always remember thatwe use all these abstractions todescribe ourselves right nation statescompaniesuhconservative liberal like all thesedifferent groupings we put ourselves inbut at the end and the ultimate finalanalysis of reality it's individualsacting in the world individuals decidingwhat means to use to pursue what endsthere's no United Nations making adecision there's no United States makinga decision it's individuals that areactingso we have tocurate our incentive structure forindividualsit's it's a hypothetical but I think thebasis of the argument is correct youknow I mean I can just speak for myselfas well like I grew up working in familybusinessesum and in in that in that kind ofsituation regardless of how much inputone individual hasumyou're working towards a common goal sothe incentive isn't relative to my inputnow as an entrepreneur the amount ofwork I do you know is is equivalencewhat I'm going to receive as wellwhereas in that situation previously thepie is going to be cut the same wayum regardless in in the one the commonmachine so to speakso I cared far less about my effortright you I got cared far less about youknow how focused I was about howefficient I was about how effective Iwas but now when I wear your totalresponsibility you know more of anentrepreneurship role now theneverything's I care far more abouteverything right I do the best that Ipossibly canum all the time becausebecause of the incentive theresponsibility also um is far moreimportant to me as well obviously100 this is why I love the wordownership over property yeah becauseit's applicable Beyond just theeconomics domain like we want to takeownership of the things we've done inlife rightpeople will say this often like if youmake a mistake just own ityou know or or often I've heardentrepreneurs say they want theiremployees to think like owners right youwant your staff to think like owners youhave to make this ideathis this idea of just an ownershipmentality I think it's so important ifwe really want if we actually care aboutthe ecological preservation of our worldthen you want people to act like ownersin that world you want your staff 8billion people that we are we wantpeople that take an ownershiprelationship with nature and it's It'stricky because peopleyou know this this very leftist woke usthing almost views people as like aparasite on the planet and they're likeoh we need less people and more liketell people what to doum it's very anti-human I guess it isthe view that I'm trying to orient I'mthe Counterpoint I'm trying to make isthe metrics should be human flourishingfirst and foremost and I think theproper means to the end of humanflourishing is this symmetry of Rightsand responsibility that's enshrined inthe ancient principle of privateproperty that would be my argument yeahwell I mean in all of life in all ofnature like the most important thing isthat organisms survivalso yes of course socialism is theanti-life when you look at it throughthat lens rightand socialism is a policy ofinstitutionalized aggression againstprivate property that's how it isproperly defined it'sagain we could sayproperty is a bad word I'm still tryingto get away from it but I'm stuck inthat that Paradigm it's individualizedprivate property or it's socializedpublic property yeahand it's a spectrum the closer you moveto individualized ownership the moresymmetry of Rights and responsibilitieswe havein the world the more easily I candiscernthat my self-interest stops where yourself-interest begins right we mediateconflicts over resources via privatepropertybut to the extent that we move oppositeon that Spectrum towards socializedpublic property there's no symmetrywe've obfuscated the whole thing andwhat ends up happening is you getSoviet Russia yeah right you get thestate owning everything andextremely bad outcomes for humanflourishing yeahand also like the mentality of you knowthe people that systems like that breedare those that feel within themselvesthat they're unable to produce they feelas though they have nothing great tooffer you know they feel media will goin in generalso you know what's what what's the kindof psychological symptom of pushing thatkind of symptom on individuals as wellum you know if one if one believes thathow much they receive is equivalent totheir need as opposed to theirproductionI I think you're intuiting somethingvery important here I haveum an episode with Matthias Desmond hewrote a book called the psychology oftotalitarianismum really focusing on mass psychosis howhow it happens the the problems with itEtcand we had a really good discussionabout this very thing like how theviolation of private property or thesocialization of property can actuallycontribute to mass psychosisis one of the things he describes inthere a lot is that people losing touchwith realityright and as we kind of describedlanguage earlierit's a tool we're using to stay in touchwith reality both describing objectivereality and communicating aboutsubjective realityif that tool doesn't work then obviouslywe're going to be out of touchI think you could look at again we saidmoney was something the language ofvalue when you debase money you'reviolating private property so you'reyou'rethis this communication system that'sintended toshare accurate messages to to facilitateadaptationwhen that's under attack people areliterally losing touch with realityyeah right like you're actually not likeyou go to perform an action and youexpect a certain roughlya result within a certain uh span ofvalues but that action the feedback isnot there you're not getting properfeedback so I think there's a deep pointto be made that the more rapidly weviolate private propertyor ownership yeahthe more quickly we drive ourselvesinsane individually and collectivelyyeah and umwell I mean you made you made thecorrelation between money and languageearlier it's like a distorting you know50 of the English language or takingaway 50 of the words right exactly it'slike the ability to communicate is goingto be incredibly centered yeah and whenyou look at the ascent ofauthoritarians let's say historically oraspiring authoritariansthe first two things this can't be acoincidence right the first two thingsthey need to control to start to castthis spell over the people is they haveto control the press the media yeahand they have to control the money yeahso again they have to control theselinguistic tools by which people adaptto reality and see through [ __ ]if I'm going to be a dictator and putyou in my little private realm of[ __ ] where I'm the god king andyou're all my peons I need to stop thosetwo tools from workingso it you know it's a bit abstract butman I can't I just don't think that's acoincidenceno not thoughumyou mentioned inflation earlier I feellike that's something that many peopleare very confused about can you give uslike a simplistic understanding of whatinflation isyeah this is another one of those termskind of like property and you know maybesome of this terminological confusion isa result of us living inside of a stateParadigm because we've been conditionedright that prices should just go up andthat's a good thing and that's good foryou and it's good for the economy andthat house you bought in 1980 is worthyou know five times as many dollars onpaperbut what is being hidden by all of thatisthe depreciation of the purchasing powerof each unit of moneyyeah sothis is a very long topic but I'm goingto try to summarize it as best that Icanmoney's a technology that humansselect right just like we always selectanytool the right tool for the job we'realways looking for a better tool for thejobso we've gone from you know carrierpigeons to smoke signals to Telegraph todigital Communications rightsame aim we just really want tocommunicate with one another acrossspace and time but better tool for thejob so we adopt better and better toolswhen it comes to money one of the thingsyou really want is that whateverwealth whatever whatever you sacrificeto obtain that moneyright assets you would sell for moneyyou would trade you would sell your farmfor money right the expectation is thatthat money would hold its purchasingpower across timeso that you could hold on to that moneyfor five years and then five years laterexchange it for a farm of roughly equalvalue yeah at best rightso when humans were selecting the besttool for the job when it comes to moneygold became money through this processand the reason isno matter how much time effort or energyhumans allocated towards gold productionthe supply of gold increased the mostslowlywhich is to say its Supply was the mostresistant to debasementor inflation right the inflation of thegold Supply andthe people get hung up here to say soI'll try to expandwhen you increase the numberwould you increase the units of gold youincrease the supply of goldyou are effectively diluting the claimsthe purchasing power of gold for thepeople saving in it and this is true ofany money right so iflet me try to give this analogy the TheBabe Ruth baseball card analogy ifthere's 100 Babe Ruth baseball cards inthe worldeach one's worth uh ten thousand dollarsyeahevery time say someone discovers orfinds out oh there's actually an extra50 Babe Ruth baseball cards right or anextra 100 or whatever it may be you'renow compromising the Rarityof that baseball cardand what we would say the theanalogous point in money would be you'recompromising the scarcity of the moneyor the supply integrityumyou're compromising the capacity ofmoney to hold value across time becausethere's more units being producedthat are diluting the savings ofexisting saverssoI hope that made sense and then thereason gold is selected is because it'sthe leastthe the asset that is most resistant todebasementthat no matter how hard we try toproduce more of it it's the thing we canproduce most slowly so if I park myeconomic value or wealth in this money Iknow the highest degree of certaintyI'm not going to be no one's going toinflate it or print more gold or whathave you so gold becamethe global Premier store value for thatreason it's the most inflation resistantasset in the worldnowum problem with goldis that it's physicalso it's very hard to carry aroundphysical gold and transact day-to-dayand physical gold so we needed to putall the gold in one place and have thatcustodian issue paper notes that wereredeemable for the gold so we couldtrade more easily with each othernow what we had with gold when I saidit's inflation resistant is we hadan asset that's really good at holdingvalue across timerightholds purchasing power across time thisis one of the core properties of moneyit's a good definition for moneyactually another one a tool for movingvalue across space and time so gold wasreally good at the time dimensionsuffered in the space Dimension it'sphysical it's heavy you've got to secureit you know it's cumbersome to use howare you going to buy a cup of coffeewith gold it's like gold dust you knowthere's too much value density per unitof goldso we need to decentralize the custodyand issue paper on top of itso that we could get a monetarytechnology that was good for movingvalue across space right I can now movethis paper claim on gold across spacevery easyuh and when that that paper claim becamean electronic claimit became even easier to move the moneyacross space so with a gold-backedcurrencywe had successfully augmented money suchwe had a good tool for holding valueacross timein Gold but we had this currency layersoftware layer put on top of it calledcurrency so we could move it acrossspace effectivelythis works wonderfully this works greatholds value across time and moves valueacross space easilyproblem isis that we introducedwhat we call in markets counterpartyriskbasically means that you need to trustthat custodian that's holding the goldnot to violate the contractand print more units of currency thanthey have actual gold and Reservesthat's the core problem with thegoldback currency and it is that exploitthat has been taken advantage of timeand time and time again you just can'ttrust human nature to manage the moneysupplysoinflation properly understood today iswe got all the gold moved into a bank weissued paper on top of it I'm going togloss over a lot of history here by 1971Nixon had revoked the gold standardso that the paper currency that the USdollar was no longer redeemable for goldand I'm going to skip some Nuance herebut we've now moved into this worldwhere we think that government paper inour pocket is moneyit's no longer redeemable for gold orany other commodity so all we actuallyhave in our pocket is auncollateralized debt from thegovernmentand because the money is not redeemablefor anything specifically goldthis givesthe Federal Reserve which is the CentralBank of the United States and its and byextension it's Commercial Banking armsthe capacity to print new moneyadd infinitum that you can just printnew units of paper as many new units ofpaperas the market will Bear right you'relending them into existence you'rebuying in the case of the FED they'rebuying U.S government debt which aretreasuries they're and then thegovernment is spending that money intoexistence the money goes into Banks it'sit's lent on top of so the money supplyexpands even morebut at the basis of all this isthis divorce from economic reality thatthe money is no longer money we'vedivorcedcurrency for money right you know thatthe currency is no longer redeemable forgold which is moneyand this has becomea real problem right this is basically asource of Limitless revenue forgovernmentsand my simplest way to capture all ofthat in one little phrase that'sresonated with peopleand it's the proper way to understandinflation in my opinionis that inflation is legalcounterfeitingand counterfeiting is Criminal inflationthere's no actual mechanical differencein the two things right the crime thatGeorge Floyd for instance rightcounterfeit 20 bill is why he was ainitially in custody I think with thepolicethat is the exact same action that theFederal Reserve the Central Bank of theUnited States perpetrates by thetrillionright there's there's no mechanicaldistinction between these two thingsonly a legal one it's only a matter ofwhich way the guns are pointedsoand andthat is the proper way to understand itthat the world the problem with theworld in my estimationis that we are governedbyan institutionalized system of currencycounterfeitingand if one group of people can justproduce new units of money that everyoneelse is forced to use as we are forcedto use the US dollar and other Fiatcurrencies through legal tender throughCapital controls through othercompulsory meansthen you have given those individualsthat can print money have the licenseand ability to steal human time effortand energy and all the products they'refromso this is the big problem in the worldthat we havein a supposedly free market capitalisticWestwe have an anti-capitalistic institutionat the heart of every modern economycalled the central bank that's used toperpetrate systemic theftand all of everything that I just saidis wrapped in this pseudoscience calledKeynesian economicsthat justifies the monopolization ofmoney in the printing of money it sayswe actually need it right this is whythis is even the term inflation itselfis a euphemismit's you're diluting the value of theassetthe only thing that's inflating as aresult is the nominal price rightit takes more dollars to buy the samething so the price goes up on paper butwhat you don't see is the purchasingpower of each unit each dollar beingdiminished yeah and it is thiscognit I call this a cognitive opticalillusionthat people just see the number going upright stocks go up houses go up goldlike assets just keep going up in dollarpriceit disguises the actual the debasementof purchasing power and people just fallfor it people have been falling for itfor a long timebutyou know studying the history of moneywill tell you pretty quickly that thatillusion does not last forever I meanyou can't fool economic reality foreverand eventually currency is hyperinflateor economies fail as a result of thisdistortionso um and this is where Bitcoin is verypassionate just saying like lookwe need money that

discount code read loveyeah that was my next question it waslike if we continue down this path it'sbeen going on for so long where do yousee this heading what do you see as therealityum of the west of the United States andhow is Bitcoin the answer or one of theanswerswell I would like to take a page out ofyour guys book actually and talk aboutthe nature of Truthumyou know we talked about priceDistortion a little bit earlierwhen you start printing money basicallyit becomes more difficult to understandwhether a price change was a result ofsupply and demand changingor if this isa consequence of the printing of moneyright you can't now I can't tellin a world where money is beingmonopolize and debased whether thisprice signal is telling me there's areal demand in the marketplace the pricewent up because people really wantedthis thingor if there's just a central bank policythey just changed the amount of dollarsit creates distortions in thisinformation systemnowthere's a saying on Wall Street thatprice is truthI think there's a lot of potency in thatsaying because again you'reyou're taking all the preferences of thehumans in the world and all theavailablesupply of the commodity whether it'scopper or whatever it is and you'resaying this is the number right copperis I'm picking a number out of the air Idon't know what copper is actuallypriced at a hundred dollars an ouncethat's the truth of that asset rightthat's what it's taking everyone'swishes and superimposing them onto theavailable supply of copper in the worldand it gives you one numberlike there's a lot of data andinformation in that one numberandone of the definitions of truth Ilearned from the American pragmatistsI think this was purse it may have beenJamessaid that truth is found at the end ofinquiryand so there's a subtle distinction herewhere we again trapped in language wetalk about truth like it's just ohthere's just there's a truth out therethat you could knowbut the reality is I think thatthis huge fluid complex universe is muchmore complicated than anything we couldever fit between the yearsso in the pragmatist As I understood itkind of made this point that there'sthere's the capital T truth which islike the reality the Ultimate Reality ofeverything that isthat's beyond human comprehension onmultiple levelswhat we need to worry aboutfor pragmatic reasons is the nature ofthis pragmatic truth which is likewe can keep inquiringdeeper and deeper and deeper there'sthis intelligibility to reality that wecan inquire into and get closer to thatcapital T truth even if we can neverreach itwe can develop a a more pragmaticrelationship with truth let's sayand sothis idea of debasingmoney is actually destroying the pricethe truth seeking mechanism the truthDiscovery mechanism of markets so ifprice is truth price Discovery is truthDiscovery for pragmatic Reasons I'm notsaying we're getting to Ultimate capitalT truth here but pragmatic truth emergesthrough the market processum another more obvious definition ofTruth would just be like an accurateportrayal of realityright so as we've sort of alluded toearliermoney is meant to be a representation ofhuman time and energyright this one's fairly obvious that youwhy do you go to work right you go toworkto spend your time and energy onsomething that's serving others in somecapacitythat's a consensual exchange of yourtime and energy for moneythe money that you receive you thenexpect to be able to go back out intothe market to a restaurant on a vacationto buy a car whatever it isand you want to be able to trade thatrepresentation of your time and energycalled moneyor the time and energy of other peopleright to build the caryour meal whatever it may beso the when we talk about truth being anaccurate portrayal of reality money isthisXC tool we use to trade human time andenergytime and energy are fixed for each of usright they're strictly finite we onlyhave so much time and so much energywhen you engage in a currencycounterfeiting Monopoly that's justproducing new units of money it's theequivalent to an institution printingnew time and energy for itselfwhile diluting everyone else right againit's another angle on that that aspectof systemic theft that the central bankum perpetrates soI would argue like okay we havethe basement of currency destroyingtruth as the end of inquiry in themarket process it's interrupting andconfusing the market processit's debasing the time and energy thatmoney is intended to represent rightthat you put your hard Your Blood Sweatand Tears into this thing you want to beable to redeem it for something of equalvaluewell currency counterfeiting diminishesthat tooandanother definition of truth I think isreally apt here is uh Heidegger so thetruth is unconcealednessthat which cannot be concealed right wethe the all-encompassingyou know uhnature of Ultimate Reality in a way andit's always there to be like you can'tnecessarily perceive it or understandbut truth is unconcealed truth isall-encompassing truth is wholesomething like that you know and sothis gets a bit into the Bitcoin thingbut like that what we have today withCentral Bank currency counterfeitingit's a black boxyou don't know how many dollars are incirculation you don't know how manydollars will be in circulation you don'tknow the criteriafor Central Bankers deciding uhwe don't know who profits from it wedon't know who owns essential Banksright there's it's a black box you don'tsee anything totally concealedand now the opposite of Central Bankingthis purely opaque dark thing is BitcoinBitcoin is justlanguage it's just open like there'snothing hidden inside of it it's opensource softwaremeaning thatevery aspect ofits protocol is inspectable andobservable to anyoneright this is the nature of Open SourceTechnologies you can literally examinethe source code down to the letterthere's not even an opportunity toconceal anything it's absoluteunconcealednessso when I look at fiat currency I seethis institution destroying thetruthfulness of money right destroyingprice discoverydestroying individual rights to thefruits of their time and energyand it's done through opacity andconcealedness right which is thedestruction of heidgarian Truthand then over here in Bitcoinwe're talking about something that's uhyou can inquire into it as much as youwant it's open source softwareit has a fixed Supply so it perfectlyrepresents the supply Integrity of yourtime and energy that you are sacrificingto obtain itand then the protocol itself isinspectable and observable by anyone soit's it is unconcealedness it's theultimate implementation ofunconcealedness it's open sourcesoftware sotry to take this all the way back to theoriginal question where is the Westgoing I meanguys the the study of monetary historyis really Bleak in this regard like onceyou start debasing currencymises wrote about this in the 40s thereare only two possible outcomesand this is not empirical this is a thisis a rigorous theoretical deduction youhave only two possible outcomes once youstart to debase currencyit either you keep debasing it until youhyperinflate itor you stop the basing at some point andyou have this giant crash back toeconomic realityand now if we move out of thetheoretical domain into the empiricalwhat have humans done alwaysthey've always given into thattemptation to just keep printing rightit's justit's like a it's a drug addiction thatwe thinkthis little bit of you know where uhWe've fallen on economic Hard Timesthere's not enough money to go aroundwe'll print just a little bit tostimulate the economy in Big Air quotesand that'll get us going again and we'llget moving well once you start to quoteunquote stimulate the economy what areyou actually doing you're distortingprices you're causing Capital to bemisallocated you're violating privateproperty rights you're confusing themarket processso it sows the seeds for the nextdisaster which is even worseand then that is used as an excuse forprinting even more moneyand the cycle repeats until the currencycollapses and when the currencycollapsessocial cohesion goes away right look atstudy the nature of hyperinflationsor just think to yourself if the moneystopped working right now how manypeople could you actually deal with inthe worldhopefully you have a small circle oftrust right family friends you couldmaybe get on with but beyond that smallcircle of what 10 15 12 maybe you've gota hundred people whatever maybe you'rethe coolest guy in the world you've got150 best friendsthere's still eight billion other peopleyou can'tinteract withwhen the money breaks soI feel like this whole conversation cankind of be correlated it's like you knoweven psychological Shadow work rightlike you you so a lie you act againstthe cell you do harm to another it'sgetting further and further and furtheraway from the truthand so by the time you try to recoverlike the the process is going to be deepdark and Incredibly more difficult andthere's this increasing build of thefear of facing all the darkness offacing all the lives that have sowed orfacing it all and so we just keep addingon top of it more makeup moreself-sabotage more whatever it might beto get away from you know the volatilitywhich is actually going to bring us backthe homeostasisI think it's a beautiful I wouldn't evensay it's an analogy I mean I thinkI thinkfractals are the geometry of natureright so things are self-similar atdifferent scales basically so whenyou're describing Shadow work at theindividual levelwhat else would we expect the collectionof all the individuals to behave likeyou know other than something like amacrocosmic individual in a wayand umthis also gets into the nature ofaddiction itself I said addictionearlier but I mean that with withit's you know I had a cognitivescientists on the show John ravaki hespeaks to this much more intelligentlythan I canbut he describes the nature of actualaddiction as the process of reciprocalnarrowingand so you know rough exampleuma man with alcoholic Tendencies has abad day at workso he goes home and he has a couple ofdrinks right well then he's hung overthe next day he shows up late for workthat snowballs into a thing with hisboss he's in even more trouble has aneven worse day at workso he goes home and he has a you know afew more drinks than he had the nightbeforeand it's a very simplified example ofobviously but that is kind of the shapeof addiction that youyou build this little monster inside youthat justifiesmore of the substance right despite itactually causing negative things in yourlife right you're trying to you'retrying to put the Band-Aid on thenegative things in your lifebut the the attempt to put the Band-Aidon is the actual Genesis of the problemsor the exacerbation of the problemsrightand it culminates you know in the guyeither in rehab or dead in a ditchsomewhereand it's very structurally similar tothe printing of money as I describedearlier it's like you print a little bitof money to try and fix the economicproblem you cannot fix an economicproblem with printing money because allyou're doing is shiftingthis is a key Point too it's notcreating any new wealth if I create newpieces of paper called dollarsI haven't created any new factoriesequipment knowledge I haven't satisfiedany human wants I have just shiftedownership of wealth from the hands ofpeople saving in dollarsinto the hands of those receiving thenewly printed dollars first so it's justtheft it can't you can't solve problemsby stealingyeah and this it's an addiction rightit's a self there's a self-deceptionelement to it where we we're like we'reliterally yeah and but but the peoplethat run the world today are telling uswe needed to print six trillion dollarsbecause of a pandemic the past two yearsif you don't just stop and sit with thatfor a few minutes and realize howasinine and insane that isyeah and the addiction is perpetuated byour adversity to painyes yesabsolutely absolutely yeah it's youit's an analgesic right you're runningfrom the painright you're taking that next drink oryou're printing that you're engagingthat next round of quantitative easingtrying to kick the can down the road andStave off the pain and all you're doingis exacerbating the ultimate andinevitable Day of Reckoningyeah we're going to print some moremoney that's right that's exactly rightyeah it's um it's unbelievable so like Iyeah yeahlast thing I would say about that justagain check out the episode withverveiki yeah the opposite of thereciprocal narrowing of addictionis the reciprocal opening of Love yeahwhen you're engaged in a real authenticrelationship with someone you want toopen up more and be more vulnerable andshow them The Good the Bad and the Uglysuch that they feel more comfortable andconfident to Now open up to you more andyou can know them more deeply for thepurposes of them knowing you more deeplylike it's this equal and oppositebeautiful Force it's so true because ifyou think about that even justsocio-politically if someone got on TV apolitician or someone was like Heylisten you know we [ __ ] up the lastcouple years you know there's somethings that we thought were were goingto be a certain way and they weren't andlike you know we're gonna try to bebetter now granted they could be justmanipulating but who does that like youknow how often do you see a politicianor or or CEOExpress that levelexcuse me that level of vulnerabilityno I agree completely and Iyou know I'll just share this and it Inever know where to go in theseconversations because I've been goingdown this rabbit hole for so long youdon't know you know where to meet theaudience exactly but my current Viewis that there's a deep continuitybetween the complex systemthat is the individual human beingand the complex systemof networked human beings we call theglobal economy right there's a deepcontinuity between kind of like thefractal thing we're just described likeThe Dark Night of the Soul or forget howyou put it that an individualShadow work there's some manifestationof that in a global economic sense wellI mean it's the great hermetic Principleas above so below as within so withouthas it right yes perfectand you know what is then facilitatingthe exchange between the micro and themacroand if I'm looking at the answer to thatquestion and just an economic sense theanswer is moneyright like language matters too butwhat do we say actions speak louder thanwordswe understand thatwell what is capital right Capital likethe actual stuff we're making is theresult of many thousands of actionsso it's one thing for me to say I'll putmoney into a dealit's another thing for me to sign thedocument right that's a much highersignal that oh I'm probably going to putmoney in the deal but you're not goingto countmoney in that deal until the money hitsthe account and it can't be reversedright the check clears or the theBitcoin settles whatever it may besothere's a very strong signalingmechanism that we'rewe're tampering with we're tamperingwith the money and it's it createsfeedback I think psychologically peopleare more likely to engage inself-deception yeah you know you couldget it like in Bitcoin circles we talkabout Fiat food Fiat medicine Fiatcultureright there are near apparently nearubiquitous but definitely pervasiveeffects from the corruption of money ittends to corrupt everything that ittouchesand you know I think if you just take alook around the world today you'd behard-pressed to find a betterexplanation for what's going onwell I I I see it simply as a magnifieryou know it simply magnifies what thatindividual already is is what kind ofwhat kind of qualities the level oftheir character that they've actuallydeveloped within and you knowwhen even like they had this wholeconcept of welfare all we're doing isdistorting the reality principle we'redistorting the relationship betweenrights and responsibility which isobviously as we've discussed thefoundation of us solving anything in inreality I guess yeahI agree with you that there's amagnifying effect right that um andmoney has this effect right it uhsomeone's described it as kind of likealcohol thatif you're kind of naturally ahappy-go-lucky person and you have a fewdrinks well you tend to be a little bitmore happy-go-lucky but if you'rebrooding and dark inside and you have afew drinks it sort of amplifies yourpersonality in that wayI'm a littlehesitant to leave it at just that thoughbecause I think of people growing up andsituations of extreme depravity orpoverty you know right that where you'rekind of like forced into survival it'slike steel or starve kind of thing andso that there is this element ofvalues being imposed upon you throughincentives you could say yeahand so it's not just like maybe that kidthat's stealing instead of starvingmaybe he has really goodness in hisheart right he whatever he could be thenext Mother Teresa the next Steve Jobsyou don't knowbut when he's forced into this situationof economic dispossessionhis character development path can gooff course by no fault of his own rightcould just be the worldand so there you know there's thisfeedback I guess he's also responding tothe corrupt system right that's one ofthe solution in the system yeah sosometimes I get into these conversationswith people like well you just need tofix the individuals I'm like I don'tthink you can just fix the individualsthere's also the systemic angle like ifwe could decorupt money or whatever thatmeans you know just move on to a Bitcoinstandard thenremove theft from the global economythen maybe we would there'd be thatfractal reflection in the individualright people would be less thievingoverall yeah so where does the what doesBitcoin receive its value from you knowwe're talking about the gold standardand superimposing money like how doesthat concept work in for Bitcoinyeah it's a great questionum againwe're going to compress a lot into notso many minutes here but yeahone of the ways I've explained why goldbecame moneyand this is actually a great answer oneof the most useful answers to thequestion what is moneywhat properties are they seeking in thetool called money over timeandI've spoken at length about this inseveral places so I'm just going tobriefly go through it butmy interpretation of what people seek ingood money is they want something thatis divisible durable recognizableportable and scarce those are the fiveproperties of good moneythat's why gold was selectedbecausebasically over a whole history ofexperimentation it was determined thatmonetary Metals best satisfied thoseproperties they were the best tool forthe jobsilver bronze gold of the monetaryMetals gold was the most scarceas we said earlier meaning that nomatter how hard we tried to increase itsSupply its Supply was the most resistantto inflationor the least flexible right you couldn'tchange the supply that much that made ita very useful store value Assetit also highlights where gold sufferedright gold is not portable not thatportable relative to paper dollars orelectronic dollars that's much moreuseful for transacting across space aswe described earliersowhat made gold good money is that peopleconsensually selected it as the righttool for the job just the best tool wehad for moneyum you know I specifically say agold-backed currency as we describedearlier if you could trust Human Natureif we weren't sinful corruptablecreatures goldback currency would workgreatbut human fallibility being what it isyou can't trust humans to safeguard themoney supply so if we takethat framing for why gold became moneyit had the most divisibility durabilityrecognizability portability scarcity andwe apply that to an examination ofBitcoinBitcoin is infinitely divisibleone Bitcoin right now is divisible into100 million subunits called satoshi'sum the software protocol can be updatedin a backwards compatible way toincrease that divisibility further so itbasically has infinite divisibilityBitcoin is perfectly durable in thesense that it's just distributedinformationthe example I like to cite here is theBibleyou can burn as many physical copies ofthe Bible as you wantbut that will do nothing to destroy theBible itself right the Bible is thisdistributed set of information that isso deeply permeateduh the collective human consciousnessthat it's not going anywhere right itit's just pure distributed informationright bitcoin's the same it's just everynode of Bitcoin is running and theentirety of its history you could stampout as many nodes as you want but everytime someone else boots up the softwarethey have the whole history of Bitcoinright thereumobviously in terms of portabilityBitcoin way outperforms gold because Imean that was a big drawback with goalsas we said earlier but Bitcoin beingjust digital information you can move itat the speed of lightcan't get much more more portable thanthat in this universerecognizabilityhas to do withauthenticating the veracity of the moneyso you may have heard the term soundmoneythis was in regard to the sound goldwould make when you dropped it from acertain height it gave a very particularresonance and thisum gave Credence to its authenticitythat it wasn't you know lead paintedgold things like thisthere were also these techniques calleda saying people used to assay golda-s-s-a-y and they would just you knowdo these certain measurement techniquesto make sure it was gold basicallyum Bitcoin has this radically newfeature set for recognizability that youcan audit the total Supply so just byrunning a nodeyou can audit the whole world you cansay what's the actual total supply ofBitcoin and like spoiler alert theanswer is always less than 21 millionright that's the most Bitcoin there canever be is 21 millionand soit's totally resistant to counterfeitingright I don't need to rely on the sounda Bitcoin makes when I drop it or likeyou know some little calipermeasurements of the Bitcoin well thereis no physical Bitcoin but you can knowwith certainty right that the Bitcoinyou have is yours and that it's aguaranteed fraction of a total supply of21 million so you know no one can debaseyou through inflationand that leads into the final propertywhich is scarcity itselfum I I want to be very particular herescarcityoccurs wherever demand exceeds Supplysowhen there's more wants for a thingthere are there are of the thing to goaround people need to compete for itand they compete for it through themarket process basicallyit's different than valueobviously oxygen very valuable to humanlife but there's no price on it why isthat because there's so much Supply inthe atmosphere that the supply exceedsthe demand so oxygen is freeummoney is kind of interesting when itcomes to scarcity because since moneylays claim to everything elseit's basically always scarce as aconcept at least people always want moremoney because money can be used toobtain anything that the market can cangenerateso what we really want and what wereally mean when we say scarcity or whatI mean when I say scarcity of money isI'm talking about the Integrity of thesupplyagain this is why gold was favored asmoney historically it had the mostintegral most predictable Supply overtime so I know that whatever fraction ofgold that I own I won't be debasedand with Bitcoin we've perfected thatright you can know with perfectcertaintythat if you hold 100 Bitcoin you have a100 out of a possible 21 million foreverthere's no one that can ever do anythingabout that and that's better than goldtoo becausewe don't know the future of gold rightwe could figure out we could mine OceanFloors we could mine asteroids we couldfigure out how to make gold more costeffectively in a lab all of these thingscould compromise its Integrity as astore of valueand same is not true for Bitcoin rightthere's no way to increase the supply atleast no one's figured out how you couldpossibly increase the supply of BitcoinBeyond 21 million soI think with BitcoinSatoshi has effectively invented avirtually perfect money right infinitelydivisible durable recognizable portableand perfectly scarcethanks for sharing manum definitely a lot to consider for sureI know you've got limited timeum I've got one more question for yousothat's all dependent on the amount ofpeople that agree to those qualitiesright or the it's it's a network effectessentially yeahum so can it be banned what if they turnthe power off what are your thoughts onI guess those two questionsyeah just speak to the properties ofmoney firstumthe properties that I'm trying tohighlight there this is what people haveselected forin good money historically I feel veryconfident about that but what you'resaying is and you're right demand issubjective right I can't say objectivelyhumans will always choose these thingsfor moneyumbut what I can say and this is umsomewhat more axiomatic I guess peopledon't like to be stolen from rightthat's pretty fair to say I think maybenot Universal maybe there's a fewexceptions whatever but in generalpeople don't like to be stolen fromif you're savingif you're holding Savings in a currencythat someone else can print and debasethen you're being stolen from that'srightif you're holding Savings in an assetthat people cannot arbitrarily print ordebaseyou're saving in something that cannotbe used to steal from you as much that'swhy gold was a better long-term storevalue than dollars that's why Bitcoin isbetter than gold soone of the ways I view this is It's notas more inflation taxation regulation ispressed upon peoplein pursuit of their own individualeconomic livelihoods are forced toevaluate other optionsyeah andthe most resistant option right the mostthe the lowestthe form of money with the lowestcounterparty risk as we describedearlier the counterparty risk which youcould Define counterparty risk as like aviolation of contractand in that way you could think ofBitcoin as like an inviolable contractit's like you're holding this fixedamount of money in the way that no onecan steal no one can flee no one canviolate so in a world wheregovernment overreach is increasing rightmore wealth redistribution more theftmore confiscation more taxationpeople are kind of likethrough osmotic pressure almost and thepursuit of their own Survival andself-interest pushedinto a more Untouchable asset let's saya lessable asset yeahmore inflation resistant assetsand at the very end of thatthat particular spectrum is Bitcoin soit's like the ultimate Safe Haven assetin a world plagued by wealthredistribution schemesnow what happens if they turn out thepower and can they ban itI'll start with Banning itumI would Point people here actually to anepisode I did with Preston pishand his investors podcast BTC 001 I gointo depth on that but there was abitcoin's just information first of allso to ban Bitcoin in the United Statesat least you'd have to overturn theFirst Amendmentthere is some case precedence for thisum the feds try to classifypretty good privacy software which ispgp softwarethey tried to classify it as Munitions Ithink this is back in the 90s so thatyou could not export pgp softwareoutside of the USand that entire casetook a turn against the feds whensomeone printed out pgp on paper andsaid look here it is this is pgpsoftware it's information on paperobviously protected under the FirstAmendment how can you classify this asmunitionsand so since then we have had the caseprecedent that open source software isprotected under the first amendment inthe United Stateseven if that was overturned and you tryto ban it you get into some really weirdthings when you make language illegalagain it's like what I can't wear at-shirt with a certain words I can't saycertain words colors can be illegal likeit math can be illegal like it doesn'tmake any sense you get into La La Landreally quicknow the power going offis interesting becausethis does highlight a vulnerability tothe extent thatyour energy that you are dependent on acentralized power gridthat is the extent to which you can beshot out of the Bitcoin mining Networkbut to try the the only way to stopBitcoin through this attack Vector wouldbe turning offthe power worldwide foreveryou'd have to stop the production ofelectricityor though that would that would benecessary to stop it that's and that'sveryfar-fetched as far as I can tell I meanif we did have some type ofcataclysm that caused that we'd probablyhave bigger things to worry aboutum yeah like we couldn't do this podcastanymore obviously that's right that'srightso uhand if anything these type and these aregood questions that come up a lot but inpursuing the answers to them you end upin these really Fantasticalfar-flung like low probabilitysituations where you're likewell the world like really needs toimplode to a point to where we're goingback to the Stone Age for Bitcoin to notwork so yeah if that eventuality is notpart of your model thenBitcoin will continue to exist and ifBitcoin continues to exist and humanscontinue to print money the Bitcoincontinues to out compete all inferiorforms of money yeahand people in pursuit of their ownlivelihood choose the best moneyavailable to them and so far as I cantell Bitcoin is the best moneywe will ever have available to usI completely agree with you man thoselast two questions were sent in thanksthanks for answering thatI think your message is an incrediblyimportant oneum just thank you so much for for yourknowledge and for how much you'veinvested in Sharing knowledge in this inthis Arena particularly thank you somuch for your timeum anything you'd like to leave ouraudience with in terms of we'd like toguide themforeignI really appreciate you guys having meand I'm I'm glad you're talking abouttruth that is avery poorly understood topic these daysso um it's good to help people equipthemselves with the right tools to toinvestigate truth andI guess the last thing I would say isjust I think the most importantpromise of Bitcoin we didn't get intothis but umCentral Banking is used to fund GlobalWarfareand so to the extent that we candevitalize the central bank that we canmove our wealth into an alternativesystemis the same degree to which we canreduce the probability of World War Oneand World War II happening again Fiatcurrencies were indispensable to thescale scope and severity you know ofthose conflicts in the 20th centuryand at Rock Bottom I think Bitcoin isthis peaceful humanitarian Mission thisethical alternative tothe monopolization counterfeiting ofcurrency so if you want to vote againstthe possibility of World War III thenconsider studying and perhaps saving inBitcoinawesome guys thanks so much forlisteningum we'll see you next time take care[Music]",
