We've reached the point of our late stage fiat system where the decision to increase the amount of debt our government is allowed to accrue has to be made quite frequently. There are months spent posturing and bickering from both sides of the aisle as the limit is approached. One side desperately pleas for the limit to be raised immediately to quell market fears and ensure that the government can operate while the other LARPs about holding a hard line on the debt in an attempt to cater to their base before inevitably folding and allowing the limit to be raised again. Giving the world a break from the temporary bickering until the next showdown happens a couple of years down the line.This doom loop of kicking the can down the road is an extremely dangerous game that we play. For every time the can gets kicked further down the road in the form of a higher debt limit, the less serious the limit is taken. It exists as a form of forced temperance to make sure the federal government is being responsible with the finances of the country. The normalization of the raising of the debt limit renders the attempted temperance null and, therefore, allows the government to be as irresponsible and reckless with the nation's finances as they would like to be. Fueling wars, spending on entitlement programs, subsidizing soy slop and unreliable energy infrastructure, and a slew of other wasteful endeavors are simply thrown in the grocery cart. And when all is said and done the people who are footing the bill are our children who are forced to deal with ever higher tax rates and price inflation from money printing that will inevitably come in an attempt to service the debt that has been racked up. We don't even really have to wait for our children to suffer these consequences. We are already suffering them today due to the inability of those who came before us and those who are in control today to face the problem head on. I don't know about you, but as a father with two young children I don't feel comfortable at all allowing this cycle to continue. I know how hard it is for many people who are struggling to get by today because of the irresponsible management of the federal government and monetary system throughout our lifetime. I can't imagine how hard it is going to be for future generations if we keep barrelling down this path.We need to take the words above from Thomas Paine seriously if we are to consider ourselves loving parents who believe it is our job to make the world a better place for our children. It's not fun to go through times of turbulence and uncertainty, but it is far worse to damn our children and grandchildren to a worse fate by standing by and doing nothing. It would be a great shame if we proved to be so cowardly that we put our heads in the sand and say \"let them figure it out\".It is time for our generation to come to grips with reality. Our government has grown too large, too reckless, and wholly unable to deal with the reality that we're not going to be able to honor the debt that it has amassed. Social security is a Ponzi. Medicare and Medicaid are Ponzis. We spend way too much on war. We throw money at uneconomical pipe dreams like a national grid system operated by wind and solar energy. The Fed has lost control of the wheel. We live in a time where the law isn't honored, it is routinely ridiculed by those in power who operate on a different plane than the rest of us. And yet... we take it all. We let them piss in our faces while telling us it's raining.For the sake of our children and those who come after them it's time to bring on the trouble in our day. It's time to take the fight to those looking to anchor our children to a life of debt slavery. This is why we bitcoin. But at the end of the day, bitcoin isn't enough. The people driving the bus into a dystopian future need to be incessantly mocked and made to feel like the parasites they are. People need to stand up and say, \"Rip the bandaid off. Default. I do not expect to receive the benefits I'm paying into and I don't care about it because continuing down this path will only lead to greater pain for my children. Let the shit hit the fan. I'll help you load the slingshots.\"Sure, there will be some chaotic times and a lot of angry people, but the longer the inevitable is delayed, the worse the reaction is going to be. Let's ensure that our children and their children can have peace. Final thought...Shoutout to my wife who is the most incredible mother to our two beautiful sons.
