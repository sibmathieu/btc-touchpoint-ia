the once bittenbitcoin podcastand all-round excellent bitcoiner whosebeen churning out great quality bitcoincontentregularly and joining us here on theseminar alwaysumyou you've definitely heard him ifyou've listened here beforedaniel also wrote a book called chooselife and in it he describes hisadventures of uh quitting the rat raceand uhfocusing on homeschooling his kids andtraveling the worldand uh livinga free life with which uh i thinkbitcoin has uh arguably helped him quitea bitso daniel has for a long timebeen uh giving me a lot of prohomeschooling propaganda and it issomething that i am uh generally uhfavorable to myselfuh so i thought we'd have an extensivediscussion here on the topic ofhomeschoolingand um we're gonna have follow this upwith the next discussion in a couple ofdayson fiat education and the problems offiat education so daniel thank you forjoining usthanks for inviting me on safe reallyglad to be here i'm i'm hoping thatpropaganda hashelped in some wayit has it has so umi mean it's definitely inching me closerand closer towards the choice ofhomeschoolingso could you uh i guess make the overallcase for whyyou think somebody should considerhomeschooling their kidsyou know schools are out therewe get professionals to doeverything for us professionals buildour computers they make our furniturethey build our housesand you can't expect to be able to begood at everything so why notletspecialization do its job with childrenvery good question umthe the the overriding kind of uh pointthati think people should really understandis that they have a choicemost people don't even realize that inthe first place they just thinkschool is the be-all and the end-all andthis is the only thing that they haveavailable to them which just isn't thecase it hasn't been the case for formany decades and it certainly isn't thecase now with the rise of the internetand information technology uh onlineschooling and what elsethere are so many different ways thatyou can look and think abouteducating your children that you wouldactually becrazy to not consider themyeah i think it uh definitely makessense and i think umthe uhthe possibilities that are available fora parent today compared to what theywere just 20 or 30 years ago is uhis very different in factparticularly over the last two years andas it seems now you know this permanentnew world in which we livein which kids going to school is goingto bea luxury of a few weeksevery year while they spend the rest ofthe yearglued into zoomis making it look you know no matterwhere you are in the world it's lookingincreasinglyuh well not know there are a few placesthat are holdouts for freedom floridaand texasum belarus a few other places around theworldbut generally most people are prettymuch stuck with uhhomeschoolinguh one way or the other you know even ifyou don't want to homeschool you aregoing to be homeschooling you're goingto have toset them up with a zoom office andhave themjoin their teachers and their classmatesat the specified timesand follow up with all of the worksoit's almost becoming inevitable thatyou're having to use that and then ofcourse when you think about justthe amazing possibilities of what is outthereit kind of makes sense but then againisn't it better for a person to just goand do their job rather thantry and learn how to do the job of anelementary school teacher i mean thesepeople specialize in doing this year inyear out 20 years 30 years they've gotthe experience they've handled kids theyknow their problems they know what theyneedand you know you're good at other thingsyou've done other things in your lifeand you're better off going and mininguh bitcoin by doing another job and thenpaying professionals for the handling ofyour kidsyeah absolutely mate and um to to uhlike you know dwell on the point thatyou were making there about uhthe the schooling from home which hasbeen going on ever since uh covet hituh that is very different um to tohomeschooling what homeschooling is is acompletely different mindsetuh around the education of the kid it'salmosthomeschooling probably shouldn't even bethe word because it's not school at homea lot of people there are so manydifferent terms for it mate that uh it'sbecome a little bit of a kind of a nichewithin a nicheuh some people like to say that they'reunschoolers other people like to saythat they're you know they're followinga self-directed education kind of pathwhich is probably what we're doingin fact because we use uh galileo i knowa lot of people have listened to theshow and heard me talk about that andthey've heard lauren on the showand she talks about it and she sometimeshas to run off and sign into a differentclubssotraditional homeschoolingthat people have in their mindsisschool at home and that is what peoplehave been exposed to since we werelocked down due to coronaand it's hell and it doesn't workbecauseyou are nottrained and you don't have the time todo all of that and you don't have the umthe will to follow like the umthe fear uh education curriculum becauseyou soon find out yourself god damn thisis boring is all helland you just know that you're spinningyour wills and you knowbut in fact the first thing that happensuh when you do this and my wife and i wemade this first mistake when we firststarted to travel in 2014the first thing we didwascreate a timetablefor our home schoolingand it would be like 9 a.m we'll get upand we'll do some uh some reading andwriting and 10 a.m we'll have a breakand at 10 30 a.m we'll do some some kindof math andabsolute disasterbut every homeschooling parent goesthrough the same kind of learning curvebecause you realizethat youthat is only ever going to workin a schooling system where it iscompulsory that that compulsion is thereand that set timetable is there and youhave the um the system set in place andthe teachers are gonna have you sat downand opening the books and the bell isgonna have you moving when it's whenyou're supposed to and then um you knowcome the end of the day eight hoursdisappears and you can leave again andthen go homefirst thing you do when you get home iswhat sit at a kitchen table eat somekind of unhealthy snackopen your homework books and spend thenext three or four hours doing morehomeworkthat systemitself is a disaster when you bring thathomeand you try and replicate that system athomethere's no way in the world that's evergoing to work there is an immediatebreakdown between parent and childbecause you're trying to force a systemthat is completelyuh alien to the um to the home and it'sjusta complete messbuteveryone when they first start they willdo thisyou can't stop yourself because we areso programmed it's sopsychologically drummed into us we'veall been systemizedpossibly since the age of five dependingwhich country you came from maybe evenearlier we've all been through it andwe're all carrying these um traumatraumas uh throughout our schoolingcareer that um we'vebeen exposed to and have to carry thatbaggage into our adult lifeand that's another real big problem whenyou sit downand you start trying to help the kidswith certain problemsand that problem is out of your scope ofintellectyou shut downand you start getting angry and youstart getting anxiousand this is a big problem that we seewith homework when kids come home andthey need homework help from uh fromtheir parents but their parents suddenlyrealizethis is likeno way i was ever taught how to do thismy 20 years ago so they've changed theway that they're teaching kidsthere's no way i can get to the answerthat they want you to get to using themethod that they are usingand then you have this horriblebreakdown again within the familyuh i've rambled there i can't rememberyour exact question in the beginning buti think that's a very great answer of uhyou know why not just hand it over to uhprofessionals well umwell actually no this isn't much of ananswer this is this is an argument forhanding them over to professionals iguess but you you made a good pointabout uhwhy this kind of uh environment is isnot goodand i think yeah i think i agree i thinkum one common objection you hear tohomeschooling is people will say wellthis is terrible preparation for livingin societyyou've got to go to school and you'vegot to be socialized but in realitysociety is not like that society is notyou and 30 people in one roomand doing what other people have decidedfor you to do and you just need to keepfollowing instructions and you'rerewarded for how well you followinstructionsthis isnot lifegenerallythis is life for students at school andit's if it's useful preparation for alife it's useful preparation forthe life of the militaryor for the life of a slave or for thelife of somebody who's essentiallyemployedwith no regard to their will it's it'sit's about what others want you to doand it's umto an extent it is reflective of theoffice environment and i thinkthis isn't this isn't goodsocialization i think the people who saythisumbetray a very warped view of whatsociety is like if you think school isgood preparation for societyi thinkyou misunderstoodyou're using your society wrong i thinkyou need to go back to theshop and ask them how to dealyou know how to actually use societyproperly because it's not similar toschool society is not meant to be aplace where you're constantly beinggiven orders andtreated with no regard to what you wantthis is i think the key thing about theschool systemsocialization fudd is the number onethat's that that's that's the boilingthe oceans of of uh homeschooling andit's so tiring and you've just nailed itand theo's just said in the chat anyonethinking that homeschooling doesn'tprepare for life in society never met ahomeschooled child that is so true and icannot like emphasize that pointhard enough every homeschooled kid i'vemet or world-schooled kid or unschooledor self-directed whatever you want tocall it has blown me awayand it was the early ones that we met inour travels that really started uhshaping my thinkingthat about you know having made theright decision becausewe were constantly questioning ourdecision like what the hell are weactually doing i've just quit my jobwhich you know was a good fiat miningjob we've just left a country we'd livedin for 15 years we've got four kids agedunder eightand we're just bouncing around the worldwith them like doing whatever the hellwe like and just enjoying freedombut at the same time using theseexperiences to uh layer on learningopportunities and education just in anexperiential way rather than thecompulsory wayand meeting meeting the um the othertravelers because you you find yourtribewhatever you're doing you find themonline twitter facebook wherever and youyou do a beach meetup or a city meet-uppark meet-up wherever you are andmeeting these other families kids i waslike ohman we're doing the right thinglook at these kidsthey're you know that they would come upto us they would shake me by the handlook me in the eye even if there wassevenand like introduce themselves and then iwould sit down and have a conversationwith themthey were just so adept totalking to anybody of any age of anyculture of any race of any colorof any sexi couldn't believe it whereas if youmeeta typical 13 to 15 year old completelycompulsory schooled umteenageryou getglam they won't even look at youmost of the timethey might just say hello and then kindof look to the floor or i mean you knowsoak off into the corner and go on totheir device or something they don'twant to be part of you becauseto themthe adult in the room is the authoritythe adult in the room is not to beconversed withthe adult in the room is not to beplayed withthe adult in the room is just there tobe the authority to tell them what to doif they decide to that they need them todo somethingandthat is not social now in my book um idid uh i did try and bust the myth ofsocializationand um there if you look in thedictionary there's twouh definitions of the word uh socializenumber one is mixed socially with otherswhich is what people think is happeningat schoolthey honestly think that by sending yourkidinto schoolto be aroundkidsgenerally the exact same age as themfrom the exact same town as themmore often than not the same race asthemthatthey are going to find friends andsocialize no problemnow we all know that that hardly everhappenswe all know that you get crammed intorandomly crammed into uh groups of 25 30people whether or not you have anythingin commonlike uh with these guys or girls at alland you're forced to sit with themin silence for the next five to sevenyears whatever it isand you're not allowed to converseand i guessso i tell people all the time it's likewhen theythey complain oh my god my my son or mydaughter they get home from school thefirst the first thing they dois get on the phone to their friends andthen they're just on the phone to theirfriends for like four or five hours yeahblah blah blah blah blah i'm like wellwhy do you think that is well i've beenwith them all day so i mean why did ihave to keep on yeah they've been withthem all day but they've not been ableto speak to them not oncemaybe 15 20 minutes at recreation butotherwise they're sat next to each othersure but they're not talking to eachother they're not sharing ideas they'renot thinking big picture thinkingthey're sat down they're quiet andthey're listening to the flapping headat the front of the roomuh the otherum the other definitionuh is um for socialization is makesomeone behave in a way that isacceptable to their societyyeah which is exactly what you justhighlightedum and that's what's going onthey are just literally teaching kidsto be subservientto not question authorityand to beone of the massesand this is the problem that we arefacing in society todaypeople think entrepreneurs are theselike amazing you know megaminds uh youknowtake big risks and on whatever else andgo and build huge amazingbusinesses i would argue that's actuallythe default mindset of any human beingand as sir ken robinson quotesuh he believes strongly that umwe get educated out of creativityyeah it's just not allowedyou know that the teacherhasto indoctrinate that set of kidsto the answerthat the curriculum calls forso that is indoctrination to the answerandwe peel that onion back a little furtherwho creates the curriculum and who'slooking for the answers we all know thatit's a top-down structure it's made byeducation ministers unelected educationministers bureaucratsthey create the education they createthe um curriculumthat gets pushed down onto the governingbodies that gets pushed down onto theschools that gets pushed down onto theheadmaster or mistress that gets pusheddown onto the teacher and that getspushed down onto the kids i meanrolls downhill like there's never abetter analogy than that so the teachersare just as stuck in the systemas the kids they do not have controlover the classroom they can't teach tothe schedule that they want to teachthey have to teach the exact schedulethat curriculum calls forthey can't be creative in any waybecause they have to indoctrinate thekids to the answer that the curriculumcalls forthey've lost control and they are justas beaten up by the system as the kidsare they've just pretty much becomeuh heavily umadministrated or administrative um headsat the front of the class that are justbasicallygrinding out 30-year career so they canget to the end of it walk away and havetheir pensionand that's a disaster in itself becauseteachers and mentors they need spacethey need creativity they want toconnect with kids that's why they gointo teachingto have that ability taken away from youis a real travestyyeahit's uhit's uh i've noticed this uh i thinkeducation all around the world hasgenerally become a lot more formulaicand centralizedand standardized over the past few yearsand i hear stories about it just uh youknow it's it's about getting the rightanswer using the right way that theywantand the right answer is how they thinkof it it's not about it being uh makingsense it's not about being correctum in any practical sense and i think uhyou know one thing you alluded to is thefact that they get back home and theywant to talk to their friends anotherthing that they do when they get backhome is they want to do homework which ifoundabsolutely uhinsanereally i mean youyou you wake them up early in themorning you drag them out of bed you getthem dressed and you send them off to aplace where they would learn and theycome back and they still need to do morelearning it seems to me it doesn't justseem to me i've gone through this uhhellscape for 12 years i know what i'mtalking about i i remember you know youcan imagine how insufferable i must havebeen as a 14 year old having to gothrough school and you know my parentsand my teachers suffered a lotwith me explaining to them you know whythis is just so stupidand i was there i used to remember justhow much of the day what would go towardlearning new things i rememberi it was around 9th or 10th grade wherei would keep trackby the minute of how many minutes wespent learning new useful informationduring that dayand it wasalmost always i'm not almost always itwas always under an hour of new stuffbecausethat that's the only kind of real newlearning that you do because the rest ofthe day you're going over old stuffor you'repreparing for an exam or you'rejust engaged in all kinds ofrepetitive exercises repeatingthe same kind of thingbut you've gonethrough the enormous hassle ofgetting all these kids shipped off toone location which is always alogistical nightmare you knowgetting them all in safely into the sameplace on buses or carsall of them to come in together andall that they do is learn a very fewthingsand then they go home and they need togo home and they need to study on theirown because they have to learn on theirown they have to spend their time doingtheir homeworkand it's uh it's it's an enormous wasteand if you think about itwhat kids do in the summeruh when they're free from school ends upbeing the most memorable and mostmosteven educational things that they dobecause in the summer they could takecare advantage of this and actually goout and explorenature explore life get a summer jobyou know live like members of societyrather than uh membersof uha weird cultum they can actually go out there youknow and help somebody in their shop anduh make a little bit of money and thenbuy something with it it's it's it'sit's very educational so life itself isum it has a lot to offer for everyoneand definitely has a lot to offer forchildren who have seen so little of lifeso just getting them out there toexperience life for me isisis extremely valuable and schoolprevents that from happeningand it doesn'tdo it it doesn't take up a lot of timebecause it's worth it it takes up a lotof time because it's inefficient i usedto thinkum if i was uhdoing theif i was doing the curriculum on myspeedit would take a lot less time and ithink it's true for most kidsgenerally becauseclasses generally have to go at thespeed of theslowest kidsandon the one hand you have that but theneven perhaps more important than thatit's justthe inefficiencies of having to geteverybody on the same pageand then switching them up you knowwhere you have to go from chemistry tomathematics toall these different subjects in 50minute intervals and get the kids tosnap out of this topic and get into thattopic and move the kids around or movethe teachers around it's just umthere's a lot of inefficiency involvedin it as opposed to just letting thekids figure out what they want andsupervising the learning i can see i candefinitely see the benefits of havingprofessional teachersbut i don't see the benefits of thisindustrial scale modeli can see i think it'sit's doneprimarily to the benefit of[Music]government and organizations that wantto have peopleturn intouseful docileorder takersin the second degree it is beneficialfor children for parents becausethey get a lot of free time withouthaving to deal with their childrenand it'srelatively cheapalthoughi mean public schooling is cheap butprivate schooling is expensive butit's definitely not in the interest ofthe student i think if theif the student had the meansof an adult who would be willing to givethem some time and attention they coulddo a lotwith their timethey could learn much more efficientlywhat do you think of that in terms ofjust the efficiency of learning the uheducational material whatever it isfirst of all it shocks me to learn thatyou were questioning authority at theage of 14 soand uh sort through the inefficienciesof the industrial beast that it is butyou know you're so right it's daycarelike let's call it what it is straightup it's daycare and that's going totrigger a few people oh no it's not youknow you knowman like that the best meme they evercame up with was free education is ahuman rightthat is a meme it's a tagline and it'svery very powerful and people repeat itand they repeat it and they repeat itand then as soon as they um they feellike well free education is a humanright then bam i've got to put my kidsinto school i've got to put my kids intothat education systembut well they didn't what they didn'ttell you like the small print of thatmeme was as long as we have the abilityto teach them whatever we want wheneverwe want and this is where we have likethe nationalistic curriculums indifferent countries around the worldand again people are going to be likewhat's he talking about there's no wayit's nationalistic well you know check ahistory curriculum in any differentcountry you'll find a very nationalisticbias towards that country uh in americai believe they still um stand up eachmorning and pledge allegiance to theflag i mean if that's not nationalistici don't know what else is in singaporeour kidswe schooled them across differentschools when they went to state schoolthey played the national anthem everymorning at 7 30 a.m when you're expectedto be at the school gates if you werewalking across the playgroundwith your child take them into the classand the first bar of the national anthemstarted yet stand still man[Music]rain or shineno walking whilst the national anthemplayed it's mental when you think aboutit and it is just daycare you're soright it's because it frees up and weall know whythere was a huge push back in um wellafter the50s and 60s a huge push to push womeninto the workplaceand againtotally agree with you know ladies youwant to go on work absolutely 100 butthat was infiltrated andfor a very good reasonpeople werewomen were aggressively pushed into theworkplacebecauseyou suddenly become a taxpayer your taxbase goes upby a lot if you've now got women in theworkplace so what do you do you lay ondaycare daycare is state educationunder the guise ofeducationis uh free education as a human rightso you have these inefficiencies in thesystem that you're talking about thesekids like you're sayingmaybe you're 12 maybe you're in a mathclass and it's just clicking what you'retalking about that day you're justgetting itthen the bell goes and you're afterhistoryyou can never get in a flow stateeverit's it's crazyit's just not the way we learn as humanbeings we just do not learn that way welearn when we're involved in somethingeverybody listening to thiswill attest to the fact they've listenedto thousands of hours of bitcoinpodcasts they've read all the booksthey've read all the articles they'vewatched all the youtube videostheir own timeand i have no idea how many hoursthey've done doing it because they'vebeen so involved in it they're in thatflow state they're interested in the uhthe materialand they're going to learn they're justgoing to naturally learn that's howhuman beings learnnot in short sharp bursts of 45 minutesor an hour and a half if it's a doubleperiodlistening to the flapping headwho's disinterested just as much as thekids because they're thinking about thenext period and maybe they've got the 15year olds coming in next and they've gotpreparing mentally in their mind what'sthe next part of the curriculum for themit's it's such a broken systembut very few peopleever want to challenge it the systemnever gets challengedeverwhat happens instead is really insidiousit's the kid's faultthere's something wrong with the kidand if there's something wrong with akid that blame gets pushed onto theparents it's the parent's faultso the parents get pushed uh pulled intoschoolyour son can't sit stillhe's he's eightwell there's something wrong with himand we can't have him disrupting therest of the classso now it's the parent's fault and naomifisher talks about this in her bookchanging our minds it's a brilliant bookand she talks about umthe blame or brainum phenomena that phenomenon thathappens when you're faced with this as aparent it's like well i'm gonna blamemyselfwhich is very very difficult to do as aparent because you know you've doneeverything you can for your childit's just naturalor there's something wrong with thebrainand so then what happens oh there'ssomething wrong with our kid then youget pushed into this corner ofbegging for a diagnosis of somethingjust give me a diagnosis so that we knowwhat's wrong with our childwhen there's nothing wrong withthe kid at all it's the systemwe have got thisdespicable problemwhere adhd or is called something else ithink in the inner statesadhd or add i i don't know um thatthere's yeahwe're pumping kids full of ritalinbecause they can't sit still in aclassroom they're bored out of theirheads withit'smay i i cannotstate how angry that makes meyeah it's insane i think there's anenormous amount of money that is beingmade from um medicating normal humanreactions toall kinds of things it'sit'sinstead of thinking about what is is inthe environment that is driving peopleto do these uh dysfunctional behaviorsuh the idea is nope it's got to besomething chemical and so let's justgive them some drugs and that'll fix itand of courseeducation isis contributing to that uh particularsales funnel quite prolifically it's andit's astonishing the number of peoplethat um have their lives uhtaken over almost by a dependency on adrug from a very young ageand it's uh pretty difficult to beat itbut i mean some people do beat it butit's not easy to get over thisthat it'sit's absolutely insane because when youthink about it yeahthe the kids don't want to sit still inclass because they want to do otherthings you know they do have other ideasof what they'd like to do and all theseother things that they interest themthey could develop intolearning opportunities or they coulddevelop into careers or they coulddevelop into lifelong passions soletting the child have the freedom toexplore and learn what they want willeventually drive them in the directionof wanting to learn you know whatever itis that the child is interested in solet's say they like uh sports carsso then they get into sports cars theyspend their time pursuing their interestin it and then they realize well if youwant to work in sports carsyou need to learnmath and you need to understandengineering andthat means there are certain things youneed to learn here are some booksread this book and you'll be able tomaybe one day get a job making thesecars or designing them and that's that'sgoing to get the passion of the child tostart spending an enormous amount oftime on this and if you look at peoplethatexcel in many fields you find that theyhad that freedom growing up wheretheir school was almost turned into asecondaryconcernbecause they were spending their timethe majority of their timegoing after this one passion of theirsand it could be becoming an athlete itcould be studying a topicit could be performingmusic orall kinds of thingsor it could be just a highly umspecialized skilled job which they growinto say like a graphic designer or aprogrammer or umall these things you know people end uppursuing themwith passion outside of school hoursbecause they'd love them they enjoy themthey want to learn they want to getbetter at them and you see it and yousee people doing this all through theirlife andumfor childrenit'sit's just a very big waste of time toengage in this in my opinion in thisformulaicsystem ofperforming rituals in order to get toeducationwhenyou could be umdirecting yourself towards the thingsthat you want and i still think you knowyou need adult supervision but i don'tthink you need adult supervision in theform of being shuffled into one buildingwith hundreds of peopleandsubject tostandardized testing and having yourschedule hijacked for an entire day foressentially ninemonths of the yeari don't think that's the guidance theyneed i think kids could use a lotmore individualist guidance and i seei see perhaps the value in havingclasses but i don't thinkit makes you know i can see how uh itwould make sense to hire somebodyto um you know hire a bunch of kidsfor a bunch of kids parents to gettogether and hire somebody who's good atchemistry to give them good chemistryclassesbutyou know having it as part of an entirecurriculum along with other topicsisjust asking for troubleif you start systematizing it and if youstartforcing all thesescheduledevelopmentaround the topicit turns it intoit turns it into a shore basically andthen it knocks out the curiosityyeah 100 it's funny you you mention asports car driver for examplefangio the best sports car driver of alltimebecame the best he attributes the factthat he became the best sports cardriver of all time becausewhen he was a teenager i think hisfather wanted him tobe a doctor or something or you know theclassic doctor lawyer or financewhatever he just wanted to work withcars and he would go and work in thelocal garages for free evenand he got a very very intimateunderstanding of the mechanics of a carto the point where he was driving uh informula one he could still strip andrebuild that enginenow there's a reason he became thenumber one driver in the world of alltimebecause of when he was a kid he got lostin that learning and he became part ofthat whole experience with his hands hewas learning from his mistakesyou know that's not something you canlearn in a classroomlike if you'd have taken mechanical likeuh sports car racing mechanical lessonsfor 45 minutes once a weekit would not have had the same resultsuh it's um yeah and even if he studiedmechanical engineering at universitylevel which i didumto be perfectly honest i mean it's uha lot of it is just a bunch of equationsthat they tack onumlater butif iwanted to go out there and get a sportscar to actually workpretty muchmost or 90 of what i'd need to know tomake the sports carworki wouldn't have learned in mechanicalengineering and 90 of what i learned inmechanical engineering is not going tobe relevant to making that sports carworkit's relevantand useful formaking exams and forhaving a curriculum andyou knowto give credit i think it's useful in uhfiltering peoplein terms of conscientiousness and workethicin thatyou can't get an engineering degreeunless you have the ability to sit downand spend several hourstackling a problemum and thinking about it andthinking really hard about how to solveitso you seethere is some value perhaps in that inin screening for employees but it's anenormously inefficient wayof screening you know you you you couldget a much bettermore efficient way of screeninguh for these things without having to gothrough all these very elaborate ritualsbut yeah i think um it's it's verydifferent in that sense so so tell usthenhow do you go about it so you don't dothe curriculum you don't have math anduhyou don't have a set hour for math sothen what do you do they just party allday yeah exactly[Laughter]well we've got four kids and this isanother thing you got to remember likeeach kid is completely different we havetwins made completely different like uhtotally different work ethic totallydifferent interests totally differentlearning style completely different soif they're in the same classroomtogether which we've experienced they'vebeen in the same classroom togetherwe'll get good reports for one and mereports for the otherthat's not like it drives me crazybecause you knownow all of a sudden that theirpersonalities are being judgedrather than their um their abilities andtheir abilitiesuh as we knowas their parentsjust found in different areas and if oneof those um abilities isn't beingaddressed in a classroom then um thenthey're gonnaperform badly in the eyes of the of theteacherum soright now uh our 16 year old uh shechooses to go to schoolshe uses the education systemwe are in france and when we when wetraveled we traveled for two and a halfyears doing the world schoolinguh we took a break we tookum a long-term rental in franceand we wanted the kids to learn anotherlanguage and we knew the only way thatwe could do that was to immerse them soagain it comes back to the originalpointchoiceyou have a choice you can dowhat you want and what you need to dowhen you see the opportunity arise sothere was a montessori french school anda little hamlet we put the threeyoungest ones in therelet's try this out for a weekthey were the school were really happyto bring them onand the kids really enjoyed ituh my oldest one went to uh theuh the older school uh the umit's called elysee here uh collegeexcuse menowthe the younger three they're all backout and they are using uh what'swe call a self-directed educationplatform that's galileogalileo.galileoxp.com and the way thatworks is because it's self-directededucationkids are in charge of making thedecisions of what clubs they want tojoinso they take a look at the clubs eachmonth the clubs get mixed up there aresome that just runall year round like the math class runsall year round science classesuh english writing classes run all yearround which they do and which they enjoydoingthefun there's a coding coding class thatruns all year round as wellso you decide um and then they havethese monthly clubs that they just popup it'll beuh there might be a club on um trying tothink of the most recent onesuhanthropology or archaeology or uh youknow just studying amphibians forwhatever reason uh and somebody willcome on and run that club for the kidsto join if they're so interested so whatyou get is a teacheron a zoom call with 10 to 15 kids thathave chosen to be there they're therefor a reason the teacher's there for areason and so you have a much betterlearning environment straight awayuh somy kids daysthey uh they start around nine to ninethirtythey log on to their zoom coursethey do their their morning meetingcheck in with the usual bunch of guysfor 30 minutesthen they'll go and make themselves somebreakfast generally egg and bacon my sonloves a breakfast burrito can't stop himeating themand then they have the rest of the daythey might have a couple of hours wherenothing's going onuh so they might um hang out with methey might be doing something with mumbut then like 11 o'clock they'll have abook nook uh meeting where that'senglish literature for example they'llbeplaying games learning about englishlearning about grammarwith the the english teacheruh maybe this afternoon i think theyhave a debate club which is hosted by anadultand he will pick a topic each weekand split the guys into twoand debate a subject whether it's acurrent event or an existing event orjust a made-up hypothetical eventand uhthat's been a really good experienceactually the kids all love that onethey've now started a few languageclassesumand the the cool thing is they they pluginto all of these different tools thatare already available orum starting to launch on the internetso if there are so many differentplatforms starting nowlikewe talk in the uh the bitcoin spaceabout how corona has sped up the worldby about 10 years right did the shiftthe move to online or alternativeeducation what did you want to call itis happening so damn quickly and i knowyou're involved with sailor.org sothat'sa perfect example of what how that isgoing to make university almostseem obsoleteor seem at least at least give youat least give you an option do i want tospend 200 grand or do i want to go andlearn what i want at my own paceon this on this platform over hereso we we've we've captured it all nowfrom from 8 to 18 you have platformslike galileo where you can learnwhatever you want self-directed findwhat you're interested in and thenyou'll have something like sailor.orgwhere you can really start knucklingdownand even i think michael sailor saidthey're hoping in the next couple ofyears to even become fully accredited soyou'll be able to graduate you knowquotes from that online university withthe accreditation that you need to goout into the marketplace and startlooking for workthis this is hugethis is massiveyeah it's insane i think the uh you knowwe i was just discussingsailor.org with michael saylor a coupleof days ago on twitter spaces and i'mgoing to be releasing this as a podcastin fact it's probably going to be out bythe time this one's outand it's it's amazing they're closing inon a million students they're going tohave their millionth student comingjoining them in the next month or soandwhen you think about it you know thecost of getting an education for astudent there think about all of themoney that they've spent on sailor.orgsince conception until todayfor a million students you know it'sgoing to be i would imagine probably atmost 20 bucks a student if 20 million isthe total amount of spending maybesowhatever it is it's not going to be morethan a hundred so it's it's a hundreddollars maybe it could be as little as adollar i don't exactly know how they runit on the back end and how much has costbut it's a million students forcewhat is definitely less than 100 dollarsper studentum and then you think about universitiesyou know traditional universities whoare always looking for donations thinkabout how much your money can go thereso you could donate to one of theseuniversities two hundred thousanddollars and you would give one studentan education whereas if you donate maybea hundred dollars to sailor.org or fiftydollars or ten dollarsyou'd give a student um an education andi thinkuh you know it might be much less thanthat um in inin all likelihoodso the efficiencies involved areenormous and it's umlikei think there are definitely advantagesto the personal uh experience ofeducation where you go to a classroomand interact with others sure it'sdefinitely nicer thansitting in front of a screenbutit'syou knowyou have to think about you have toweigh all of thecosts and benefits of both decisions inorder to come out all with an answerof which is better because you'll getthe vast majority of the benefits of thelecture whether you're watching it on uhonline or if you're watching it inpersonand then with the money that you saveyou know if you go to sailor.org and thewhole thing costs younothing basically just the internetconnection and electricitywell if you want to get the certificateyou need to pass the courses there's anactual exam that you have to pay forthere's a hundred dollar fee orsomething because you're going to payfor somebody to proctor you while youtake the exam so it'll cost yousomething but practically it rounds downto zero it's it's a rounding error nextto the cost of going to a regularuniversity so now think about theopportunity cost of the going to theuniversity is it really worththat extraumpersonal interaction you get fromsitting in the classroomis it really worth having all that moneyavailable for you to invest inumsomething that you enjoy umworking on after you graduate i thinkthis is really the key thing i used tosay this to my students when i was auniversity professor and it wouldseriously make them questionstaying in university which is you knowlike umwhatever it is that you want to dowhatever job you want to get you knowthink about all the money that you'reputting at universityand spend the next spend the years ofuniversity learning on your own onlineand learning on the job in whatever jobyou want to do so let's say you want togo intoa graphic design you know go and get ajob in graphic design and learn onlineor if you want to doif you want to get into hospitalitybusiness say hotels or restaurants youknow go work as a waiter in a restaurantand save all of that money and afterthree years of being a waiter andlearning about it uh learning abouthospitality industry onlineafter three four years of that take allthe money that you would have paid forthe universityand use that to set up your own businessor go as a partner in another businessor somethingand i think there's an enormousthere's an enormous opportunity costthat people have just been conditionednot to think aboutour econ textbook that we teach atuniversity barely mentions opportunitycostfor a very good reason i think ifstudents were made to think of ityou know just think orthink think about what money you pay forthe degreethink about how much of a head start itwould give you in whatever industry youwant to go into if you had that moneyavailable and if you could just learnonline and that's the key thingeven if it's not the same as theexperience of the classroomwhen you get it for a thousandth of thecostthat means you can save all that extramoney and use it to launch your careerto do whatever it is that you want to dothe things that youyou know the destination from theuniversity because the university is notthe destinationno and there's there's a lot of thingsgoing on there as well because but howdo you get the money you're not going tohave it right so you have to go intodebt personally to get the student loansand then you by the time you hit the jobmarketprobably not at the the level you wereeven expecting to hit it at after thatfour years of you know working yourprobably partying your balls off uh toum to get through to college uh you yougenerally feel that by the time you walkaway from thatyou areentitled to somehalf decent paying jobvery very rarely ever happens so youcome out of that with that kind ofpsychological baggage like you know wellwhat the hell just happened there andhow am i 200 000 in debtormaybe mom and dad have paid for itand then that just causes a huge strainon the relationship within the familythere's there's a lot of ummessed up uh relationships where peoplethey've gone to university on mum ordad's dimeand then there's depressionlike the it's real uh especially ifpeople have that kind of tiger mumhanging over them uh you know you've gotto be a lawyer you've got to be a doctorwhatever it isand some people are justcoming away it's so messed up so messedup and then when they get out of collegethey realize well that four yearsi just ground that out this is not whati want to do at alllike not at all do i want to go andfollow this path but that's the phd i'vegot that's the degree i've got so nowthey feel handcuffed and you know kindof painted themselves into a corner thatthey've got to keep following that paththey've got to go and get that in airquotes high-paying jobto start paying off the loan or to atleastkind of validate mom and dad spendingthat money for you in the first place togoit's really damagingand if people have just been given thefreedom of choice to begin with andthey've been able to follow theirpassionsand kind of justfollow their natural bent there's athere's a quote by plato i'll have tofind it umsomething along the lines of[Music]learning under compulsionuh holds uhnothing over the mind or something likethat and uh you know it'sletting people findtheir their passions or their naturalbent i've completely butchered that i'llhave to find it perhaps you can put itin the show notesbut uh it's it's brilliant and that'splatolike you know this is this is not a newthingumbut we forget like school is a new thingschool is an experiment right we didn'thave school 200 years agoit didn't existit isit is not the normwe think it is but it isn't it never wasnever had beenup until the late 18th century but nowhere we are just blindlywalking the lineand sending our kids to school umwithout even thinking about it and youbrought something up earlier as wellabout you know dragging the kids up outof bed at like seven o'clock in themorningshoveling some cereal down their necksputting them onto a bus so they're goingto the school already exhaustedand malnourishedyeahand they get to school and what are theygoing to eat they're probably going toeat the packed lunch that you've packedwhich is a bread sandwich and some kindof chocolate bar and a packet of crispsand a juicy drinkor they're going to go to the schoolcanteen and thengoodness knows what they're going to beum what they're going to be given theremalnourishedexhausted they get homeand then like you said books out carryon with the male nourishmentand the exhaustionit'sa spiral a deaththere's no learning going on ahmarquita thank you the plato quoteknowledge which is acquired undercompulsion has no hold on the mindtherefore do not use compulsion but letearly education be a sort of amusementyou will then be better able to discoverthe child's natural bentnicewhen was plato around anyone know likeyou know this is[Music]yeah there's just there's so muchthere's so muchwrong with it that people aren'tquestioningyeah i think you know one thing about itis that it uh destroys a lot of people'ssense of discipline for life school doesthat there isi can see the point here for the whereyou could say well maybe plato can saysomething like this but most kids thesedaysneed to justshut up and learn their numbers you knowand there is definitely a point therelike there are some things thatsometimes maybeyou know it's it shouldn't all be it'sit's not just a consumer experience it'snot a sensory experienceyou know if you just let kids completelyhave theirwhat their curiosity directs themthey're going to want to learn abouteating ice cream every daythat's going to be what they want soobviouslyyou know the role of a parent or aneducator is tochanneltheir interests in a way that isproductive to try and direct them in away that is useful that can help themask the right questions so that they canget preoccupied in the right things andnot just choose to you know i'm going toeat ice cream all day every day and thatwill be my learningexperience but i thinkthe issue with schooling is thatwhen it's done according to this brutalschedule and this top down directionthen it it doesn't quite teach childrendiscipline in the healthy way teacheschildrendiscipline out of fear it teacheschildren the idea that you do the thingsthat you are supposed to do becauseotherwise you get into trouble and youknow maybe you get chained or you getsuspended fromschool or you get low grades and thenyour parents get angry and there are allthese terrible consequences to notperforming the job in schooland i think for a lot of people you knowwhat screws up their 20sis the fact thatin in their mind as i got out ofuniversity i got out of school i nolonger have to bei no longer have to do what i'm toldand then that takes away the entireconcept of discipline the entire conceptof self-control and so you'll doeverything that you want whenever youwant then you become a child all overagain and i thinkit's it's very commonbecause it teaches kids thatdiscipline and productive work issomething that can only be uhcoaxed out of you orthat you have to be coerced into andthen once you snap out of that thenumonce you're out of the once you're notin a position where somebody can uminfluence you and coax you into actionor threaten you or or cajole you intoactionthen you don't have to do anything soyou just spend all of your dayum being uh just following your basisdesires eating and partying andbut of course i think you knowwhen you do experience that in your 20seventually it catches up to you in oneway or the other you realize you know ifyou don't turn up to work you lose yourjob you lose your money and then youstart building the healthy sense ofdiscipline of understandingdiscipline as freedom understandingdiscipline as just protectingyourself from the negative consequencesof what will inevitably happen if you'renot disciplined and that's the healthyuh approach which i thinkthis is what childhood should be about ithink this is what education should beabout you know if there's anything thatchildren shouldn't do isdevelop thisconception ofdiscipline teach them to develop thisidea of wanting to do the right thingandobviously it's not easy but i think theschool isn't really helping the schoolis uh getting in the way and then thatthey only learn it most of us i thinkonly really learn this stuff in our 20syeah what's going on is obedience rightuh that's that's what's um they're notteaching discipline that's eatingobedienceand peter gray i mean he was braveenough to to come out and uhhe wrote the book free to learnumand actually when he was on my podcasti i calli have a little joke running joke withmy oldest daughter that uh chooses to goto school i call it the local ghoul eggi'm like you knowwhy on earth why on earth do you want togo to that that gulagand it was peter gray that uh thatbrought this up that schools you cancompare a school directly to a prisonuh and in facthe got a lot of for that as you can imagine thatjust triggers a lot of peoplebut then when you think about it and helogically explains it um anybody can goback and listen to that interview withhim uh you know he talks about well youknow if you think about it he's you knowyou you take the kid to school you leavethem at the gate that gate gets lockedat a certain point no parents areallowed on to the the school grounds nochild is allowed to leaveand they are under constant supervisionall day longuh they are only given x amount of freetime to go and playum thethe food is definitely comparable uh andin fact i think uh people who've donestudies on this found that there's morefree time given to inmates than thereare to um to kids in schooland it'swhen when you start thinking about itthat way you're like holythere's that that's so trueandit'sit comes back to the socialization thingagainwhen uh when people talk about you knowschool has to beyou have to send your kids to to schoolso they can socialize you knowit's it's an anti-socialarenabecause like we said you put in to thatclassroom you have no choice you have tosit down and shut up the only chanceyou're going to get to make some kind ofconnection or make some kind of friendsis in that break time 15 minutes 30minutes 45 minutes or an hour maybe atlunch whatever it isbut you generally spend most of thattimeavoiding the people you already know youwant nothing to do withrather than hanging out with the peopleand you would notevergo and talk to the people younger thanyouand you wouldn't ever because that youknow they're below your station youwon't ever go and speak to the peoplehigher than you so you get nichedstamped and packaged within your firsttwo weeks of that schooling um careerand that's you man you're done that isyour nation subset for the whole timethere's nothing social about that andit's just yeah and i think you know at avery basic level we studied this in oureconomics course on safety dean.com youknow society is made up of people whointeract with one another voluntarilyand it's uhcivilization is based on the idea thatwe don't have to know each other but werespect each other's property we respecteach other's bodies we don't take eachother's stuff we don't hurt each otherandwe cooperate when we both agree to it umand that's not what school is so youknow children are not autonomous inschool they'redragged aroundand told what to doin very specific almostmechanistic um terms you know you youstand in line at this time you go in youtake notes you remember this youmemorize that you answer this way youanswer that and it's just a constantexercise insubjugating your willand notum enacting your will not listening toyour will not listening to yourself notletting yourself act the way that youwant it's just a constant subjugationof your willand the thislearned helplessness of understandingthat whatever is going to happen now isgoing to happen because it's beenpredeterminedand your only way of fighting is to getinto trouble basically become a misfityou know either submit or become amisfit basically and become a failureand then get drugs and then have yourparents show up and thenbe treated like you're sick because youdon't want to go along so it's it's it'sa cruel exercise almost in uhdrumming the humanity out of childrenyeah completely um we should probablytalk uh you know about certificationbecause people ask me about yes some ofthe timeumdo you remember when you started yoursafety in.com and you were thinkingabout uh i think someone even asked youis there gonna be a certificate if itake this courseuh and i remember having an emailexchange with you about it and i'm likewell if people want a certificate youcan just download one from the internetand send it to them if you wantand you responded to me it decisionmade there's no way i'm doingcertificatesthat's trueit's true i mean i think i don't knowi'm i'm perhaps revisiting that i mustadmit but like my initialmy initial umin general when i want to do things i'mextremely laser focused in a way thatcan bea little uh funny and absurd and uhinappropriate at timesbutmy idea was i wanted to teach anaustrian economics class and soeverything else was it was details andwhen i just get um taken by the missionof doing something like getting thisclass done the focus is on the missionitself and it's very hard for me tothink of other things and so for me itwas preparing the material for thecourseand all the time that i could spend onpreparing the material is time that iwanted to spend on preparing morematerialandpreparing an exam justdid not strike me as beingintellectually interestingand i just umi iyeah i thinkuhit's uhit doesn't quite make sense to testpeople for many thingsum and i think austrian economics is noteasily conducive to thosekinds of questionsit'si i i thought of these courses beingperhaps more about the individual justlearning for their own sake rather thanfor certification and that's why ihaven't offered any certification butnowsailor.org have bought my course andthey made meaddquestions for it and i must admit it'shelped merethink uhexamination i think there is some valueto itumexamination particular for students totoyou know test their own knowledgebut i think also there's value perhapsin some kind of certificationumultimatelyi had a too much of a reaction againstthe idea of certification based onuniversities because universitiesturned us into something absurd but ithinkyou know brief online course with astandardized testis something that people might benefitfrom adding on to their cv if you canguarantee a specific way of uhof testing andyou know making sure that it can't beeasily hacked as sailor.org doso it can beit might be useful so maybe i've changedmy mind a little bit about thatsoexcuse me um yeah i get asked all thetime well how are your kids ever goingto be able to go to university if theydon't have any qualificationsthis is another myth that's been bustedabout 100 times if not more i'veactually interviewed people that runbusinesses where they helpkids put together in the us it's calleda uh a transcriptbasically a great big folder ofeverything that you've learnedthroughout like yourchildhoodevery book that you've readuh any languages that you've learned etcetc and what generally happens is homeschooled kids and homeschooledhomeschooling parents um[Music]they always play the system slightlydifferently so what they would do ismake appointments to go to the office ofthe administration's officer in theuniversities and actually turn upmake an appointment turn up the thechild and the parent with the transcriptsit down in front of the admissionsofficer go through everything thatthey've done all of their experiencesmaybe they've been world schoolingfamilies and they can just pull up theblog andwe did this we did this this is why wedon't have thetypical sat results and you knowwhatever else they get signed up on thedayone lady she had the admissions officerwalked them down to the photocopier tookuh took picturesandhad everythingphotocopied and signed and whatever elseto come and studytheat the college of their choiceand the subject of their choicenow the reason for that is as anadmissions officer you let that personwalk out youyou're trying to attract people to theuniversity and if you can attractslightly differentforward-thinking people that are gonnabring something else to the universitythen you're gonna take them on straightaway rather than that just stack of satsthat are just sitting there that you youtake a hundred at random and say okayyeah fine you can come you're inuh it'syou should watch actually if you've notalready the college admissions scandalon umon netflixthat gives you a real insight as to howbroken that system is uh in the us forfor people getting into and going tocollege and um theuh like how bad it is for students thatlose outbecause of the scandals that have beengoing on uh for people getting inthat shouldn't have got in at all butlike you say if you make a donation tothe right place or if you use that coachthat's going to get you in the side doorthen um yeah you're all good it'scompletely uh complete nonsenseum i was going to go off on anothertangent umcertificationuh soyeahis there a need for itnois there a want for it yes some peoplewant to have the certificates they liketo havesomething to show for the work thatthey've put inour daughters16 now and 13 this year sat a gcsevirtually set a gcse french exambecausethey can speak french they're fluent infrench and they want the certificate tosaythey want to get the a or the a starthey want thatuh so my wife and i you know we welooked around how can we make thishappenthere are companiesthere's even a remote school here in infrance but which we could use and wecould pay them i can't remember how muchit was it's not stupid and you sit theuh you sit the examyou're online with the uh the the tutorwho's over who who's overwatching it alland then you you send in the the answerswe're currently waiting for the resultsto come out in the next two weeksthere are a hundred different ways youcan make this happen again it comes backto you have a choiceexplore your options do your ownresearch and kind ofdesign the life that is best for you butyou're to come up againsta lot of pushbacka lot of pushback from the socialconstructbecause peopleman they don't mind telling you straightaway that you're a bad parent if you'reeven thinking about doing thisuh because it's justyou face this as a bitcoiner as well youknow you go against the financial legacysystem people are going to look at youlike you're you know a heretic or justsome crazy conspiracy theoristsame with homeschooling me same withhomeschooling alternative schooling ofany sortjust follow the rules just get thecertificates and life will be all rightyou'll get the 2.4 the kid the two carsthe white picket fence and everything'srosy well we all know that'stoosoif you have the choice which you dothenexercise ityeah well the choice is something thatwe might not get to exercise for verylong in many places it's becoming uhincreasinglythe limit of what we can choose is uhbecoming more and more convicted everysingle dayumso in terms ofumchoices so you you still don't reallyhave a very set answer about what tocoverthat's just let the child decide or isthere some kind of curriculum that youaim to cover soum are there some kind of milestones youknow they need to be able to read andwrite by this age they need to be ableto doaddition and subtractionmultiplication algebrahow does that workno there's no there's no set curriculumum they're all reading and writing uhthat that's that's another myth aboutschool you you don't learn to read atschooluh you just don't um you learn how to dothe alphabet and you learn how to youknow copy things off of a blackboard butreadingreading is always learnt in the homereadings learn with mom and dad readingstories together when kids are very verysmall and that love of learning and thatlove of readingshould just be given time to develop umif you think about uhyour homeyou knowyour home your kids are surrounded bybooks all the timeand they have the opportunity to go andpick them up and read them whenever theywant or read them with you or read themwith their older sister or older brotherthey have the opportunity all of thetime in schoolour kidsgot were only allowed to visit thelibrary once a weekand take out one bookthat they had to uh thenbring homewhich they never read because they chosethat book under compulsion and then takeit backit was just completely pointlessuh soumi've lost my train of thought becausei'm not answering the question againthat you're original curriculum so no wewe don't we don't have we don't have anykind of milestones set in place we we douhkind of insist that they're doing thethe math classes each weekand the uh the reading and um excuse methat the writing classes each weekuh with the um with the galileouhotherwisei'm already blown awayuh my second oldest daughter she we wereusing that sameumonline remote school in france here atthe moment she's learning gcse mathsbecause she wanted toso she's she's going through that ican't do those math problems she's doingalgebra and all of this crazy stuff it'sjust completely over my head but uh it'sfun to watch her kind of tackle thatumandwhether she sits that gcse early or notor does another year or two of studybecause she shouldn't even be study uhsitting gcses for another three yearsumbut again you know you can speed thisprocess upas you said the inefficiencies in thesystem are just so crazyum but yeah no to answer your originalquestion no that there's no setcurriculum as far as we're concernedso like how common is it for um childrento fall behind in these kind of settingswhere you know they're 12 and they stillcan't read or they still can't dosubtraction or in addition because youcan see the parents getcaught up in all kinds of things and notfollowing throughor what do you thinkvery rarethere are some cases uh peter gray did astudy of the sudbury valley school in uhin the uswhich uh ben prentice went to actuallymr cool bp from wtf happened in 1971 ohyeahhe is a crazy self-directed educated kidfrom the sudbury valley school uh in uhin massachusetts that schoolyou turn up if you want to turn up youlearn what you want to learn you joinwhat class you want to clap uh you youwant to joinuh and there was a story of a kid therethat umjust wanted to go fish in the pond everyday and uh that was all he didand they just let him do it umthey're they'reand god knows what he's come on to besome some genius of some sort i'm sureuh there are kids some kids don't learnto read until they're 11and then all of a sudden they pick thebook updonegot it done because they needed to andbecause they wanted to and then youcan't stop themhaving having these milestones andtesting kidsuh is is really dangerousuh it can really put a lot ofpsychological baggage on them make themfeel as though they arethickfor one of a better word umandunable to do it for for some reasonsomething wrong with their brain comesback to that againwhereas they're just not naturally readyfor it yetumyeah there'sso much worry out there about it there'sin the uk i know they test kids at likereadingstagesumyou're putting pressure on afive-year-old kidto be reading but at stagex y or z by the age of five by the ageof six and by the age of seven and ifyou're not able to read this book andcomprehend itthen you're behindyou're being told you're thick at theage of five it's likethat's notthat's not teaching or mentoringthat's sortingand it's very disruptiveyeahi mean i i i think i agree i think in umin particular with young kids as yousaid people can stress out too muchabout these early milestones butthey'll read when they need to read andif they're for have you met an adultthat can't readyeahyes there are yeahyeah yeah but have you met themyesyeahyeah there are people who can't read inthe world it has happenedthere are yes but i meanwhat's the percentagei mean i don't know literacy is uhgoing up all the time but there arepeople still can't readis that because they um they they didn'tget to go to school or they didn't theyweren't exposed to booksboth probablyi would say if they were exposed tobooks that would probably just solve theproblemyeah i think you pick up the skills youwant when you need to but yeah if you'renot exposed to books and if you're notexposed to the concept of needing tolearn to read thenyeah these these would be older peoplein general i think younger people willfigure out a way to read very quicklyvery easily these days100 especially if they're online matelike they are all of the timeuh you know playing umplaying things like minecraft or robloxwell you've got a little chat box openand you're playing with your cousinwho's in a different country or adifferent part of the countryand you're chatting to each other in thechat box whilst you're playingpeople think that they're just bummingout doing nothing they're learningthey're look there's a learningopportunity especially uh minecraftwhere you're building stuff yes you'rein a virtual world you might not be outin naturebutyou're in a virtual world you'rebuilding things you have freedom tolearn and you're reading and you'rewriting at the same timebut it just gets it it gets completelyno they're playing computer gameswe've got to stop thatyeahyeah that's uh that's interesting soyou're you would call yourself more ofan unschooler than a homeschooler huhself-directed education umto to home school you have to unschool iwould say because if like i said at thebeginning if you go into it with aschool mindsetand here's the thing here's a warning toparents like you got to get you got toget yourself readyumyou've got to unschool yourself first ofalland you've got to take a very stronglook at what the systemhas done to you in the past how it'saffected you andyour your adult life and your learningopportunities your your career pathbecauseall of itwill tie back tosome positiveor mostly in most caseshighly negative problems that uh thatyou faced in school and that that couldrange fromuhbeing being placed in in bottom sets orbeing bullied or not being able to takeexams because your grades aren't goodenoughor you know justbeing faced against a bad teacherbeing paired with[Music]awful classmatesthere's a lot thereand it'sit's deepand if you umyou you have toyou have to face that down and unschoolyourselfand believeplace place faith back in the process oflearningand trust that the child is learning allof the time all of the timeall of the time even if they're not in ain a lesson they're learningalwaysyou can't stop itunfortunately school triesbut you can't stop he cannot stop a kidlearning uh so if you can get in the waywhen you need toand give them exposure to the tools thatthey need when they're showing interestin something and it could be anything itcould be you know show an interest inlearning to play guitar get on ebay andbuy a guitar for thirty dollars you knowjust put it in their hands don't hire ateacher and send them off to lessonsjust get the damn tool and give it tothemand see if they are going to enjoy itand if it doesn't work out it was 30bucks resell it it doesn't matterbut if it does work out and they'reshowing more interest then go and getthe tutor then they join uma band or a group of other people thatare looking to uh to play and that'sreal socialization yeahright that's socialization football issocializationyou know my son plays for a local teamthat's where his friends arehe doesn't have friends out of a schoolhe has friends from his football clubbecause they love footballand they depend on each other whenthey're playing in the team and so theycreate this camaraderie with each otherand they socialize with each other theygo to each other's birthday parties usedtouh you know this umthat that socializationuh getting in the way as a parentwhen you need to to provide the toolsfor a kid that show an interest insomething is hugely importantyeah i think this is uh this is the uhthe first response i have for thesocialization question iswell you know that's not preparing forsociety society is a place where peopledeal with each other voluntarilyand i think the follow-up isjust because the kid doesn't go toschool doesn't mean they're not going tosocialize they're going to socializein settings that are more similar towhat they do in life in other words theyget to that they decide willingly andvoluntarily to joinsome kind of uh organization and settingwhere they want to be part so it couldbe we go onyou know we join a soccer team we goswimmingwe go sailing we go hiking in themountains you know you get together withlike-minded people who want to dosomething similar you go takephotographsor you know you learn chemistry you goto somebody's house to learn chemistryfrom them or you go and learnmath from somebody who's really smart atmath and who gives less australianeconomics or austrian economics yeahexactly how do you guys like theseweekly calls like seriously everybodyhere on this call we've been turning upfor god knows how long like it's like atherapy session each week it's brilliantbut like you and i would not have met ifyou didn't set that upand i turned it straight because iwanted to learn and you showed upbecause you wanted to teachand so did all the other guys so nowwe've got likehow many now safe like 20 30 40 peopleyou know on any weekuh that are showing up and socializingwe socializeyou know not all of these calls arerecorded right sometimes we're justhanging out and bullshitting uh thisthis is huge this you formed a socialgroup and we come we socialize and welearn at the same time without evenrealizing we're learning sometimesyeah and it's because it's voluntary andthat's why it's everybody behaves in acivilized way because everybody realizeseverybody else hasa choice about whether they want to behere or not and so if youbehave in a way that is anti-socialyou alienate others they either kick youout or they stop coming in and so thenthe whole thing is gone so people have avery different mentality you know it'sinteresting that the kids willbully each other and will get bullied inschoolbut then youmove them to another setting where theyinteract with each other in uhlike in say university or in placeswhere they're uh or at work and thatdynamic disappears because they'redealing with each other in a voluntarysettingand this kind ofsomebody who's there who's stuckandthis kind of antagonistichostility towards one another disappearswhen you take them out of that settingyeah completely and uh yeah did you seewhat lindley said in the uhif we are socializing here does thatmake us socialist[Laughter]uh yeah umthere'si don't know man umis there anything leftuh did did we take everything off uhi've got a few uma few uh tools if people want to use itumactually there's another quote from sirken robinson if youyou can't ask an eight-year-old child tosit down and do low-grade clerical workfor eight hours a day and not expectthem to get boredand it's justperfectfive days a weekyeah you knowlike that's crazy but there are sometools that the listeners can check outuh if they want to do their own researchumjohn holt uh he wrote a book i think itwas in the 50s he's very well known asprobably the the foundingfather of the homeschooling movementcoming out of the u.syou can find his books pat farengacarried on his workat john holt gws.comuh naomi fisher's book changing ourmindshold on to your kids by gabor matethat's that's where i kind of likestarted picking up on all of thepsychological and traumatic kind ofdamage it does to kidsand he does a brilliant job of outliningthat in his bookand he tackles the social problem aswellthere's a few films that you guys mightbe able to find on the internetuh made by jeremy stewart uh one iscalled class dismissedand the other one is called self taughtumplenty of other tools which i can sharewith peter to put in the show notes aswell fantastic

of it umyou've done an incredible incredibleservice to so manytens hundreds of thousands of people andi can't imagine how many more people aregonna learn from you and be orangepeeled by your book and everything elsethat you're doing your other two booksare coming out soreally appreciate everything you've donemassive massive thank youthank you sir thank you very muchappreciate you coming on i appreciateyour words thanks a lotcheersall right hello and welcome to anotherbitcoin standard podcast seminar today'stopicis homeschooling and our guest is aregular seminar attendee uh here atseijidin.comdaniel prince host of the once bittenbitcoin podcastand all-round excellent bitcoiner whosebeen churning out great quality bitcoincontentregularly and joining us here on theseminar alwaysumyou you've definitely heard him ifyou've listened here beforedaniel also wrote a book called chooselife and in it he describes hisadventures of uh quitting the rat raceand uhfocusing on homeschooling his kids andtraveling the worldand uh livinga free life with which uh i thinkbitcoin has uh arguably helped him quitea bitso daniel has for a long timebeen uh giving me a lot of prohomeschooling propaganda and it issomething that i am uh generally uhfavorable to myselfuh so i thought we'd have an extensivediscussion here on the topic ofhomeschoolingand um we're gonna have follow this upwith the next discussion in a couple ofdayson fiat education and the problems offiat education so daniel thank you forjoining usthanks for inviting me on safe reallyglad to be here i'm i'm hoping thatpropaganda hashelped in some wayit has it has so umi mean it's definitely inching me closerand closer towards the choice ofhomeschoolingso could you uh i guess make the overallcase for whyyou think somebody should considerhomeschooling their kidsyou know schools are out therewe get professionals to doeverything for us professionals buildour computers they make our furniturethey build our housesand you can't expect to be able to begood at everything so why notletspecialization do its job with childrenvery good question umthe the the overriding kind of uh pointthati think people should really understandis that they have a choicemost people don't even realize that inthe first place they just thinkschool is the be-all and the end-all andthis is the only thing that they haveavailable to them which just isn't thecase it hasn't been the case for formany decades and it certainly isn't thecase now with the rise of the internetand information technology uh onlineschooling and what elsethere are so many different ways thatyou can look and think abouteducating your children that you wouldactually becrazy to not consider themyeah i think it uh definitely makessense and i think umthe uhthe possibilities that are available fora parent today compared to what theywere just 20 or 30 years ago is uhis very different in factparticularly over the last two years andas it seems now you know this permanentnew world in which we livein which kids going to school is goingto bea luxury of a few weeksevery year while they spend the rest ofthe yearglued into zoomis making it look you know no matterwhere you are in the world it's lookingincreasinglyuh well not know there are a few placesthat are holdouts for freedom floridaand texasum belarus a few other places around theworldbut generally most people are prettymuch stuck with uhhomeschoolinguh one way or the other you know even ifyou don't want to homeschool you aregoing to be homeschooling you're goingto have toset them up with a zoom office andhave themjoin their teachers and their classmatesat the specified timesand follow up with all of the worksoit's almost becoming inevitable thatyou're having to use that and then ofcourse when you think about justthe amazing possibilities of what is outthereit kind of makes sense but then againisn't it better for a person to just goand do their job rather thantry and learn how to do the job of anelementary school teacher i mean thesepeople specialize in doing this year inyear out 20 years 30 years they've gotthe experience they've handled kids theyknow their problems they know what theyneedand you know you're good at other thingsyou've done other things in your lifeand you're better off going and mininguh bitcoin by doing another job and thenpaying professionals for the handling ofyour kidsyeah absolutely mate and um to to uhlike you know dwell on the point thatyou were making there about uhthe the schooling from home which hasbeen going on ever since uh covet hituh that is very different um to tohomeschooling what homeschooling is is acompletely different mindsetuh around the education of the kid it'salmosthomeschooling probably shouldn't even bethe word because it's not school at homea lot of people there are so manydifferent terms for it mate that uh it'sbecome a little bit of a kind of a nichewithin a nicheuh some people like to say that they'reunschoolers other people like to saythat they're you know they're followinga self-directed education kind of pathwhich is probably what we're doingin fact because we use uh galileo i knowa lot of people have listened to theshow and heard me talk about that andthey've heard lauren on the showand she talks about it and she sometimeshas to run off and sign into a differentclubssotraditional homeschoolingthat people have in their mindsisschool at home and that is what peoplehave been exposed to since we werelocked down due to coronaand it's hell and it doesn't workbecauseyou are nottrained and you don't have the time todo all of that and you don't have the umthe will to follow like the umthe fear uh education curriculum becauseyou soon find out yourself god damn thisis boring is all helland you just know that you're spinningyour wills and you knowbut in fact the first thing that happensuh when you do this and my wife and i wemade this first mistake when we firststarted to travel in 2014the first thing we didwascreate a timetablefor our home schoolingand it would be like 9 a.m we'll get upand we'll do some uh some reading andwriting and 10 a.m we'll have a breakand at 10 30 a.m we'll do some some kindof math andabsolute disasterbut every homeschooling parent goesthrough the same kind of learning curvebecause you realizethat youthat is only ever going to workin a schooling system where it iscompulsory that that compulsion is thereand that set timetable is there and youhave the um the system set in place andthe teachers are gonna have you sat downand opening the books and the bell isgonna have you moving when it's whenyou're supposed to and then um you knowcome the end of the day eight hoursdisappears and you can leave again andthen go homefirst thing you do when you get home iswhat sit at a kitchen table eat somekind of unhealthy snackopen your homework books and spend thenext three or four hours doing morehomeworkthat systemitself is a disaster when you bring thathomeand you try and replicate that system athomethere's no way in the world that's evergoing to work there is an immediatebreakdown between parent and childbecause you're trying to force a systemthat is completelyuh alien to the um to the home and it'sjusta complete messbuteveryone when they first start they willdo thisyou can't stop yourself because we areso programmed it's sopsychologically drummed into us we'veall been systemizedpossibly since the age of five dependingwhich country you came from maybe evenearlier we've all been through it andwe're all carrying these um traumatraumas uh throughout our schoolingcareer that um we'vebeen exposed to and have to carry thatbaggage into our adult lifeand that's another real big problem whenyou sit downand you start trying to help the kidswith certain problemsand that problem is out of your scope ofintellectyou shut downand you start getting angry and youstart getting anxiousand this is a big problem that we seewith homework when kids come home andthey need homework help from uh fromtheir parents but their parents suddenlyrealizethis is likeno way i was ever taught how to do thismy 20 years ago so they've changed theway that they're teaching kidsthere's no way i can get to the answerthat they want you to get to using themethod that they are usingand then you have this horriblebreakdown again within the familyuh i've rambled there i can't rememberyour exact question in the beginning buti think that's a very great answer of uhyou know why not just hand it over to uhprofessionals well umwell actually no this isn't much of ananswer this is this is an argument forhanding them over to professionals iguess but you you made a good pointabout uhwhy this kind of uh environment is isnot goodand i think yeah i think i agree i thinkum one common objection you hear tohomeschooling is people will say wellthis is terrible preparation for livingin societyyou've got to go to school and you'vegot to be socialized but in realitysociety is not like that society is notyou and 30 people in one roomand doing what other people have decidedfor you to do and you just need to keepfollowing instructions and you'rerewarded for how well you followinstructionsthis isnot lifegenerallythis is life for students at school andit's if it's useful preparation for alife it's useful preparation forthe life of the militaryor for the life of a slave or for thelife of somebody who's essentiallyemployedwith no regard to their will it's it'sit's about what others want you to doand it's umto an extent it is reflective of theoffice environment and i thinkthis isn't this isn't goodsocialization i think the people who saythisumbetray a very warped view of whatsociety is like if you think school isgood preparation for societyi thinkyou misunderstoodyou're using your society wrong i thinkyou need to go back to theshop and ask them how to dealyou know how to actually use societyproperly because it's not similar toschool society is not meant to be aplace where you're constantly beinggiven orders andtreated with no regard to what you wantthis is i think the key thing about theschool systemsocialization fudd is the number onethat's that that's that's the boilingthe oceans of of uh homeschooling andit's so tiring and you've just nailed itand theo's just said in the chat anyonethinking that homeschooling doesn'tprepare for life in society never met ahomeschooled child that is so true and icannot like emphasize that pointhard enough every homeschooled kid i'vemet or world-schooled kid or unschooledor self-directed whatever you want tocall it has blown me awayand it was the early ones that we met inour travels that really started uhshaping my thinkingthat about you know having made theright decision becausewe were constantly questioning ourdecision like what the hell are weactually doing i've just quit my jobwhich you know was a good fiat miningjob we've just left a country we'd livedin for 15 years we've got four kids agedunder eightand we're just bouncing around the worldwith them like doing whatever the hellwe like and just enjoying freedombut at the same time using theseexperiences to uh layer on learningopportunities and education just in anexperiential way rather than thecompulsory wayand meeting meeting the um the othertravelers because you you find yourtribewhatever you're doing you find themonline twitter facebook wherever and youyou do a beach meetup or a city meet-uppark meet-up wherever you are andmeeting these other families kids i waslike ohman we're doing the right thinglook at these kidsthey're you know that they would come upto us they would shake me by the handlook me in the eye even if there wassevenand like introduce themselves and then iwould sit down and have a conversationwith themthey were just so adept totalking to anybody of any age of anyculture of any race of any colorof any sexi couldn't believe it whereas if youmeeta typical 13 to 15 year old completelycompulsory schooled umteenageryou getglam they won't even look at youmost of the timethey might just say hello and then kindof look to the floor or i mean you knowsoak off into the corner and go on totheir device or something they don'twant to be part of you becauseto themthe adult in the room is the authoritythe adult in the room is not to beconversed withthe adult in the room is not to beplayed withthe adult in the room is just there tobe the authority to tell them what to doif they decide to that they need them todo somethingandthat is not social now in my book um idid uh i did try and bust the myth ofsocializationand um there if you look in thedictionary there's twouh definitions of the word uh socializenumber one is mixed socially with otherswhich is what people think is happeningat schoolthey honestly think that by sending yourkidinto schoolto be aroundkidsgenerally the exact same age as themfrom the exact same town as themmore often than not the same race asthemthatthey are going to find friends andsocialize no problemnow we all know that that hardly everhappenswe all know that you get crammed intorandomly crammed into uh groups of 25 30people whether or not you have anythingin commonlike uh with these guys or girls at alland you're forced to sit with themin silence for the next five to sevenyears whatever it isand you're not allowed to converseand i guessso i tell people all the time it's likewhen theythey complain oh my god my my son or mydaughter they get home from school thefirst the first thing they dois get on the phone to their friends andthen they're just on the phone to theirfriends for like four or five hours yeahblah blah blah blah blah i'm like wellwhy do you think that is well i've beenwith them all day so i mean why did ihave to keep on yeah they've been withthem all day but they've not been ableto speak to them not oncemaybe 15 20 minutes at recreation butotherwise they're sat next to each othersure but they're not talking to eachother they're not sharing ideas they'renot thinking big picture thinkingthey're sat down they're quiet andthey're listening to the flapping headat the front of the roomuh the otherum the other definitionuh is um for socialization is makesomeone behave in a way that isacceptable to their societyyeah which is exactly what you justhighlightedum and that's what's going onthey are just literally teaching kidsto be subservientto not question authorityand to beone of the massesand this is the problem that we arefacing in society todaypeople think entrepreneurs are theselike amazing you know megaminds uh youknowtake big risks and on whatever else andgo and build huge amazingbusinesses i would argue that's actuallythe default mindset of any human beingand as sir ken robinson quotesuh he believes strongly that umwe get educated out of creativityyeah it's just not allowedyou know that the teacherhasto indoctrinate that set of kidsto the answerthat the curriculum calls forso that is indoctrination to the answerandwe peel that onion back a little furtherwho creates the curriculum and who'slooking for the answers we all know thatit's a top-down structure it's made byeducation ministers unelected educationministers bureaucratsthey create the education they createthe um curriculumthat gets pushed down onto the governingbodies that gets pushed down onto theschools that gets pushed down onto theheadmaster or mistress that gets pusheddown onto the teacher and that getspushed down onto the kids i meanrolls downhill like there's never abetter analogy than that so the teachersare just as stuck in the systemas the kids they do not have controlover the classroom they can't teach tothe schedule that they want to teachthey have to teach the exact schedulethat curriculum calls forthey can't be creative in any waybecause they have to indoctrinate thekids to the answer that the curriculumcalls forthey've lost control and they are justas beaten up by the system as the kidsare they've just pretty much becomeuh heavily umadministrated or administrative um headsat the front of the class that are justbasicallygrinding out 30-year career so they canget to the end of it walk away and havetheir pensionand that's a disaster in itself becauseteachers and mentors they need spacethey need creativity they want toconnect with kids that's why they gointo teachingto have that ability taken away from youis a real travestyyeahit's uhit's uh i've noticed this uh i thinkeducation all around the world hasgenerally become a lot more formulaicand centralizedand standardized over the past few yearsand i hear stories about it just uh youknow it's it's about getting the rightanswer using the right way that theywantand the right answer is how they thinkof it it's not about it being uh makingsense it's not about being correctum in any practical sense and i think uhyou know one thing you alluded to is thefact that they get back home and theywant to talk to their friends anotherthing that they do when they get backhome is they want to do homework which ifoundabsolutely uhinsanereally i mean youyou you wake them up early in themorning you drag them out of bed you getthem dressed and you send them off to aplace where they would learn and theycome back and they still need to do morelearning it seems to me it doesn't justseem to me i've gone through this uhhellscape for 12 years i know what i'mtalking about i i remember you know youcan imagine how insufferable i must havebeen as a 14 year old having to gothrough school and you know my parentsand my teachers suffered a lotwith me explaining to them you know whythis is just so stupidand i was there i used to remember justhow much of the day what would go towardlearning new things i rememberi it was around 9th or 10th grade wherei would keep trackby the minute of how many minutes wespent learning new useful informationduring that dayand it wasalmost always i'm not almost always itwas always under an hour of new stuffbecausethat that's the only kind of real newlearning that you do because the rest ofthe day you're going over old stuffor you'repreparing for an exam or you'rejust engaged in all kinds ofrepetitive exercises repeatingthe same kind of thingbut you've gonethrough the enormous hassle ofgetting all these kids shipped off toone location which is always alogistical nightmare you knowgetting them all in safely into the sameplace on buses or carsall of them to come in together andall that they do is learn a very fewthingsand then they go home and they need togo home and they need to study on theirown because they have to learn on theirown they have to spend their time doingtheir homeworkand it's uh it's it's an enormous wasteand if you think about itwhat kids do in the summeruh when they're free from school ends upbeing the most memorable and mostmosteven educational things that they dobecause in the summer they could takecare advantage of this and actually goout and explorenature explore life get a summer jobyou know live like members of societyrather than uh membersof uha weird cultum they can actually go out there youknow and help somebody in their shop anduh make a little bit of money and thenbuy something with it it's it's it'sit's very educational so life itself isum it has a lot to offer for everyoneand definitely has a lot to offer forchildren who have seen so little of lifeso just getting them out there toexperience life for me isisis extremely valuable and schoolprevents that from happeningand it doesn'tdo it it doesn't take up a lot of timebecause it's worth it it takes up a lotof time because it's inefficient i usedto thinkum if i was uhdoing theif i was doing the curriculum on myspeedit would take a lot less time and ithink it's true for most kidsgenerally becauseclasses generally have to go at thespeed of theslowest kidsandon the one hand you have that but theneven perhaps more important than thatit's justthe inefficiencies of having to geteverybody on the same pageand then switching them up you knowwhere you have to go from chemistry tomathematics toall these different subjects in 50minute intervals and get the kids tosnap out of this topic and get into thattopic and move the kids around or movethe teachers around it's just umthere's a lot of inefficiency involvedin it as opposed to just letting thekids figure out what they want andsupervising the learning i can see i candefinitely see the benefits of havingprofessional teachersbut i don't see the benefits of thisindustrial scale modeli can see i think it'sit's doneprimarily to the benefit of[Music]government and organizations that wantto have peopleturn intouseful docileorder takersin the second degree it is beneficialfor children for parents becausethey get a lot of free time withouthaving to deal with their childrenand it'srelatively cheapalthoughi mean public schooling is cheap butprivate schooling is expensive butit's definitely not in the interest ofthe student i think if theif the student had the meansof an adult who would be willing to givethem some time and attention they coulddo a lotwith their timethey could learn much more efficientlywhat do you think of that in terms ofjust the efficiency of learning the uheducational material whatever it isfirst of all it shocks me to learn thatyou were questioning authority at theage of 14 soand uh sort through the inefficienciesof the industrial beast that it is butyou know you're so right it's daycarelike let's call it what it is straightup it's daycare and that's going totrigger a few people oh no it's not youknow you knowman like that the best meme they evercame up with was free education is ahuman rightthat is a meme it's a tagline and it'svery very powerful and people repeat itand they repeat it and they repeat itand then as soon as they um they feellike well free education is a humanright then bam i've got to put my kidsinto school i've got to put my kids intothat education systembut well they didn't what they didn'ttell you like the small print of thatmeme was as long as we have the abilityto teach them whatever we want wheneverwe want and this is where we have likethe nationalistic curriculums indifferent countries around the worldand again people are going to be likewhat's he talking about there's no wayit's nationalistic well you know check ahistory curriculum in any differentcountry you'll find a very nationalisticbias towards that country uh in americai believe they still um stand up eachmorning and pledge allegiance to theflag i mean if that's not nationalistici don't know what else is in singaporeour kidswe schooled them across differentschools when they went to state schoolthey played the national anthem everymorning at 7 30 a.m when you're expectedto be at the school gates if you werewalking across the playgroundwith your child take them into the classand the first bar of the national anthemstarted yet stand still man[Music]rain or shineno walking whilst the national anthemplayed it's mental when you think aboutit and it is just daycare you're soright it's because it frees up and weall know whythere was a huge push back in um wellafter the50s and 60s a huge push to push womeninto the workplaceand againtotally agree with you know ladies youwant to go on work absolutely 100 butthat was infiltrated andfor a very good reasonpeople werewomen were aggressively pushed into theworkplacebecauseyou suddenly become a taxpayer your taxbase goes upby a lot if you've now got women in theworkplace so what do you do you lay ondaycare daycare is state educationunder the guise ofeducationis uh free education as a human rightso you have these inefficiencies in thesystem that you're talking about thesekids like you're sayingmaybe you're 12 maybe you're in a mathclass and it's just clicking what you'retalking about that day you're justgetting itthen the bell goes and you're afterhistoryyou can never get in a flow stateeverit's it's crazyit's just not the way we learn as humanbeings we just do not learn that way welearn when we're involved in somethingeverybody listening to thiswill attest to the fact they've listenedto thousands of hours of bitcoinpodcasts they've read all the booksthey've read all the articles they'vewatched all the youtube videostheir own timeand i have no idea how many hoursthey've done doing it because they'vebeen so involved in it they're in thatflow state they're interested in the uhthe materialand they're going to learn they're justgoing to naturally learn that's howhuman beings learnnot in short sharp bursts of 45 minutesor an hour and a half if it's a doubleperiodlistening to the flapping headwho's disinterested just as much as thekids because they're thinking about thenext period and maybe they've got the 15year olds coming in next and they've gotpreparing mentally in their mind what'sthe next part of the curriculum for themit's it's such a broken systembut very few peopleever want to challenge it the systemnever gets challengedeverwhat happens instead is really insidiousit's the kid's faultthere's something wrong with the kidand if there's something wrong with akid that blame gets pushed onto theparents it's the parent's faultso the parents get pushed uh pulled intoschoolyour son can't sit stillhe's he's eightwell there's something wrong with himand we can't have him disrupting therest of the classso now it's the parent's fault and naomifisher talks about this in her bookchanging our minds it's a brilliant bookand she talks about umthe blame or brainum phenomena that phenomenon thathappens when you're faced with this as aparent it's like well i'm gonna blamemyselfwhich is very very difficult to do as aparent because you know you've doneeverything you can for your childit's just naturalor there's something wrong with thebrainand so then what happens oh there'ssomething wrong with our kid then youget pushed into this corner ofbegging for a diagnosis of somethingjust give me a diagnosis so that we knowwhat's wrong with our childwhen there's nothing wrong withthe kid at all it's the systemwe have got thisdespicable problemwhere adhd or is called something else ithink in the inner statesadhd or add i i don't know um thatthere's yeahwe're pumping kids full of ritalinbecause they can't sit still in aclassroom they're bored out of theirheads withit'smay i i cannotstate how angry that makes meyeah it's insane i think there's anenormous amount of money that is beingmade from um medicating normal humanreactions toall kinds of things it'sit'sinstead of thinking about what is is inthe environment that is driving peopleto do these uh dysfunctional behaviorsuh the idea is nope it's got to besomething chemical and so let's justgive them some drugs and that'll fix itand of courseeducation isis contributing to that uh particularsales funnel quite prolifically it's andit's astonishing the number of peoplethat um have their lives uhtaken over almost by a dependency on adrug from a very young ageand it's uh pretty difficult to beat itbut i mean some people do beat it butit's not easy to get over thisthat it'sit's absolutely insane because when youthink about it yeahthe the kids don't want to sit still inclass because they want to do otherthings you know they do have other ideasof what they'd like to do and all theseother things that they interest themthey could develop intolearning opportunities or they coulddevelop into careers or they coulddevelop into lifelong passions soletting the child have the freedom toexplore and learn what they want willeventually drive them in the directionof wanting to learn you know whatever itis that the child is interested in solet's say they like uh sports carsso then they get into sports cars theyspend their time pursuing their interestin it and then they realize well if youwant to work in sports carsyou need to learnmath and you need to understandengineering andthat means there are certain things youneed to learn here are some booksread this book and you'll be able tomaybe one day get a job making thesecars or designing them and that's that'sgoing to get the passion of the child tostart spending an enormous amount oftime on this and if you look at peoplethatexcel in many fields you find that theyhad that freedom growing up wheretheir school was almost turned into asecondaryconcernbecause they were spending their timethe majority of their timegoing after this one passion of theirsand it could be becoming an athlete itcould be studying a topicit could be performingmusic orall kinds of thingsor it could be just a highly umspecialized skilled job which they growinto say like a graphic designer or aprogrammer or umall these things you know people end uppursuing themwith passion outside of school hoursbecause they'd love them they enjoy themthey want to learn they want to getbetter at them and you see it and yousee people doing this all through theirlife andumfor childrenit'sit's just a very big waste of time toengage in this in my opinion in thisformulaicsystem ofperforming rituals in order to get toeducationwhenyou could be umdirecting yourself towards the thingsthat you want and i still think you knowyou need adult supervision but i don'tthink you need adult supervision in theform of being shuffled into one buildingwith hundreds of peopleandsubject tostandardized testing and having yourschedule hijacked for an entire day foressentially ninemonths of the yeari don't think that's the guidance theyneed i think kids could use a lotmore individualist guidance and i seei see perhaps the value in havingclasses but i don't thinkit makes you know i can see how uh itwould make sense to hire somebodyto um you know hire a bunch of kidsfor a bunch of kids parents to gettogether and hire somebody who's good atchemistry to give them good chemistryclassesbutyou know having it as part of an entirecurriculum along with other topicsisjust asking for troubleif you start systematizing it and if youstartforcing all thesescheduledevelopmentaround the topicit turns it intoit turns it into a shore basically andthen it knocks out the curiosityyeah 100 it's funny you you mention asports car driver for examplefangio the best sports car driver of alltimebecame the best he attributes the factthat he became the best sports cardriver of all time becausewhen he was a teenager i think hisfather wanted him tobe a doctor or something or you know theclassic doctor lawyer or financewhatever he just wanted to work withcars and he would go and work in thelocal garages for free evenand he got a very very intimateunderstanding of the mechanics of a carto the point where he was driving uh informula one he could still strip andrebuild that enginenow there's a reason he became thenumber one driver in the world of alltimebecause of when he was a kid he got lostin that learning and he became part ofthat whole experience with his hands hewas learning from his mistakesyou know that's not something you canlearn in a classroomlike if you'd have taken mechanical likeuh sports car racing mechanical lessonsfor 45 minutes once a weekit would not have had the same resultsuh it's um yeah and even if he studiedmechanical engineering at universitylevel which i didumto be perfectly honest i mean it's uha lot of it is just a bunch of equationsthat they tack onumlater butif iwanted to go out there and get a sportscar to actually workpretty muchmost or 90 of what i'd need to know tomake the sports carworki wouldn't have learned in mechanicalengineering and 90 of what i learned inmechanical engineering is not going tobe relevant to making that sports carworkit's relevantand useful formaking exams and forhaving a curriculum andyou knowto give credit i think it's useful in uhfiltering peoplein terms of conscientiousness and workethicin thatyou can't get an engineering degreeunless you have the ability to sit downand spend several hourstackling a problemum and thinking about it andthinking really hard about how to solveitso you seethere is some value perhaps in that inin screening for employees but it's anenormously inefficient wayof screening you know you you you couldget a much bettermore efficient way of screeninguh for these things without having to gothrough all these very elaborate ritualsbut yeah i think um it's it's verydifferent in that sense so so tell usthenhow do you go about it so you don't dothe curriculum you don't have math anduhyou don't have a set hour for math sothen what do you do they just party allday yeah exactly[Laughter]well we've got four kids and this isanother thing you got to remember likeeach kid is completely different we havetwins made completely different like uhtotally different work ethic totallydifferent interests totally differentlearning style completely different soif they're in the same classroomtogether which we've experienced they'vebeen in the same classroom togetherwe'll get good reports for one and mereports for the otherthat's not like it drives me crazybecause you knownow all of a sudden that theirpersonalities are being judgedrather than their um their abilities andtheir abilitiesuh as we knowas their parentsjust found in different areas and if oneof those um abilities isn't beingaddressed in a classroom then um thenthey're gonnaperform badly in the eyes of the of theteacherum soright now uh our 16 year old uh shechooses to go to schoolshe uses the education systemwe are in france and when we when wetraveled we traveled for two and a halfyears doing the world schoolinguh we took a break we tookum a long-term rental in franceand we wanted the kids to learn anotherlanguage and we knew the only way thatwe could do that was to immerse them soagain it comes back to the originalpointchoiceyou have a choice you can dowhat you want and what you need to dowhen you see the opportunity arise sothere was a montessori french school anda little hamlet we put the threeyoungest ones in therelet's try this out for a weekthey were the school were really happyto bring them onand the kids really enjoyed ituh my oldest one went to uh theuh the older school uh the umit's called elysee here uh collegeexcuse menowthe the younger three they're all backout and they are using uh what'swe call a self-directed educationplatform that's galileogalileo.galileoxp.com and the way thatworks is because it's self-directededucationkids are in charge of making thedecisions of what clubs they want tojoinso they take a look at the clubs eachmonth the clubs get mixed up there aresome that just runall year round like the math class runsall year round science classesuh english writing classes run all yearround which they do and which they enjoydoingthefun there's a coding coding class thatruns all year round as wellso you decide um and then they havethese monthly clubs that they just popup it'll beuh there might be a club on um trying tothink of the most recent onesuhanthropology or archaeology or uh youknow just studying amphibians forwhatever reason uh and somebody willcome on and run that club for the kidsto join if they're so interested so whatyou get is a teacheron a zoom call with 10 to 15 kids thathave chosen to be there they're therefor a reason the teacher's there for areason and so you have a much betterlearning environment straight awayuh somy kids daysthey uh they start around nine to ninethirtythey log on to their zoom coursethey do their their morning meetingcheck in with the usual bunch of guysfor 30 minutesthen they'll go and make themselves somebreakfast generally egg and bacon my sonloves a breakfast burrito can't stop himeating themand then they have the rest of the daythey might have a couple of hours wherenothing's going onuh so they might um hang out with methey might be doing something with mumbut then like 11 o'clock they'll have abook nook uh meeting where that'senglish literature for example they'llbeplaying games learning about englishlearning about grammarwith the the english teacheruh maybe this afternoon i think theyhave a debate club which is hosted by anadultand he will pick a topic each weekand split the guys into twoand debate a subject whether it's acurrent event or an existing event orjust a made-up hypothetical eventand uhthat's been a really good experienceactually the kids all love that onethey've now started a few languageclassesumand the the cool thing is they they pluginto all of these different tools thatare already available orum starting to launch on the internetso if there are so many differentplatforms starting nowlikewe talk in the uh the bitcoin spaceabout how corona has sped up the worldby about 10 years right did the shiftthe move to online or alternativeeducation what did you want to call itis happening so damn quickly and i knowyou're involved with sailor.org sothat'sa perfect example of what how that isgoing to make university almostseem obsoleteor seem at least at least give youat least give you an option do i want tospend 200 grand or do i want to go andlearn what i want at my own paceon this on this platform over hereso we we've we've captured it all nowfrom from 8 to 18 you have platformslike galileo where you can learnwhatever you want self-directed findwhat you're interested in and thenyou'll have something like sailor.orgwhere you can really start knucklingdownand even i think michael sailor saidthey're hoping in the next couple ofyears to even become fully accredited soyou'll be able to graduate you knowquotes from that online university withthe accreditation that you need to goout into the marketplace and startlooking for workthis this is hugethis is massiveyeah it's insane i think the uh you knowwe i was just discussingsailor.org with michael saylor a coupleof days ago on twitter spaces and i'mgoing to be releasing this as a podcastin fact it's probably going to be out bythe time this one's outand it's it's amazing they're closing inon a million students they're going tohave their millionth student comingjoining them in the next month or soandwhen you think about it you know thecost of getting an education for astudent there think about all of themoney that they've spent on sailor.orgsince conception until todayfor a million students you know it'sgoing to be i would imagine probably atmost 20 bucks a student if 20 million isthe total amount of spending maybesowhatever it is it's not going to be morethan a hundred so it's it's a hundreddollars maybe it could be as little as adollar i don't exactly know how they runit on the back end and how much has costbut it's a million students forcewhat is definitely less than 100 dollarsper studentum and then you think about universitiesyou know traditional universities whoare always looking for donations thinkabout how much your money can go thereso you could donate to one of theseuniversities two hundred thousanddollars and you would give one studentan education whereas if you donate maybea hundred dollars to sailor.org or fiftydollars or ten dollarsyou'd give a student um an education andi thinkuh you know it might be much less thanthat um in inin all likelihoodso the efficiencies involved areenormous and it's umlikei think there are definitely advantagesto the personal uh experience ofeducation where you go to a classroomand interact with others sure it'sdefinitely nicer thansitting in front of a screenbutit'syou knowyou have to think about you have toweigh all of thecosts and benefits of both decisions inorder to come out all with an answerof which is better because you'll getthe vast majority of the benefits of thelecture whether you're watching it on uhonline or if you're watching it inpersonand then with the money that you saveyou know if you go to sailor.org and thewhole thing costs younothing basically just the internetconnection and electricitywell if you want to get the certificateyou need to pass the courses there's anactual exam that you have to pay forthere's a hundred dollar fee orsomething because you're going to payfor somebody to proctor you while youtake the exam so it'll cost yousomething but practically it rounds downto zero it's it's a rounding error nextto the cost of going to a regularuniversity so now think about theopportunity cost of the going to theuniversity is it really worththat extraumpersonal interaction you get fromsitting in the classroomis it really worth having all that moneyavailable for you to invest inumsomething that you enjoy umworking on after you graduate i thinkthis is really the key thing i used tosay this to my students when i was auniversity professor and it wouldseriously make them questionstaying in university which is you knowlike umwhatever it is that you want to dowhatever job you want to get you knowthink about all the money that you'reputting at universityand spend the next spend the years ofuniversity learning on your own onlineand learning on the job in whatever jobyou want to do so let's say you want togo intoa graphic design you know go and get ajob in graphic design and learn onlineor if you want to doif you want to get into hospitalitybusiness say hotels or restaurants youknow go work as a waiter in a restaurantand save all of that money and afterthree years of being a waiter andlearning about it uh learning abouthospitality industry onlineafter three four years of that take allthe money that you would have paid forthe universityand use that to set up your own businessor go as a partner in another businessor somethingand i think there's an enormousthere's an enormous opportunity costthat people have just been conditionednot to think aboutour econ textbook that we teach atuniversity barely mentions opportunitycostfor a very good reason i think ifstudents were made to think of ityou know just think orthink think about what money you pay forthe degreethink about how much of a head start itwould give you in whatever industry youwant to go into if you had that moneyavailable and if you could just learnonline and that's the key thingeven if it's not the same as theexperience of the classroomwhen you get it for a thousandth of thecostthat means you can save all that extramoney and use it to launch your careerto do whatever it is that you want to dothe things that youyou know the destination from theuniversity because the university is notthe destinationno and there's there's a lot of thingsgoing on there as well because but howdo you get the money you're not going tohave it right so you have to go intodebt personally to get the student loansand then you by the time you hit the jobmarketprobably not at the the level you wereeven expecting to hit it at after thatfour years of you know working yourprobably partying your balls off uh toum to get through to college uh you yougenerally feel that by the time you walkaway from thatyou areentitled to somehalf decent paying jobvery very rarely ever happens so youcome out of that with that kind ofpsychological baggage like you know wellwhat the hell just happened there andhow am i 200 000 in debtormaybe mom and dad have paid for itand then that just causes a huge strainon the relationship within the familythere's there's a lot of ummessed up uh relationships where peoplethey've gone to university on mum ordad's dimeand then there's depressionlike the it's real uh especially ifpeople have that kind of tiger mumhanging over them uh you know you've gotto be a lawyer you've got to be a doctorwhatever it isand some people are justcoming away it's so messed up so messedup and then when they get out of collegethey realize well that four yearsi just ground that out this is not whati want to do at alllike not at all do i want to go andfollow this path but that's the phd i'vegot that's the degree i've got so nowthey feel handcuffed and you know kindof painted themselves into a corner thatthey've got to keep following that paththey've got to go and get that in airquotes high-paying jobto start paying off the loan or to atleastkind of validate mom and dad spendingthat money for you in the first place togoit's really damagingand if people have just been given thefreedom of choice to begin with andthey've been able to follow theirpassionsand kind of justfollow their natural bent there's athere's a quote by plato i'll have tofind it umsomething along the lines of[Music]learning under compulsionuh holds uhnothing over the mind or something likethat and uh you know it'sletting people findtheir their passions or their naturalbent i've completely butchered that i'llhave to find it perhaps you can put itin the show notesbut uh it's it's brilliant and that'splatolike you know this is this is not a newthingumbut we forget like school is a new thingschool is an experiment right we didn'thave school 200 years agoit didn't existit isit is not the normwe think it is but it isn't it never wasnever had beenup until the late 18th century but nowhere we are just blindlywalking the lineand sending our kids to school umwithout even thinking about it and youbrought something up earlier as wellabout you know dragging the kids up outof bed at like seven o'clock in themorningshoveling some cereal down their necksputting them onto a bus so they're goingto the school already exhaustedand malnourishedyeahand they get to school and what are theygoing to eat they're probably going toeat the packed lunch that you've packedwhich is a bread sandwich and some kindof chocolate bar and a packet of crispsand a juicy drinkor they're going to go to the schoolcanteen and thengoodness knows what they're going to beum what they're going to be given theremalnourishedexhausted they get homeand then like you said books out carryon with the male nourishmentand the exhaustionit'sa spiral a deaththere's no learning going on ahmarquita thank you the plato quoteknowledge which is acquired undercompulsion has no hold on the mindtherefore do not use compulsion but letearly education be a sort of amusementyou will then be better able to discoverthe child's natural bentnicewhen was plato around anyone know likeyou know this is[Music]yeah there's just there's so muchthere's so muchwrong with it that people aren'tquestioningyeah i think you know one thing about itis that it uh destroys a lot of people'ssense of discipline for life school doesthat there isi can see the point here for the whereyou could say well maybe plato can saysomething like this but most kids thesedaysneed to justshut up and learn their numbers you knowand there is definitely a point therelike there are some things thatsometimes maybeyou know it's it shouldn't all be it'sit's not just a consumer experience it'snot a sensory experienceyou know if you just let kids completelyhave theirwhat their curiosity directs themthey're going to want to learn abouteating ice cream every daythat's going to be what they want soobviouslyyou know the role of a parent or aneducator is tochanneltheir interests in a way that isproductive to try and direct them in away that is useful that can help themask the right questions so that they canget preoccupied in the right things andnot just choose to you know i'm going toeat ice cream all day every day and thatwill be my learningexperience but i thinkthe issue with schooling is thatwhen it's done according to this brutalschedule and this top down directionthen it it doesn't quite teach childrendiscipline in the healthy way teacheschildrendiscipline out of fear it teacheschildren the idea that you do the thingsthat you are supposed to do becauseotherwise you get into trouble and youknow maybe you get chained or you getsuspended fromschool or you get low grades and thenyour parents get angry and there are allthese terrible consequences to notperforming the job in schooland i think for a lot of people you knowwhat screws up their 20sis the fact thatin in their mind as i got out ofuniversity i got out of school i nolonger have to bei no longer have to do what i'm toldand then that takes away the entireconcept of discipline the entire conceptof self-control and so you'll doeverything that you want whenever youwant then you become a child all overagain and i thinkit's it's very commonbecause it teaches kids thatdiscipline and productive work issomething that can only be uhcoaxed out of you orthat you have to be coerced into andthen once you snap out of that thenumonce you're out of the once you're notin a position where somebody can uminfluence you and coax you into actionor threaten you or or cajole you intoactionthen you don't have to do anything soyou just spend all of your dayum being uh just following your basisdesires eating and partying andbut of course i think you knowwhen you do experience that in your 20seventually it catches up to you in oneway or the other you realize you know ifyou don't turn up to work you lose yourjob you lose your money and then youstart building the healthy sense ofdiscipline of understandingdiscipline as freedom understandingdiscipline as just protectingyourself from the negative consequencesof what will inevitably happen if you'renot disciplined and that's the healthyuh approach which i thinkthis is what childhood should be about ithink this is what education should beabout you know if there's anything thatchildren shouldn't do isdevelop thisconception ofdiscipline teach them to develop thisidea of wanting to do the right thingandobviously it's not easy but i think theschool isn't really helping the schoolis uh getting in the way and then thatthey only learn it most of us i thinkonly really learn this stuff in our 20syeah what's going on is obedience rightuh that's that's what's um they're notteaching discipline that's eatingobedienceand peter gray i mean he was braveenough to to come out and uhhe wrote the book free to learnumand actually when he was on my podcasti i calli have a little joke running joke withmy oldest daughter that uh chooses to goto school i call it the local ghoul eggi'm like you knowwhy on earth why on earth do you want togo to that that gulagand it was peter gray that uh thatbrought this up that schools you cancompare a school directly to a prisonuh and in facthe got a lot of for that as you can imagine thatjust triggers a lot of peoplebut then when you think about it and helogically explains it um anybody can goback and listen to that interview withhim uh you know he talks about well youknow if you think about it he's you knowyou you take the kid to school you leavethem at the gate that gate gets lockedat a certain point no parents areallowed on to the the school grounds nochild is allowed to leaveand they are under constant supervisionall day longuh they are only given x amount of freetime to go and playum thethe food is definitely comparable uh andin fact i think uh people who've donestudies on this found that there's morefree time given to inmates than thereare to um to kids in schooland it'swhen when you start thinking about itthat way you're like holythere's that that's so trueandit'sit comes back to the socialization thingagainwhen uh when people talk about you knowschool has to beyou have to send your kids to to schoolso they can socialize you knowit's it's an anti-socialarenabecause like we said you put in to thatclassroom you have no choice you have tosit down and shut up the only chanceyou're going to get to make some kind ofconnection or make some kind of friendsis in that break time 15 minutes 30minutes 45 minutes or an hour maybe atlunch whatever it isbut you generally spend most of thattimeavoiding the people you already know youwant nothing to do withrather than hanging out with the peopleand you would notevergo and talk to the people younger thanyouand you wouldn't ever because that youknow they're below your station youwon't ever go and speak to the peoplehigher than you so you get nichedstamped and packaged within your firsttwo weeks of that schooling um careerand that's you man you're done that isyour nation subset for the whole timethere's nothing social about that andit's just yeah and i think you know at avery basic level we studied this in oureconomics course on safety dean.com youknow society is made up of people whointeract with one another voluntarilyand it's uhcivilization is based on the idea thatwe don't have to know each other but werespect each other's property we respecteach other's bodies we don't take eachother's stuff we don't hurt each otherandwe cooperate when we both agree to it umand that's not what school is so youknow children are not autonomous inschool they'redragged aroundand told what to doin very specific almostmechanistic um terms you know you youstand in line at this time you go in youtake notes you remember this youmemorize that you answer this way youanswer that and it's just a constantexercise insubjugating your willand notum enacting your will not listening toyour will not listening to yourself notletting yourself act the way that youwant it's just a constant subjugationof your willand the thislearned helplessness of understandingthat whatever is going to happen now isgoing to happen because it's beenpredeterminedand your only way of fighting is to getinto trouble basically become a misfityou know either submit or become amisfit basically and become a failureand then get drugs and then have yourparents show up and thenbe treated like you're sick because youdon't want to go along so it's it's it'sa cruel exercise almost in uhdrumming the humanity out of childrenyeah completely um we should probablytalk uh you know about certificationbecause people ask me about yes some ofthe timeumdo you remember when you started yoursafety in.com and you were thinkingabout uh i think someone even asked youis there gonna be a certificate if itake this courseuh and i remember having an emailexchange with you about it and i'm likewell if people want a certificate youcan just download one from the internetand send it to them if you wantand you responded to me it decisionmade there's no way i'm doingcertificatesthat's trueit's true i mean i think i don't knowi'm i'm perhaps revisiting that i mustadmit but like my initialmy initial umin general when i want to do things i'mextremely laser focused in a way thatcan bea little uh funny and absurd and uhinappropriate at timesbutmy idea was i wanted to teach anaustrian economics class and soeverything else was it was details andwhen i just get um taken by the missionof doing something like getting thisclass done the focus is on the missionitself and it's very hard for me tothink of other things and so for me itwas preparing the material for thecourseand all the time that i could spend onpreparing the material is time that iwanted to spend on preparing morematerialandpreparing an exam justdid not strike me as beingintellectually interestingand i just umi iyeah i thinkuhit's uhit doesn't quite make sense to testpeople for many thingsum and i think austrian economics is noteasily conducive to thosekinds of questionsit'si i i thought of these courses beingperhaps more about the individual justlearning for their own sake rather thanfor certification and that's why ihaven't offered any certification butnowsailor.org have bought my course andthey made meaddquestions for it and i must admit it'shelped merethink uhexamination i think there is some valueto itumexamination particular for students totoyou know test their own knowledgebut i think also there's value perhapsin some kind of certificationumultimatelyi had a too much of a reaction againstthe idea of certification based onuniversities because universitiesturned us into something absurd but ithinkyou know brief online course with astandardized testis something that people might benefitfrom adding on to their cv if you canguarantee a specific way of uhof testing andyou know making sure that it can't beeasily hacked as sailor.org doso it can beit might be useful so maybe i've changedmy mind a little bit about thatsoexcuse me um yeah i get asked all thetime well how are your kids ever goingto be able to go to university if theydon't have any qualificationsthis is another myth that's been bustedabout 100 times if not more i'veactually interviewed people that runbusinesses where they helpkids put together in the us it's calleda uh a transcriptbasically a great big folder ofeverything that you've learnedthroughout like yourchildhoodevery book that you've readuh any languages that you've learned etcetc and what generally happens is homeschooled kids and homeschooledhomeschooling parents um[Music]they always play the system slightlydifferently so what they would do ismake appointments to go to the office ofthe administration's officer in theuniversities and actually turn upmake an appointment turn up the thechild and the parent with the transcriptsit down in front of the admissionsofficer go through everything thatthey've done all of their experiencesmaybe they've been world schoolingfamilies and they can just pull up theblog andwe did this we did this this is why wedon't have thetypical sat results and you knowwhatever else they get signed up on thedayone lady she had the admissions officerwalked them down to the photocopier tookuh took picturesandhad everythingphotocopied and signed and whatever elseto come and studytheat the college of their choiceand the subject of their choicenow the reason for that is as anadmissions officer you let that personwalk out youyou're trying to attract people to theuniversity and if you can attractslightly differentforward-thinking people that are gonnabring something else to the universitythen you're gonna take them on straightaway rather than that just stack of satsthat are just sitting there that you youtake a hundred at random and say okayyeah fine you can come you're inuh it'syou should watch actually if you've notalready the college admissions scandalon umon netflixthat gives you a real insight as to howbroken that system is uh in the us forfor people getting into and going tocollege and um theuh like how bad it is for students thatlose outbecause of the scandals that have beengoing on uh for people getting inthat shouldn't have got in at all butlike you say if you make a donation tothe right place or if you use that coachthat's going to get you in the side doorthen um yeah you're all good it'scompletely uh complete nonsenseum i was going to go off on anothertangent umcertificationuh soyeahis there a need for itnois there a want for it yes some peoplewant to have the certificates they liketo havesomething to show for the work thatthey've put inour daughters16 now and 13 this year sat a gcsevirtually set a gcse french exambecausethey can speak french they're fluent infrench and they want the certificate tosaythey want to get the a or the a starthey want thatuh so my wife and i you know we welooked around how can we make thishappenthere are companiesthere's even a remote school here in infrance but which we could use and wecould pay them i can't remember how muchit was it's not stupid and you sit theuh you sit the examyou're online with the uh the the tutorwho's over who who's overwatching it alland then you you send in the the answerswe're currently waiting for the resultsto come out in the next two weeksthere are a hundred different ways youcan make this happen again it comes backto you have a choiceexplore your options do your ownresearch and kind ofdesign the life that is best for you butyou're to come up againsta lot of pushbacka lot of pushback from the socialconstructbecause peopleman they don't mind telling you straightaway that you're a bad parent if you'reeven thinking about doing thisuh because it's justyou face this as a bitcoiner as well youknow you go against the financial legacysystem people are going to look at youlike you're you know a heretic or justsome crazy conspiracy theoristsame with homeschooling me same withhomeschooling alternative schooling ofany sortjust follow the rules just get thecertificates and life will be all rightyou'll get the 2.4 the kid the two carsthe white picket fence and everything'srosy well we all know that'stoosoif you have the choice which you dothenexercise ityeah well the choice is something thatwe might not get to exercise for verylong in many places it's becoming uhincreasinglythe limit of what we can choose is uhbecoming more and more convicted everysingle dayumso in terms ofumchoices so you you still don't reallyhave a very set answer about what tocoverthat's just let the child decide or isthere some kind of curriculum that youaim to cover soum are there some kind of milestones youknow they need to be able to read andwrite by this age they need to be ableto doaddition and subtractionmultiplication algebrahow does that workno there's no there's no set curriculumum they're all reading and writing uhthat that's that's another myth aboutschool you you don't learn to read atschooluh you just don't um you learn how to dothe alphabet and you learn how to youknow copy things off of a blackboard butreadingreading is always learnt in the homereadings learn with mom and dad readingstories together when kids are very verysmall and that love of learning and thatlove of readingshould just be given time to develop umif you think about uhyour homeyou knowyour home your kids are surrounded bybooks all the timeand they have the opportunity to go andpick them up and read them whenever theywant or read them with you or read themwith their older sister or older brotherthey have the opportunity all of thetime in schoolour kidsgot were only allowed to visit thelibrary once a weekand take out one bookthat they had to uh thenbring homewhich they never read because they chosethat book under compulsion and then takeit backit was just completely pointlessuh soumi've lost my train of thought becausei'm not answering the question againthat you're original curriculum so no wewe don't we don't have we don't have anykind of milestones set in place we we douhkind of insist that they're doing thethe math classes each weekand the uh the reading and um excuse methat the writing classes each weekuh with the um with the galileouhotherwisei'm already blown awayuh my second oldest daughter she we wereusing that sameumonline remote school in france here atthe moment she's learning gcse mathsbecause she wanted toso she's she's going through that ican't do those math problems she's doingalgebra and all of this crazy stuff it'sjust completely over my head but uh it'sfun to watch her kind of tackle thatumandwhether she sits that gcse early or notor does another year or two of studybecause she shouldn't even be study uhsitting gcses for another three yearsumbut again you know you can speed thisprocess upas you said the inefficiencies in thesystem are just so crazyum but yeah no to answer your originalquestion no that there's no setcurriculum as far as we're concernedso like how common is it for um childrento fall behind in these kind of settingswhere you know they're 12 and they stillcan't read or they still can't dosubtraction or in addition because youcan see the parents getcaught up in all kinds of things and notfollowing throughor what do you thinkvery rarethere are some cases uh peter gray did astudy of the sudbury valley school in uhin the uswhich uh ben prentice went to actuallymr cool bp from wtf happened in 1971 ohyeahhe is a crazy self-directed educated kidfrom the sudbury valley school uh in uhin massachusetts that schoolyou turn up if you want to turn up youlearn what you want to learn you joinwhat class you want to clap uh you youwant to joinuh and there was a story of a kid therethat umjust wanted to go fish in the pond everyday and uh that was all he didand they just let him do it umthey're they'reand god knows what he's come on to besome some genius of some sort i'm sureuh there are kids some kids don't learnto read until they're 11and then all of a sudden they pick thebook updonegot it done because they needed to andbecause they wanted to and then youcan't stop themhaving having these milestones andtesting kidsuh is is really dangerousuh it can really put a lot ofpsychological baggage on them make themfeel as though they arethickfor one of a better word umandunable to do it for for some reasonsomething wrong with their brain comesback to that againwhereas they're just not naturally readyfor it yetumyeah there'sso much worry out there about it there'sin the uk i know they test kids at likereadingstagesumyou're putting pressure on afive-year-old kidto be reading but at stagex y or z by the age of five by the ageof six and by the age of seven and ifyou're not able to read this book andcomprehend itthen you're behindyou're being told you're thick at theage of five it's likethat's notthat's not teaching or mentoringthat's sortingand it's very disruptiveyeahi mean i i i think i agree i think in umin particular with young kids as yousaid people can stress out too muchabout these early milestones butthey'll read when they need to read andif they're for have you met an adultthat can't readyeahyes there are yeahyeah yeah but have you met themyesyeahyeah there are people who can't read inthe world it has happenedthere are yes but i meanwhat's the percentagei mean i don't know literacy is uhgoing up all the time but there arepeople still can't readis that because they um they they didn'tget to go to school or they didn't theyweren't exposed to booksboth probablyi would say if they were exposed tobooks that would probably just solve theproblemyeah i think you pick up the skills youwant when you need to but yeah if you'renot exposed to books and if you're notexposed to the concept of needing tolearn to read thenyeah these these would be older peoplein general i think younger people willfigure out a way to read very quicklyvery easily these days100 especially if they're online matelike they are all of the timeuh you know playing umplaying things like minecraft or robloxwell you've got a little chat box openand you're playing with your cousinwho's in a different country or adifferent part of the countryand you're chatting to each other in thechat box whilst you're playingpeople think that they're just bummingout doing nothing they're learningthey're look there's a learningopportunity especially uh minecraftwhere you're building stuff yes you'rein a virtual world you might not be outin naturebutyou're in a virtual world you'rebuilding things you have freedom tolearn and you're reading and you'rewriting at the same timebut it just gets it it gets completelyno they're playing computer gameswe've got to stop thatyeahyeah that's uh that's interesting soyou're you would call yourself more ofan unschooler than a homeschooler huhself-directed education umto to home school you have to unschool iwould say because if like i said at thebeginning if you go into it with aschool mindsetand here's the thing here's a warning toparents like you got to get you got toget yourself readyumyou've got to unschool yourself first ofalland you've got to take a very stronglook at what the systemhas done to you in the past how it'saffected you andyour your adult life and your learningopportunities your your career pathbecauseall of itwill tie back tosome positiveor mostly in most caseshighly negative problems that uh thatyou faced in school and that that couldrange fromuhbeing being placed in in bottom sets orbeing bullied or not being able to takeexams because your grades aren't goodenoughor you know justbeing faced against a bad teacherbeing paired with[Music]awful classmatesthere's a lot thereand it'sit's deepand if you umyou you have toyou have to face that down and unschoolyourselfand believeplace place faith back in the process oflearningand trust that the child is learning allof the time all of the timeall of the time even if they're not in ain a lesson they're learningalwaysyou can't stop itunfortunately school triesbut you can't stop he cannot stop a kidlearning uh so if you can get in the waywhen you need toand give them exposure to the tools thatthey need when they're showing interestin something and it could be anything itcould be you know show an interest inlearning to play guitar get on ebay andbuy a guitar for thirty dollars you knowjust put it in their hands don't hire ateacher and send them off to lessonsjust get the damn tool and give it tothemand see if they are going to enjoy itand if it doesn't work out it was 30bucks resell it it doesn't matterbut if it does work out and they'reshowing more interest then go and getthe tutor then they join uma band or a group of other people thatare looking to uh to play and that'sreal socialization yeahright that's socialization football issocializationyou know my son plays for a local teamthat's where his friends arehe doesn't have friends out of a schoolhe has friends from his football clubbecause they love footballand they depend on each other whenthey're playing in the team and so theycreate this camaraderie with each otherand they socialize with each other theygo to each other's birthday parties usedtouh you know this umthat that socializationuh getting in the way as a parentwhen you need to to provide the toolsfor a kid that show an interest insomething is hugely importantyeah i think this is uh this is the uhthe first response i have for thesocialization question iswell you know that's not preparing forsociety society is a place where peopledeal with each other voluntarilyand i think the follow-up isjust because the kid doesn't go toschool doesn't mean they're not going tosocialize they're going to socializein settings that are more similar towhat they do in life in other words theyget to that they decide willingly andvoluntarily to joinsome kind of uh organization and settingwhere they want to be part so it couldbe we go onyou know we join a soccer team we goswimmingwe go sailing we go hiking in themountains you know you get together withlike-minded people who want to dosomething similar you go takephotographsor you know you learn chemistry you goto somebody's house to learn chemistryfrom them or you go and learnmath from somebody who's really smart atmath and who gives less australianeconomics or austrian economics yeahexactly how do you guys like theseweekly calls like seriously everybodyhere on this call we've been turning upfor god knows how long like it's like atherapy session each week it's brilliantbut like you and i would not have met ifyou didn't set that upand i turned it straight because iwanted to learn and you showed upbecause you wanted to teachand so did all the other guys so nowwe've got likehow many now safe like 20 30 40 peopleyou know on any weekuh that are showing up and socializingwe socializeyou know not all of these calls arerecorded right sometimes we're justhanging out and bullshitting uh thisthis is huge this you formed a socialgroup and we come we socialize and welearn at the same time without evenrealizing we're learning sometimesyeah and it's because it's voluntary andthat's why it's everybody behaves in acivilized way because everybody realizeseverybody else hasa choice about whether they want to behere or not and so if youbehave in a way that is anti-socialyou alienate others they either kick youout or they stop coming in and so thenthe whole thing is gone so people have avery different mentality you know it'sinteresting that the kids willbully each other and will get bullied inschoolbut then youmove them to another setting where theyinteract with each other in uhlike in say university or in placeswhere they're uh or at work and thatdynamic disappears because they'redealing with each other in a voluntarysettingand this kind ofsomebody who's there who's stuckandthis kind of antagonistichostility towards one another disappearswhen you take them out of that settingyeah completely and uh yeah did you seewhat lindley said in the uhif we are socializing here does thatmake us socialist[Laughter]uh yeah umthere'si don't know man umis there anything leftuh did did we take everything off uhi've got a few uma few uh tools if people want to use itumactually there's another quote from sirken robinson if youyou can't ask an eight-year-old child tosit down and do low-grade clerical workfor eight hours a day and not expectthem to get boredand it's justperfectfive days a weekyeah you knowlike that's crazy but there are sometools that the listeners can check outuh if they want to do their own
