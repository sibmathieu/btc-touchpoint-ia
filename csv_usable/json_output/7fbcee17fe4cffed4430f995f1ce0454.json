Hit the blue + in the bottom right hand corner of the home screen and hit receive.  You will then be given a screen like this. Scan the QR code or copy the address and paste into whatever wallet you are sending from.\n\n\n\nThe transaction should appear in SW almost straight away and you will then need to wait for the transaction to confirm on chain. Obviously how long this takes depends on the mempool and the fees paid.\n\n\n\nOnce the transaction has confirmed hit the blue + which will open up a small menu as shown here. Then hit Whirlpool.\n\n\n\nYou will then be greeted with this loading screen.\n\n\n\nOnce loaded, you will be greeted with your Whirlpool home screen which looks like this. Next up, hit the Whirlpool icon in the bottom right.\n\n\n\nNext, hit mix UTXOâ€™s\n\n\n\nYou will then be presented with a list of your UTXOs ready for mixing.  With mobile you can select any number of these depending on the pool you wish to enter.\n\n0.01 (1m sats)\n0.05 (5m sats)\n0.5 (50m sats)\n\nYou need slightly more than the pool size to pay miner and mix fees.\n\n\n\nOnce you have selected your UTXOâ€™s you will see this screen to select the pool you wish to enter and select your cycle priority. The cycle priority will adjust you miner fees up or down depending how desperate you are to mix those sats.\nOnce you have made your selections your miner and total fees will be displayed. When you are happy, hit review cycle details.\n\n\n\nYou can now review the final details before you begin the mix. Once you are happy with how well smelted your sats are about to be you can press begin cycle.\n\n\n\nYou should now see a warning about Doxxic Change. The wallet is basically asking you if you want to mark the change from this mix (which can be linked to your previous transactions) as â€˜do not spend.â€™ It is always a good idea to hit yes but your change is always under your full control regardless which option you choose. It is just a measure to prevent you linking your mixed funds with your unmixed funds in the future and undoing all of your hard work sat smelting.\n\n\n\nYour UTXOs are now being prepared for a mix in the desired pool. The state of the mempool + fees paid at the time of mixing will dictate how long you see your UTXO queued for. You can check the status by pressing on the UTXO.\n\n\n\nOnce the on chain transaction has confirmed you should be entered into a mix straight away and see something like this.\n\n\n\nOnce the mix has completed you will see the UTXOâ€™s in your Whirlpool post mix.\nFully mixed and ready to spend, safe in the knowledge that these UTXOâ€™s have 0 deterministic links to their past.\n\n\n\n\nSome side notesâ€¦\n\nAlways wait for the blue loading bar to stop moving before you take any action.\nTo access your doxxic change click the three dots on the home page and press â€˜Show Unspent Outputsâ€™.\nTo increase your privacy look into running your own Dojo so that you do not rely on Samouraiâ€™s servers. myNode or RoninDojo are the easiest examples.\nYou only pay the pool fee once, remixing is free thereafter but SW needs to be open for this to occur.\nIf multiple remixing is what youâ€™re after look into the desktop GUI+CLI implementations.\n\n\nAnd thatâ€™s it folks, coinjoining could not be easier now mobile is here! Shout out to the Samourai team for creating such an easy user experience and bringing fungible bitcoin to the masses.\nIf you get stuck feel free to DM me or hop into the Whirpool Telegram chat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail me\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTelegram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGitHub\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNostr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n      \n        QnA\n         • \n      \n      2023\n\n      \n         • \n        \nBitcoiner.Guide\n\n\n\nGet involved ðŸ§¡\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
