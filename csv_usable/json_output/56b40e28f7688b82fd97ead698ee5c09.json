  "text": "Preston Pysh (00:03):\nHey, everyone. Welcome to this  Wednesday’s release of the podcast, where we’re \ntalking about Bitcoin. Today’s guest is a friend  that has created quite the online impression for \nhis depth of knowledge and written contributions  to the Bitcoin community. Like some of the other \nguests we’ve had on the show, he wishes to remain  anonymous, but online he goes by the handle, \nCroesus. During the show, we talk about his  thoughts on why Bitcoin is difficult for so many \npeople to understand and agree with. We cover his  thoughts on the Bitcoin adoption curve compared to \nother technologies, various models to understand  its value proposition and much, much more. So, \nwith that, here’s my interview with Croesus.Preston Pysh (00:58):\nMan, am I excited to have this. I  really enjoy following your feed on Twitter and \njust the articles you write are so thoughtful,  so well-organized. I think that’s the thing I \nlike is the organization and the structure of  your writing style and just how you piece \nthings together. So, welcome to the show.Croesus (01:19):\nThank you. It’s great  to be here. That’s really kind \nof you to say about my writing.Preston Pysh (01:22):\nNo, I’m serious. I share anything  that I see of yours, see how you’re piecing things \ntogether. So, hey, let’s start this off. You wrote  an article that was near and dear to me because \n… You know which one I’m talking about. So,  I just kept talking with close friends, family \nmembers, and having been in the space for a while  and having friends that work on Wall \nStreet that were really close to  just finance in general just looked at it \nfor years as just being a speculative mania  that has no backing, no nothing, and \nit was almost like there was a curse.Preston Pysh (02:00):\nThis is, obviously, me who was a Bitcoiner. It  felt and seemed like there was a curse for if you \nwork in traditional finance on Wall Street, it was  like you weren’t allowed to understand it or that \nit was a senseless thing to talk about, especially  in any type of public kind of way. No one took \nit serious, but they all wanted to talk about it.Preston Pysh (02:21):\nSo, you write this article, and the article was  called, and we’re obviously going to have a link \nto this in the show notes, and the name of the  article is Why The Yuppie Elite Dismiss Bitcoin. \nWhat was the impetus for you to write this?Croesus (02:36): Yeah. So, I don’t know if you \nhad the same experience, but  it was cultural phenomenon in the early pandemic \nphase where everybody was doing Zoom happy hours.  I had a Zoom happy hour with my friend group from \nbusiness school Thursday nights every week. I was  deep down the rabbit hole, and excited to try \nto nudge the conversation towards Bitcoin and  why they all needed to take it seriously \nand look into it and get a couple of coins.Preston Pysh (03:05):\nWhat’s the price at this point? Sub 10,000?Croesus (03:08):\nYeah, 6,000, something like that.  Invariably with that group, it was always \ndismissed. Any attempts to try to bring  up the topic or take it seriously was \ndismissed with borderline hostility.  It was insulting to them that I would use \nthe group’s time to talk about something as  ridiculous as Bitcoin. So, that \nfestered for a couple of months there.Croesus (03:36):\nThen I had a conversation  with Dan that I write about in the article, where \nI had a frustrating moment of just asking him,  “What do you think the chances are of this \nthing going to a million dollars per Bitcoin?”Croesus (03:50):\nHe said, “0.001%.”Croesus (03:53): I said, “Well, after thousands of hours of \nlooking into this, I think it’s more like 80%.”Croesus (03:57):\nHe said that it sounds like  it’s a self-serving belief, and that pissed me \noff. I went to my computer and I started banging  out this article right on the spot. The framework \nthat this had been stewing for a while that I was  trying to build on this idea that had gone around \nin the Bitcoin community of a meme, really, of the  bell curve of IQ and the far right the super smart \nfolks think Bitcoin is going to 250K, and on the  left think it’s going to 250K. The folks in the \nmiddle, the “midwits” think that it’s impossible.Croesus (04:36):\nThat was the framework that people pointed towards  is, “Oh, great. We’re getting resistance from \nthe middle or whatever,” but here I was dealing  with my super smart MBA friends who were more \ndismissive than any of my other friend groups.Preston Pysh (04:53):\nThey weren’t having it at all.Croesus (04:55):\nYeah. They weren’t having it at all.  Whereas my other friend groups had taken \ninterest, had been open to the possibility that  this asset, it sounds out there, might have \nsome merit, and might be worth having some of.Preston Pysh (05:09):\nSo, these are the people  that didn’t go to the Ivy League MBA program.Croesus (05:12):\nThat’s right.Preston Pysh (05:14):\nOkay. Got it.Croesus (05:14):\nYeah. So, I write about in the  article I have a friend who’s a sailboat captain \nfor a living, and I told him, “You should probably  look into Bitcoin,” and he bought some that night, \nand he’s been stacking since. He’s a Bitcoiner,  and he listens to podcasts and has gone \ndown the rabbit hole because, I think,  a big part of that is that he didn’t already \nhave a worldview about finance and investing.  So, being taught or being introduced to this \npossibility that there’s something new and  exciting didn’t break his worldview. It was \nconstructive rather than destructive to the  existing worldview that my MBA friends have \ninvested so much of their time and energy to  build based on what they learned in school \nand what they learned in their careers,  and all the hours they’ve put in grinding for \ncompanies in finance or bosses that have a strict  worldview based on what they’ve learned over their \n30-year career during this 40-year bull market.  The worldview that they’ve been steeped in \nand have bought in to is at odds with Bitcoin.Croesus (06:26):\nThe fundamental thread that I  came focused on in that article is that for my \nMBA friends, they have high trust in the system.  They have bought into the system. They \nhave given themselves to the traditional  understanding of finance and what money is and \nhow it works, and they’re super smart. That puts  them in this corner on a 2×2 matrix of smart \nand trusting of the system that is across from  where I find the Bitcoiners reside on that 2×2, \nwhich is smart, but distrusting of the system.Croesus (07:04):\nSo, they’re in these top two corners  of this 2×2 matrix, and they’re not seeing the \nworld the same way, and that this chasm that you  experience when you try to talk to someone \nwith an MBA or someone who works in finance  about Bitcoin. Bitcoin, by \ndefinition, is at odds with  the system they’ve invested their whole \nlives in to, and it’s a nonstarter for them.Preston Pysh (07:30):\nSo, before reading your article, I would toy with  this question so much. How can this person, this \nperson is so smart I can explain this to them in  excruciating detail, and at the end of it, they’re \njust like, “Yeah, I just don’t see that happening.  I understand everything you said. I just don’t see \nit happening.” When I think about that person and  I think about that simple matrix of their trust \nin the existing system, it nails it every single  time. I absolutely love to read. We’re obviously \ngoing to have a link to it in the show notes so  people can read and develop their own opinion on \nwhat’s happening, but, yeah, any other highlights  on that article or things that you would \nmaybe adjust or add to it since writing it?Croesus (08:09):\nI feel like I  was in the right zone, in the \nright place to write that article.  I’ve been surprised at how much it resonated with \nother people, people with similar backgrounds.Preston Pysh (08:23):\nWhat has any of them come around since then?Croesus (08:27):\nGood question. So, begrudgingly, half  I’d say of my MBA friends, my close friend group \nfrom business school, have a Bitcoin position  and I’d say, yeah, they’re, for the most part, \nwholecoiners. Just barely got them to that point.Preston Pysh (08:47):\nWhat drove it? Is it  because they’re seeing the squares and the Teslas?Croesus (08:51):\nYeah. Square was a big one,  and the expected competitive response from Venmo I \nthink motivated them to try to get some per year.Preston Pysh (09:01):\nNow, PayPal, yeah.Croesus (09:03):\nYeah, but NYDIG was a big one for them, too,  because the extent to which that it makes it \na serious asset class and calls attention to  the fact that here you have this company that’s \nfacilitating institutions and insurance companies  and pension funds to take positions in Bitcoin. \nThat’s what they do. That’s their business model,  and they’re getting engagement from the top-tier \ninsurance companies like the CEO of New York Life.  For the first time in that company’s 150-plus-year \nhistory, the sitting C of that company has joined  an external board, and that is the board of NYDIG. \nThat doesn’t happen, and that means something.  Then now in the last week, we have Ray Dalio’s \nCFO leaving to join NYDIG, a Bitcoin company.Croesus (09:55):\nThe people who have done their due diligence  on Wall Street, the people who have got around \nto that have taken positions, and that arrow  goes in one direction. The more you learn about \nBitcoin, the more you add to your allocation.  I think that my business school friends see \nenough of that happening that they’re like,  “I should probably have a hedge,” and I think \nthat’s where their heads are at right now.Preston Pysh (10:17):\nYeah. A lot of the NYDIG stuff is crazy. There was  something that I was reading where they were \nprojecting that 300 banks were going to have  or enable access for their clients to start buying \nBitcoin by the end of this year was the estimate.Croesus (10:33):\nSo, I don’t know if you remember last  summer the OCC came out with a guidance letter \nto banks saying that they were allowed to have  cryptocurrency custody products. That, to me, was \nthis signal that banks are actively petitioning to  this regulatory body that they want in on this, \nand they want to be able to offer a Bitcoin  savings account next to your dollar savings \naccount and collect all the fees that they can  collect on that for retail consumers. So, that was \nnine months ago that that guidance came out. Now,  the next step of that appears to be happening. \nIt’s rolling out to retail banking customers.Preston Pysh (11:21):\nI want to talk about  another article that you published, and \nthis was called Am I Too Late for Bitcoin?  There are tons of people that are \nout there that are looking at Bitcoin  that don’t know anything about finance in general, \nand they’re looking at it and saying, “Well,  I clearly can’t buy that,” and they’re saying, \n“I missed that boat, but Dogecoin is 30 cents.  So, I should probably buy a little bit \nof Doge.” Talk to us about your article,  and then frame this up for that person \nwho’s saying that to themselves right now.Croesus (11:55):\nSo, I spent my 20s as a  management consultant, and what I was trained to \ndo on approaching problems is to kick the tires,  look at it from different angles, and \nrun some numbers for yourself to size  things. So, that was my instinct when I went down \nthe Bitcoin rabbit hole, and one of the exercises  I went through was trying to figure out where \nwe were in terms of the tech adoption curve.Croesus (12:24):\nSo, if I believe that Bitcoin is the best savings  vehicle in the history of the world because of \nits monetary properties, which we can get into  and we should get into, but if it is the best \nsavings technology, the best vehicle for savings  out there today, then it’s a tech-enabled \ndisruption of how savings is done,  then you’d expect it to follow \nthe classic tech adoption curve  that we see with the internet or with television \nwhen it first came out or with social media,  any new product in that S curve that starts \noff slow and then speeds up once you hit  the middle of the bell curve of technology \nadopters, and then tails off at a plateau.Croesus (13:11):\nSo, in that S curve, where are we?  To figure that out, you have to take sock of \nwhat’s the total number of people who will  eventually adopt this technology, and to do \nthat, if it is the best savings technology,  then anybody who has wealth to save is your target \nmarket. There are 2.2 billion people in the world  with $10,000 or more of net worth. So, those \nare the people that Bitcoin is targeting.Croesus (13:40):\nThen at the same time,  we can also look at on-chain data to see \nhow many addresses have a meaningful amount  of Bitcoin in them. This is a thing \nthat people get caught up on, where  it’s hard to draw a line about what \nconstitutes meaningful adoption of Bitcoin.  I’ve heard numbers like there are 180 million \npeople who have some amount of cryptocurrency,  but that includes everybody, any tiny \nfractional amount that somebody forgot about  play theme money that $5 here and Dogecoin. \nI wouldn’t call that meaningful at option.Croesus (14:17):\nToday,  Newsweek said there are 46 million Americans \nwith … I forget if it’s Bitcoin or crypto,  but it’s a big number. I think it’s not \nrepresentative of the meaningful option. I  think that constitutes Americans that have \nthrown 20 bucks at Bitcoin in Robin Hood.Preston Pysh (14:36):\n10 bucks, yeah.Croesus (14:36):\nThey haven’t adopted it  as an actual savings vehicle. So, what would \nbe a reasonable threshold for a meaningful  amount of savings in Bitcoin? I just \ncalled it 0.1 Bitcoin, which is now $5,000.  So, that’s a meaningful amount of savings. \nAnything more than that is certainly meaningful.  You can see on-chain there are three million \naddresses with 0.1 Bitcoin in them. Of course,  it’s not quite apples to apples because a person \ncan have multiple addresses above that threshold,  but the bigger issue is that a lot of people \njust leave their Bitcoin on exchanges.Croesus (15:14):\nSo, how many people are leaving  a meaningful amount of Bitcoin on exchanges and \nnot taking self-custody? Probably a lot. Let’s  round that three million up to 10 million. So, if \nwe have 10 million meaningful adopters of Bitcoin  and there’s 2.2 billion that will eventually \nadopt this savings technology, that puts us at  half a percent penetration, half a percent into \nthe technology S curve. That’s really early.Croesus (15:42):\nThe innovators stage in the classic bell curve,  you got your innovators, your early adopters and \nyour mainstream. The innovators is the first 2.5%,  I think, or 2%. The early stages of the \ninnovators stage still. It’s crazy, really.Preston Pysh (15:59):\nWe’re talking standard deviations.  What would that be in the bell curve? In your \narticle, you were saying that it was around 2.6  standard deviations on the left \nside of the bell curve. It’s crazy.Croesus (16:11):\nYeah. It’s crazy early. If you’re 2.6 standard  deviations from the mean in anything, you’re \ndoing great or you’re doing really poorly, one  of the other. Yeah. So, it’s crazy early still. \nThe other way to look at that is by assessing how  cheap it is to get one human’s worth of \nBitcoin still. The way to run those numbers  is Bitcoin is for the whole world, and there’s \nonly going to be 21 million of them ever. So,  eight billion in population. 21 million divided by \neight billion, you get I think it’s around 250,000  sats. So, 0.0025 Bitcoin. That is \ncurrently what you can buy for $150.Croesus (17:02):\nIf Bitcoin becomes  the preferred store value asset for the digital \nfuture, which we think it’s on track to become,  then one human’s worth of it can be secured \nby anybody for $150 today, which means it’s so  early that you could feasibly set up a dollar cost \naveraging plan for yourself to stack one human’s  worth of Bitcoin every month or even every week \nif you wanted to still. That’s how early it is.Preston Pysh (17:35):\nTalk to us about  the valuation process that you use. I really \nlike how you laid this out. In your article,  you go into a lot of the adoption process. You \nsay that there are two different ways to really  know where we’re at. The one was the adoption \nprocess, which you just described there,  and then you also get into this valuation \nprocess, and you go through all these  different stores of value and the total \naddressable market from a market cap size.Croesus (17:58):\nYeah. So, this was part  of the consultant’s approach to sizing this \nproblem. I went through and I tried to find  good solid numbers for all of the different store \nvalue buckets that exist in the world. Humans  have found a variety of assets that are in \ndiffering ways scarce and because of their  scarcity, they are good stores of value \nbecause they’re assets that other people desire  and there’s a limited amount of them, \nwhether that is real estate or equities.Croesus (18:38):\nThe tricky thing about  equities is that it is scarce. You can create \na new company and that company has new shares  and all that, but what is scarce \nis the ownership percentage  of a certain market, that portion \nof the economy. That’s scarce.Croesus (18:56):\nSo, owning equities is  scarce. Owning art is scarce. Collectibles, some \nof them have value and retain value over time.  All of those buckets add up to something \nlike $400 trillion and, of course,  the massive bucket of bonds, and there’s 200 \nplus trillion in bonds, and 20 trillion in  negative yielding bonds, which means that whoever \nis holding those bonds has no better idea or plan  of what else to hold, and that’s the only reason \nthey’re willing to take that hit, basically.Croesus (19:29):\nSo, ostensively, as people  learn about the properties of Bitcoin and how its \nincreasing scarcity over time causes its value to  increase over time, there will be an exodus, \na shift away from holding assets like  negative yielding bonds or even low yielding \nbonds, which is the rest of the 200 trillion,  and towards shifting from those assets and \ninto something that appreciates reliably,  predictably over time because of its \nmonetary properties that are built into it.Croesus (20:03):\nSo, I went through that exercise of  trying to assess what’s a reasonable \namount of this store value bucket that  Bitcoin with its superior store \nvalue properties could reasonably  capture. Summing those up, 30% here, 50% there, \n10% here, I got to a number of 200 trillion,  which would mean capturing about half of \nthe store value total market in the world.Croesus (20:32):\nThat isn’t even addressing the currency  value, which I think there’s $100 trillion in \ncurrency in the world and three-level currency,  and Bitcoin would capture a large \nportion, if not the bulk of that as well.Croesus (20:47):\nSo, yeah, you get to a $200 trillion  total full potential with Bitcoin in today’s \ndollars and, of course, those nominal values will  balloon as inflation drives money printing, \nand money printing then drives inflation,  and that comes out to $10 \nmillion per Bitcoin, which is-Preston Pysh (21:05):\nAs we now define power today.Croesus (21:07):\nYou’re right.  That number, I still feel uncomfortable \ntalking about that number.Preston Pysh (21:13):\nI think most people do.Croesus (21:15):\nYeah. It’s hard to  take that seriously because that sounds like \nwishful thinking. It sounds like the thing that  I am excited about is going to take over the world \nand that sounds a little delusional, but that’s  the result of kicking the tires on this thing \nfor thousands of hours and running the numbers.Preston Pysh (21:34):\nYou see Michael Saylor throwing  around the same numbers. That doesn’t make it \nright. I’m just saying that there are other  people that aren’t looking at maybe your math \nand they’re coming up with very similar figures.Croesus (21:46):\nTo be fair, a year ago when I was talking  to my MBA friends in our Zoom happy hour saying \nthat this thing is going to 100,000 next year-Preston Pysh (21:55):\nYou were nuts.Croesus (21:56):\n… that was laughable, right? Yeah.Preston Pysh (21:59):\nYeah, it’s wild.  Let’s cover this other idea that you have talked \nabout. You’re saying that the digital revolution  has two parts. You talk about information \nand value. Explain what you mean by this.Croesus (22:14):\nSo, I like to think about the really zoomed out  view of how Bitcoin fits into monetary \nhistory and what it means for human progress.  Part of that is to take stock of what we are \nliving through right now in human history.  It’s a very special and crazy time because \nwe are living through the digital revolution.  For the most part, we think of that as \nthe internet. That’s what comes to mind.Croesus (22:46):\nWhat is the internet?  The internet is the digitization of \ninformation and information exchange,  and so that meant we took the default of \nhow we exchange and access information  went from physical with libraries and \nmagazine subscriptions and newspapers  to digital with the internet, and that process has \nbeen going on for the last 20 plus years. We’re  far up the S curve on that process. We’re arguably \ncoming towards the plateau of that process.Croesus (23:24):\nThe world’s information has been digitized  for the most part at this point, but it hasn’t \nbeen possible to digitize value because,  on the internet, everything can be copied, and you \ncan’t do that with value because then it loses its  value, then it can be stolen. That’s what Bitcoin \nrepresents is this invention of digital scarcity,  the invention of a system that allows for  value to not be copied, be impossible \nto copy in the digital realm.Croesus (23:55):\nThat  is this parallel stream to the internet and \nTCP/IP and the protocols of the internet enabling  information exchange through that ecosystem. Now, \nwe have a new protocol, a new set of rules for  the secure storage and exchange of value in the \ndigital space. What we’re watching with Bitcoin  is this bootstrapping from nothingness into the \ndigital store of value of the world, digital  value protocol of the world, and that means \na second internet of sorts that this is the  internet of value to complement the \nexisting internet of information.Croesus (24:44):\nIn that S curve, we’re still at the very  beginning stages, right? So, I think that it’s \nsomething that we don’t talk enough about,  the zoomed out view of what is happening in the \nworld right now and what Bitcoin means in terms of  this grand sweeping reality of in our lifetimes \ngoing from physical value, which is what the world  has known for all of human history to digital \nvalue in the same way that the internet took  us from physical information to digital \ninformation over the course of a few decades.Preston Pysh (25:18):\nYou have a chart that is really cool that shows  the application layer that’s being built on top \nof the existing protocols of the internet today,  and then how that’s going to potentially look \nin the future and how this value layer is going  to work itself into the protocol stack. Can \nyou describe what’s going on there for folks  that might not be intimately familiar with how \nthe internet works and what this all means for  businesses, incentive structures moving \nforward? I have an interest in what that  might mean for social media. What \nare some of your thoughts on that?Croesus (25:54):\nYeah. So, how does the internet work? I’m not the  most technical person, but I have the high-level \ngrasp of this. There are a series of protocols  like TCP/IP, which is just rules for how servers \ncan exchange packets of information, and have that  be represented as meaningful through browsers and \nwhatever other portals. That’s how the internet is  constructed, but that base layer, that protocol \nlayer cannot be owned because it’s just code,  it’s just rules for how to exchange information. \nThere’s no ownership layer at the protocol layer,  but what you can own are the businesses that \nare built on top of those protocols, so Amazon,  Netflix, Facebook, these entities, these \nbusinesses that are fundamentally built on  top of those protocols and their whole business \nmodel is based on being internet businesses.Croesus (26:54):\nYou can own those individual pieces, those  parts of the internet economy, but you can’t own \nthe internet itself. So, the best you can do is  if you’re a VC, you can invest in the next wave of \na bunch of different promising internet companies  and hope that one of them becomes a big win and a \nbig part of the next generation of the internet.Croesus (27:16):\nSimilarly, if you’re investing in equities,  you can own an index like the Nasdaq. That can \nbe your portfolio on how you get exposure to  the overall internet, but in doing that, you’re \nowning small pieces of a bunch of the different  businesses built on top of the protocol. \nThat’s very different from how Bitcoin  is designed because, by definition, \nthis is a value protocol.  There’s a value layer that someone has to \nown. It’s required for this thing to work.Croesus (27:48):\nSo, this protocol, the Bitcoin network, which  is a set of rules for how the nodes and users on \nthe Bitcoin network can send and receive and store  their Bitcoin, and you can’t own that. You can’t \nown the network itself, but there’s a unit, a unit  of account, a transactional unit, the symbol of \nwho owns what on this network, which you can own.  In this case, that means that you can take an \nownership slice of the overall pie, the whole  internet of value simply by owning a piece of the \nunderlying unit that makes the whole thing run.Croesus (28:30):\nSo, what we’re starting  to see on top of this protocol are the \nbusinesses that are growing and popping up  and the ecosystem that’s developing, \nfor-profit businesses built on top of this  ecosystem, on top of this protocol. So, that \nincludes exchanges like Coinbase. That is  based on making a business out of getting a cut of \ntransactions happening on the Bitcoin network and  other networks, too. It also includes \ncompanies like Fold or Strike, which are  these new generation of consumer-facing, \nuser-empowering Bitcoin services  that are using the protocol underneath it to \ncreate some new product that has real value to  the consumer based on the advantages of Bitcoin as \ndigital value over traditional financial products.Preston Pysh (29:26):\nLet’s talk about this term that’s used  a lot in the community, which is the speculative \nattack on fiat currency. I think Pierre Rochard  was the first one or is it Michael Goldstein? \nOne of those two was using this. Pierre-Croesus (29:41):\nPierre wrote this in 2014.Preston Pysh (29:43):\nSo, you put quite a bit of meat on the bone  for this idea in an article, which \nwe’ll have in the show notes.  You get into the DNA of an asset. \nTalk to us about what that is  and then talk to us about what this speculative \nattack really represents as far as your concern.Croesus (30:01):\nYeah. So, I guess what I’m trying to do on Twitter  is to put out educational content that simplifies \nwhat I’ve come to understand or believe about  Bitcoin and convey that educational message, \nand because of my background as a consultant,  as an MBA and someone who took a lot of \naccounting classes, I have this view about how  different assets perform over time, and that \nis that the best thing you can do historically  over recent history for your net worth is to \ninvest in assets like stocks and real estate  because they appreciate over time because they’re \ngenerating some kind of return, and they’re either  growing or they’re, in the case of stocks, \nthey’re growing or they might be generating  dividends. Similar dynamics with property you \nown and appreciate some value, can generate rent.Croesus (30:59):\nSo, that’s an exponential curve up into the right  if you have an asset that performs. So, in a \nlogarithmic scale, that means a straight line  up into the right. That’s the nature of those \ninvestible assets like stocks and real estate.  Their DNA is such that they appreciate \nover time if you invest in good ones.Croesus (31:24):\nOn the flip side, on the downside, there are  other things you can do with your money. You can \nconsume it. You can buy clothing and whatever and  immediately the value of that clothing after \nyou buy it drops dramatically to nothingness.  You could invest in a car, which is not an \ninvestment at all. It’s a form of consumption  because you’re purchasing a depreciating \nasset. The way that assets depreciate is  an exponential curve down into the right. \nIf you put that on a logarithmic scale,  that means a straight line down into the right.Croesus (32:00):\nSo, we have this landscape  of different assets, and they perform differently \nover time based on their DNA, what the asset is.  To add to this picture, you have to also include \ndollars, fiat currency. It is by design that the  root idea of the dollar system is that we’re going \nto print 2% more of it on average every year,  and that means it’s an exponential decay of \nfunction, and so that means that it may not  depreciate as fast as a car or lose its purchasing \npower as fast as storing value in a car,  but it does on a logarithmic. It is \na straight line down into the right.Croesus (32:46):\nThen contrasting with that is this  new kind of currency, this new digital currency of \nBitcoin whose design is increasing the scarcity.  To me, that’s the root of what Bitcoin is \nor why it’s an attractive asset to hold  is because of the halvings, because of the \nsupply issuance schedule. They’re making  less of it. It’s the only asset in the world \nthey’re making less and less of over time,  which means that if you hold some today, you are \nbuying in at a time when they’re making more of it  than they will be making of it four years from \nnow because of that supply issuance schedule.Croesus (33:26):\nSo, that increasing scarcity over time,  because of the supply-demand balance of today, \nthere’s 900 Bitcoin being mined every day,  and that’s going out into the market \nto meet net inflowing demand, and  we’re in the process of finding some \nnew equilibrium based on that amount  of supply issuance per day because a \nyear ago, just over a year ago, it was  1,800 Bitcoin per day, and that got cut in half. \nSo, now, we’re in this price discovery mode of  trying to find the right equilibrium for this new \nera of Bitcoin, and then three years from now,  that will be cut in half again and we’ll be \nproducing 450 Bitcoin per day, and that increasing  scarcity means that there won’t be enough supply \nto meet the demand at the equilibrium point we  established during this current reward era, \nwhich means the price will have to drift upwards.Preston Pysh (34:29):\nI got a question on that  because there was a question that came from \nTwitter from Eddie, and he’s curious whether  we’re going to start to see these halvings priced \nin to the current price. So, I think at this point  there’s been much debate leading up to the halving \nevents. People have made the case of why it can’t  be priced and why it is already priced, but having \nseen this multiple times now, I think it’s become  fool me once, all right, shame on you, fool me \ntwice, fool me the third time. Are we going to get  a chance for Wall Street to sit on the sidelines \nand we go through a whole another four-year cycle  waiting for the halving to happen or are we going \nto start to see that get priced into the curve?Croesus (35:22):\nThat’s a great question. I don’t really know.Preston Pysh (35:25):\nIf you had to place a bet,  one way or the other, what would you say?Croesus (35:28):\nMy bet is that Wall  Street is in disbelief and can’t comprehend \nthe implications of the imminent halving.Preston Pysh (35:38):\nLet’s say it goes to 200,000  in this year we’re at right now, in 2021. \nLet’s say by the end of the year this thing  goes to 200,000 or even higher. What does Wall \nStreet do at that point as they’re looking at  this thing and saying, “My God! This is \ngoing to happen again in a few years”?Croesus (35:58):\nSo, I think that like the stock-to-flow model  has it pegged to go to a million dollars \nin the next cycle and that’s going to give  everybody in traditional finance, \nthey’re going to bulk at that,  I think. You talking about a total valuation twice \nthat of gold in 15 years of Bitcoin’s existence.Preston Pysh (36:21):\nAt the same time, they’re looking at  miners that keep coming online and they’re looking \nat something that has a difficulty adjustment  that is adjusting itself to ensure that some \nportion of those miners remain profitable.  Now that we’re getting their attention, nothing \ngets their attention like an imaginary coin  that’s over $100,000 in valuation, right? So, \nthey’re going to start digging in. They’re  going to start realizing that you can’t pull \nthe supply curve to the left. You can’t pull the  production from the future further to the left by \nquadrupling the number of miners. It can’t happen,  at least not in any type of meaningful timeframe, \nright? They can do it for a week, but that’s it.Preston Pysh (37:06):\nSo, they’re going to start to understand  what that means, especially when you compare it \nto what would that mean if gold, if we look at  the gold market and no matter how many people you \nbring to mine that gold, you’re not going to pull  more ounces out of the ground than a certain rate \nthat you’re currently in as far as an epoch goes.Preston Pysh (37:26):\nThen magically in four years, you’re just going  to find half as much gold in the earth’s crust. \nPeople can start to do that analysis and say,  “Whoa! Maybe this is a million dollars. \nMaybe I need to start front running that.”Preston Pysh (37:41):\nI don’t know. I just think that at this point  there’s so much that’s been written about this and \nyou’re getting so much attention, and I don’t mean  to push back on your point of view. I guess I’m \ntrying to challenge that point of view for you.Croesus (37:54):\nI think you have more  faith in the capacity of Wall Street to imagine \na changed world four years in the future or  even a year after a halving. I think that you’re \nright, though, that there will be some portion,  some larger slice of the finance community that \nfor the next halving says, “I’m going to get ahead  of this. I’m going to front run it. I’m going to \nbuy it in the six months, nine months before,”  and that should happen. There should be some \npricing in of the halving, but I think that  what we keep seeing is disbelief at how \nfast the status quo changes with Bitcoin.Croesus (38:37):\nPeople aren’t prepared  to accept it as what it is today, let alone \nwhat it is going to be four years from now  or if you’re right before the halving, a year \nfrom now. A larger portion of the world will  wrap their heads around that, but I think that as \nhumans we’re good at optimizing for conditions as  they are today, and as a collective organism, \nwe find equilibrium with how things are today,  and we struggle to project forward how things \nmight change. I think that’s particularly  true when the way in which something \nis going to change is outside of how  everything else changes, which is to say that \nit’s inelastic to our reaction to it. You can’t  increase Bitcoin mining, and that’s different \nfrom every other commodity in the world.Croesus (39:31):\nSo, I think Wall Street and humans,  generally, will continue to underestimate how \ndifferent Bitcoin is going to be four years from  now just because we have no basis for comparison. \nWe have no other examples of a pre-programmed  supply schedule that is completely indifferent \nto how much we would like to increase supply.Preston Pysh (39:57):\nYeah, and what I’m thinking about,  let’s say you buy into the stock-to-flow model. \nLet’s say that on this current epoch that we’re  in the price settles in at $100,000 or $200,000, \nand you’re looking at a price four years later  of a million. When you do a compound annual growth \nrate of what growth rate am I getting if I’m going  from 100,000 to a million over a four-year \nperiod of time, and where else on the market  can I find that kind of return? Nowhere, right? \nYou’re like, “Maybe I should keep holding this.  Maybe I shouldn’t realize my capital gains and \nplay the trading game here. Maybe I should just  do what intelligent investors do when \nthey know that they’ve got a winner.”Preston Pysh (40:41):\nIf for whatever reason  something fundamentally changes with the hash \nrate and miners and all that kind of stuff and  you’re seeing it fundamentally fall apart between \nthe cycles, well, sure, maybe you need to change.Croesus (40:52):\nYeah. This is actually how I  became a Bitcoin maximus was the stock-to-flow \nmodel came out in 2019 and before that,  I had been in Altcoiner. I started with Ethereum \nand was into that whole ecosystem, and then the  stock-to-flow model comes out in 2019, and it \nsounds so crazy, but it has this, I don’t know,  I suppose familiar analytical rigor around it \nthat is the signpost to me that the person who  made this is very smart, and I should pay \nattention to or at least kick the tires on this.Croesus (41:26):\nSo, I spent the next couple of months  trying to figure out why it couldn’t be true \nand ran my own numbers that basically said that  this is totally plausible if we follow the classic \ntech adoption S curve, and we are aware. We talked  about earlier at the very beginning of that \nS curve, demand is going to rapidly ramp up  for Bitcoin, and at the same time, we have \nhalf as much being produced every halving era.Croesus (41:58):\nWhen you smash those two datasets together,  that comes out to a 10x increase in adoption \nadjusted scarcity, if you want to call it that  every four years for the next \n20-25 years, which is crazy,  and that’s what the stock-to-flow model is \nsuggesting also is a 10x increase every halving.Croesus (42:21):\nIt’s hard to pin down exactly why  is it working. I think it’s somehow capturing our \nhuman nature of valuing scarcity and this osmotic  flow of value from that which is not \nscarce to that which is more scarce,  the constant relevel setting of \nthese different store value buckets.Croesus (42:50):\nI’m using this osmosis idea of if you have  two water containers that have an osmotic membrane \nbetween them and you add salt to one of them,  water is going to flow into the \none that has salt because that’s  osmotic pressure goes in that direction. It seems \nlike that’s what is built into us humans is an  appreciation for scarcity and a desire to own that \nwhich is scarce as a scoreboard in our culture.Croesus (43:23):\nActually, to zoom out all the way, this is  fundamental to our species that \nI think in, yeah, shelling out  Szabo includes this amazing little anecdote \nthat he doesn’t really expand upon, but shell  money goes back 75,000 years. There’s evidence \nof it in cave sites going back 75,000 years,  but that’s for Homo sapiens, our subspecies. \nHomo sapiens, Neanderthals, Neanderthalensis,  their cave sites don’t have \nany evidence of shell money.Croesus (44:00):\nWhat’s interesting about that is that  the population, can’t really paint any notable \ndifferences between Neanderthals and Homo sapiens  besides the tools that Homo sapiens \nwere using were slightly better  and this notable difference of there doesn’t \nappear to be money in the Neanderthal sites.Croesus (44:22):\nThe result of that is that the  population density of the human, the Homo sapiens, \nsapiens’ caves appears to be 10 times as great.  So, having this appreciation, this species \nlevel appreciation for scarcity, which makes  money possible and facilitates trade and allows \nyou to support a larger population density and  emergent civilization level behavior \nappears to be the difference that our  species, the advantage that our species had over \nother early human groups, which is to say that  appreciating scarcity is what makes us \nhuman, and valuing scarcity is what makes  us human. Therefore, it’s in our DNA to \ngravitate towards that which is scarce.Croesus (45:11):\nSo, if you put  Bitcoin in this long timeline of human history, \nit is this perfection of that which makes us human  that we are now witnessing this creation \nof something which is absolutely scarce  and slowly moving towards absolute scarcity, and \nthe whole world is slowly processing this reality  and the economic reality that this invention \nimposes upon the world cannot be escaped.Preston Pysh (45:44):\nWhen you look at Adam Smith’s main thesis, which  is the division of labor, and the ability that it \nallows humans to collaborate in a meaningful way,  where I perform a task that’s very skilled \nand the person next to me performs another  task that’s completely different than mine \nthat’s very skilled and we’re able to exchange  those units of work in a meaningful way, you \ncan see how if you can optimize that system  without there being blemishes or manipulation \nentering itself into the system and the protocol  that’s beings used to manage the labor \ndata is how I would like to describe it.Croesus (46:25):\nThe price signaling of labor.Preston Pysh (46:26):\nThe pricing, yes. You can just see how  vital it is. If I was going to be a real optimist \nhere, it’s pretty exciting to think about what the  implications of such a sound majoring system would \nbe on a global scale and what that might mean.Croesus (46:45):\nWhat a strange time  to live through. It’s hard to believe \nthat this is part of our own history.Preston Pysh (46:53):\nHappening in our lives. Yeah.  Happening in our lifetimes. I know. I think \nabout that often. I agree with you. I think  it’s humbling to think that we’re living through \nthis period at this transition. It’s crazy.Croesus (47:03):\nYeah. For all of human history, we’ve had physical  stores of value and this is the zero to one moment \nof going from analog to digital. It’s right now.Preston Pysh (47:18):\nTalk to us about you’re saying early on  you were really interested in \nEthereum and then you found  your way to Bitcoin. Talk to us about what \nwas the original thing that drove you there  or that enticed you to look into that, and then \ntalk about your transition over to Bitcoin.Croesus (47:35):\nI guess I characterize this in hindsight,  for me, there are two stages, two major stages \nto the rabbit hole, and I think everybody  is going down the rabbit hole and they’re at \ndifferent stages. The first stage is recognizing  that digital value has a place today and into the \nfuture. I think that that’s where Ethereum people  are. That’s where Altcoiners are is you recognize \nthat we live in a digital world, we live on the  internet. I grew up on the internet, and this \nmakes sense to me. Digital value, being able to  exchange value and store value in a digital format \nmakes sense. Of course, this is going to be thing.Croesus (48:20):\nThen the second stage of the rabbit  hole is realizing why Bitcoin has already won, \nand what it really deeply means, which is to say  that this is not about technology. It’s about \nmoney and where does Bitcoin fit in into the  landscape, the history of money, how does it \nimprove upon the prior iterations of money,  how does it improve upon gold, why is it better \nthan fiat, and importantly, why is it going to  win out over those things, understanding \nthat the network effects of money  and shelling point reality of money and \nthe significance of absolute scarcity.Croesus (49:04):\nSo, yeah. I started, I dipped  my head into the rabbit hole and I saw this party \ngoing on in Altcoins and thought, “This is great.  This is totally the thing,” and that’s because \nI was steeped and we all have been steeped in  this ethos of internet, how the internet worked, \nhow internet adoption, how internet businesses  and internet ecosystem developed, and that was \ndriven by innovation, new companies popping up  trying something new, move fast and break \nthings, the whole Silicon Valley ethos.Croesus (49:35):\nOur approach to investing in technology  has been shaped by the cumulative experience \nof how the internet developed, meaning that  we all take a venture capitalist approach to \ninvesting in tech stocks, investing in internet  companies because that was the best way to do \nit because you couldn’t own the protocol itself.Croesus (49:58):\nSo, when I arrived in crypto scene,  I looked around and thought, “All right. \nWhat’s innovation? Where are upstart protocols  challenging incumbents?” Ethereum was the first \none in 2016 that seemed like it was falling that  narrative, and then I got into other Altcoins. \nThen I got crushed in the bear market, 2018-2019,  and that, plus the stock-to-flow model forced me \nto dig deeper and realized. You only realize then  that, “Oh, wait. This rabbit hole, this first \nlayer of the rabbit hole isn’t the whole thing.  There’s actually little back corner where if you \ndig a little deeper you discover that there’s a  whole another chamber below, and it’s more \nglorious because it’s a very different vibe  in there. It’s not a party. It’s a beacon of \nhope and sunshine for the future of humanity.”Croesus (50:56):\nI think most people,  our worldview has been shaped by recent history \nand the learned wisdom of the internet revolution.  So, we think that innovation is what matters. \nThat’s why everybody is caught by Ethereum, and  I think that it fits our worldview, the status \nquo worldview better, the Ethereum narrative,  but the truth is is that Bitcoin is an \neconomic reality that will continue to  play out and overpower any narrative. The \nsooner you dig down below that first level  of the rabbit hole to understand why \nthis is true, the better off you are.Preston Pysh (51:39):\nCroesus, man,  this was fun. I really enjoyed chatting with you. \nKeep pumping out this awesome content for people  that were listening to this that maybe want to \ndigest this in a more graphic kind of way. He has  awesome graphics that go with the articles. \nI’ll have the show notes with all these  articles in there. Is there anything else \nthat you want to provide a handoff to?Croesus (52:01):\nA lot of stuff, a lot  of educational content that I try to put out. I’m \ntrying to do my part to communicate the value that  can be have from stacking sats and the benefit \nthat can create for people and their families. A  lot of that educational content is best seen \nwith your own eyes and the graphics convey the  message a little bit better. So, check out \nmy Twitter, I guess, which is @Croesus_btc.Preston Pysh (52:31):\nAll right. Hey, thanks for joining us.Croesus (52:33):\nThis is a great time.Preston Pysh (52:35):\nHey, so thanks for everybody  listening to this show.

Welcome to this  Wednesday’s release of the podcast, where we’re \ntalking about Bitcoin. Today’s guest is a friend  that has created quite the online impression for \nhis depth of knowledge and written contributions  to the Bitcoin community. Like some of the other \nguests we’ve had on the show, he wishes to remain  anonymous, but online he goes by the handle, \nCroesus. During the show, we talk about his  thoughts on why Bitcoin is difficult for so many \npeople to understand and agree with. We cover his  thoughts on the Bitcoin adoption curve compared to \nother technologies, various models to understand  its value proposition and much, much more. So, \nwith that, here’s my interview with Croesus.Preston Pysh (00:58):\nMan, am I excited to have this. I  really enjoy following your feed on Twitter and \njust the articles you write are so thoughtful,  so well-organized. I think that’s the thing I \nlike is the organization and the structure of  your writing style and just how you piece \nthings together. So, welcome to the show.Croesus (01:19):\nThank you. It’s great  to be here. That’s really kind \nof you to say about my writing.Preston Pysh (01:22):\nNo, I’m serious. I share anything  that I see of yours, see how you’re piecing things \ntogether. So, hey, let’s start this off. You wrote  an article that was near and dear to me because \n… You know which one I’m talking about. So,  I just kept talking with close friends, family \nmembers, and having been in the space for a while  and having friends that work on Wall \nStreet that were really close to  just finance in general just looked at it \nfor years as just being a speculative mania  that has no backing, no nothing, and \nit was almost like there was a curse.Preston Pysh (02:00):\nThis is, obviously, me who was a Bitcoiner. It  felt and seemed like there was a curse for if you \nwork in traditional finance on Wall Street, it was  like you weren’t allowed to understand it or that \nit was a senseless thing to talk about, especially  in any type of public kind of way. No one took \nit serious, but they all wanted to talk about it.Preston Pysh (02:21):\nSo, you write this article, and the article was  called, and we’re obviously going to have a link \nto this in the show notes, and the name of the  article is Why The Yuppie Elite Dismiss Bitcoin. \nWhat was the impetus for you to write this?Croesus (02:36): Yeah. So, I don’t know if you \nhad the same experience, but  it was cultural phenomenon in the early pandemic \nphase where everybody was doing Zoom happy hours.  I had a Zoom happy hour with my friend group from \nbusiness school Thursday nights every week. I was  deep down the rabbit hole, and excited to try \nto nudge the conversation towards Bitcoin and  why they all needed to take it seriously \nand look into it and get a couple of coins.Preston Pysh (03:05):\nWhat’s the price at this point? Sub 10,000?Croesus (03:08):\nYeah, 6,000, something like that.  Invariably with that group, it was always \ndismissed. Any attempts to try to bring  up the topic or take it seriously was \ndismissed with borderline hostility.  It was insulting to them that I would use \nthe group’s time to talk about something as  ridiculous as Bitcoin. So, that \nfestered for a couple of months there.Croesus (03:36):\nThen I had a conversation  with Dan that I write about in the article, where \nI had a frustrating moment of just asking him,  “What do you think the chances are of this \nthing going to a million dollars per Bitcoin?”Croesus (03:50):\nHe said, “0.001%.”Croesus (03:53): I said, “Well, after thousands of hours of \nlooking into this, I think it’s more like 80%.”Croesus (03:57):\nHe said that it sounds like  it’s a self-serving belief, and that pissed me \noff. I went to my computer and I started banging  out this article right on the spot. The framework \nthat this had been stewing for a while that I was  trying to build on this idea that had gone around \nin the Bitcoin community of a meme, really, of the  bell curve of IQ and the far right the super smart \nfolks think Bitcoin is going to 250K, and on the  left think it’s going to 250K. The folks in the \nmiddle, the “midwits” think that it’s impossible.Croesus (04:36):\nThat was the framework that people pointed towards  is, “Oh, great. We’re getting resistance from \nthe middle or whatever,” but here I was dealing  with my super smart MBA friends who were more \ndismissive than any of my other friend groups.Preston Pysh (04:53):\nThey weren’t having it at all.Croesus (04:55):\nYeah. They weren’t having it at all.  Whereas my other friend groups had taken \ninterest, had been open to the possibility that  this asset, it sounds out there, might have \nsome merit, and might be worth having some of.Preston Pysh (05:09):\nSo, these are the people  that didn’t go to the Ivy League MBA program.Croesus (05:12):\nThat’s right.Preston Pysh (05:14):\nOkay. Got it.Croesus (05:14):\nYeah. So, I write about in the  article I have a friend who’s a sailboat captain \nfor a living, and I told him, “You should probably  look into Bitcoin,” and he bought some that night, \nand he’s been stacking since. He’s a Bitcoiner,  and he listens to podcasts and has gone \ndown the rabbit hole because, I think,  a big part of that is that he didn’t already \nhave a worldview about finance and investing.  So, being taught or being introduced to this \npossibility that there’s something new and  exciting didn’t break his worldview. It was \nconstructive rather than destructive to the  existing worldview that my MBA friends have \ninvested so much of their time and energy to  build based on what they learned in school \nand what they learned in their careers,  and all the hours they’ve put in grinding for \ncompanies in finance or bosses that have a strict  worldview based on what they’ve learned over their \n30-year career during this 40-year bull market.  The worldview that they’ve been steeped in \nand have bought in to is at odds with Bitcoin.Croesus (06:26):\nThe fundamental thread that I  came focused on in that article is that for my \nMBA friends, they have high trust in the system.  They have bought into the system. They \nhave given themselves to the traditional  understanding of finance and what money is and \nhow it works, and they’re super smart. That puts  them in this corner on a 2×2 matrix of smart \nand trusting of the system that is across from  where I find the Bitcoiners reside on that 2×2, \nwhich is smart, but distrusting of the system.Croesus (07:04):\nSo, they’re in these top two corners  of this 2×2 matrix, and they’re not seeing the \nworld the same way, and that this chasm that you  experience when you try to talk to someone \nwith an MBA or someone who works in finance  about Bitcoin. Bitcoin, by \ndefinition, is at odds with  the system they’ve invested their whole \nlives in to, and it’s a nonstarter for them.Preston Pysh (07:30):\nSo, before reading your article, I would toy with  this question so much. How can this person, this \nperson is so smart I can explain this to them in  excruciating detail, and at the end of it, they’re \njust like, “Yeah, I just don’t see that happening.  I understand everything you said. I just don’t see \nit happening.” When I think about that person and  I think about that simple matrix of their trust \nin the existing system, it nails it every single  time. I absolutely love to read. We’re obviously \ngoing to have a link to it in the show notes so  people can read and develop their own opinion on \nwhat’s happening, but, yeah, any other highlights  on that article or things that you would \nmaybe adjust or add to it since writing it?Croesus (08:09):\nI feel like I  was in the right zone, in the \nright place to write that article.  I’ve been surprised at how much it resonated with \nother people, people with similar backgrounds.Preston Pysh (08:23):\nWhat has any of them come around since then?Croesus (08:27):\nGood question. So, begrudgingly, half  I’d say of my MBA friends, my close friend group \nfrom business school, have a Bitcoin position  and I’d say, yeah, they’re, for the most part, \nwholecoiners. Just barely got them to that point.Preston Pysh (08:47):\nWhat drove it? Is it  because they’re seeing the squares and the Teslas?Croesus (08:51):\nYeah. Square was a big one,  and the expected competitive response from Venmo I \nthink motivated them to try to get some per year.Preston Pysh (09:01):\nNow, PayPal, yeah.Croesus (09:03):\nYeah, but NYDIG was a big one for them, too,  because the extent to which that it makes it \na serious asset class and calls attention to  the fact that here you have this company that’s \nfacilitating institutions and insurance companies  and pension funds to take positions in Bitcoin. \nThat’s what they do. That’s their business model,  and they’re getting engagement from the top-tier \ninsurance companies like the CEO of New York Life.  For the first time in that company’s 150-plus-year \nhistory, the sitting C of that company has joined  an external board, and that is the board of NYDIG. \nThat doesn’t happen, and that means something.  Then now in the last week, we have Ray Dalio’s \nCFO leaving to join NYDIG, a Bitcoin company.Croesus (09:55):\nThe people who have done their due diligence  on Wall Street, the people who have got around \nto that have taken positions, and that arrow  goes in one direction. The more you learn about \nBitcoin, the more you add to your allocation.  I think that my business school friends see \nenough of that happening that they’re like,  “I should probably have a hedge,” and I think \nthat’s where their heads are at right now.Preston Pysh (10:17):\nYeah. A lot of the NYDIG stuff is crazy. There was  something that I was reading where they were \nprojecting that 300 banks were going to have  or enable access for their clients to start buying \nBitcoin by the end of this year was the estimate.Croesus (10:33):\nSo, I don’t know if you remember last  summer the OCC came out with a guidance letter \nto banks saying that they were allowed to have  cryptocurrency custody products. That, to me, was \nthis signal that banks are actively petitioning to  this regulatory body that they want in on this, \nand they want to be able to offer a Bitcoin  savings account next to your dollar savings \naccount and collect all the fees that they can  collect on that for retail consumers. So, that was \nnine months ago that that guidance came out. Now,  the next step of that appears to be happening. \nIt’s rolling out to retail banking customers.Preston Pysh (11:21):\nI want to talk about  another article that you published, and \nthis was called Am I Too Late for Bitcoin?  There are tons of people that are \nout there that are looking at Bitcoin  that don’t know anything about finance in general, \nand they’re looking at it and saying, “Well,  I clearly can’t buy that,” and they’re saying, \n“I missed that boat, but Dogecoin is 30 cents.  So, I should probably buy a little bit \nof Doge.” Talk to us about your article,  and then frame this up for that person \nwho’s saying that to themselves right now.Croesus (11:55):\nSo, I spent my 20s as a  management consultant, and what I was trained to \ndo on approaching problems is to kick the tires,  look at it from different angles, and \nrun some numbers for yourself to size  things. So, that was my instinct when I went down \nthe Bitcoin rabbit hole, and one of the exercises  I went through was trying to figure out where \nwe were in terms of the tech adoption curve.Croesus (12:24):\nSo, if I believe that Bitcoin is the best savings  vehicle in the history of the world because of \nits monetary properties, which we can get into  and we should get into, but if it is the best \nsavings technology, the best vehicle for savings  out there today, then it’s a tech-enabled \ndisruption of how savings is done,  then you’d expect it to follow \nthe classic tech adoption curve  that we see with the internet or with television \nwhen it first came out or with social media,  any new product in that S curve that starts \noff slow and then speeds up once you hit  the middle of the bell curve of technology \nadopters, and then tails off at a plateau.Croesus (13:11):\nSo, in that S curve, where are we?  To figure that out, you have to take sock of \nwhat’s the total number of people who will  eventually adopt this technology, and to do \nthat, if it is the best savings technology,  then anybody who has wealth to save is your target \nmarket. There are 2.2 billion people in the world  with $10,000 or more of net worth. So, those \nare the people that Bitcoin is targeting.Croesus (13:40):\nThen at the same time,  we can also look at on-chain data to see \nhow many addresses have a meaningful amount  of Bitcoin in them. This is a thing \nthat people get caught up on, where  it’s hard to draw a line about what \nconstitutes meaningful adoption of Bitcoin.  I’ve heard numbers like there are 180 million \npeople who have some amount of cryptocurrency,  but that includes everybody, any tiny \nfractional amount that somebody forgot about  play theme money that $5 here and Dogecoin. \nI wouldn’t call that meaningful at option.Croesus (14:17):\nToday,  Newsweek said there are 46 million Americans \nwith … I forget if it’s Bitcoin or crypto,  but it’s a big number. I think it’s not \nrepresentative of the meaningful option. I  think that constitutes Americans that have \nthrown 20 bucks at Bitcoin in Robin Hood.Preston Pysh (14:36):\n10 bucks, yeah.Croesus (14:36):\nThey haven’t adopted it  as an actual savings vehicle. So, what would \nbe a reasonable threshold for a meaningful  amount of savings in Bitcoin? I just \ncalled it 0.1 Bitcoin, which is now $5,000.  So, that’s a meaningful amount of savings. \nAnything more than that is certainly meaningful.  You can see on-chain there are three million \naddresses with 0.1 Bitcoin in them. Of course,  it’s not quite apples to apples because a person \ncan have multiple addresses above that threshold,  but the bigger issue is that a lot of people \njust leave their Bitcoin on exchanges.Croesus (15:14):\nSo, how many people are leaving  a meaningful amount of Bitcoin on exchanges and \nnot taking self-custody? Probably a lot. Let’s  round that three million up to 10 million. So, if \nwe have 10 million meaningful adopters of Bitcoin  and there’s 2.2 billion that will eventually \nadopt this savings technology, that puts us at  half a percent penetration, half a percent into \nthe technology S curve. That’s really early.Croesus (15:42):\nThe innovators stage in the classic bell curve,  you got your innovators, your early adopters and \nyour mainstream. The innovators is the first 2.5%,  I think, or 2%. The early stages of the \ninnovators stage still. It’s crazy, really.Preston Pysh (15:59):\nWe’re talking standard deviations.  What would that be in the bell curve? In your \narticle, you were saying that it was around 2.6  standard deviations on the left \nside of the bell curve. It’s crazy.Croesus (16:11):\nYeah. It’s crazy early. If you’re 2.6 standard  deviations from the mean in anything, you’re \ndoing great or you’re doing really poorly, one  of the other. Yeah. So, it’s crazy early still. \nThe other way to look at that is by assessing how  cheap it is to get one human’s worth of \nBitcoin still. The way to run those numbers  is Bitcoin is for the whole world, and there’s \nonly going to be 21 million of them ever. So,  eight billion in population. 21 million divided by \neight billion, you get I think it’s around 250,000  sats. So, 0.0025 Bitcoin. That is \ncurrently what you can buy for $150.Croesus (17:02):\nIf Bitcoin becomes  the preferred store value asset for the digital \nfuture, which we think it’s on track to become,  then one human’s worth of it can be secured \nby anybody for $150 today, which means it’s so  early that you could feasibly set up a dollar cost \naveraging plan for yourself to stack one human’s  worth of Bitcoin every month or even every week \nif you wanted to still. That’s how early it is.Preston Pysh (17:35):\nTalk to us about  the valuation process that you use. I really \nlike how you laid this out. In your article,  you go into a lot of the adoption process. You \nsay that there are two different ways to really  know where we’re at. The one was the adoption \nprocess, which you just described there,  and then you also get into this valuation \nprocess, and you go through all these  different stores of value and the total \naddressable market from a market cap size.Croesus (17:58):\nYeah. So, this was part  of the consultant’s approach to sizing this \nproblem. I went through and I tried to find  good solid numbers for all of the different store \nvalue buckets that exist in the world. Humans  have found a variety of assets that are in \ndiffering ways scarce and because of their  scarcity, they are good stores of value \nbecause they’re assets that other people desire  and there’s a limited amount of them, \nwhether that is real estate or equities.Croesus (18:38):\nThe tricky thing about  equities is that it is scarce. You can create \na new company and that company has new shares  and all that, but what is scarce \nis the ownership percentage  of a certain market, that portion \nof the economy. That’s scarce.Croesus (18:56):\nSo, owning equities is  scarce. Owning art is scarce. Collectibles, some \nof them have value and retain value over time.  All of those buckets add up to something \nlike $400 trillion and, of course,  the massive bucket of bonds, and there’s 200 \nplus trillion in bonds, and 20 trillion in  negative yielding bonds, which means that whoever \nis holding those bonds has no better idea or plan  of what else to hold, and that’s the only reason \nthey’re willing to take that hit, basically.Croesus (19:29):\nSo, ostensively, as people  learn about the properties of Bitcoin and how its \nincreasing scarcity over time causes its value to  increase over time, there will be an exodus, \na shift away from holding assets like  negative yielding bonds or even low yielding \nbonds, which is the rest of the 200 trillion,  and towards shifting from those assets and \ninto something that appreciates reliably,  predictably over time because of its \nmonetary properties that are built into it.Croesus (20:03):\nSo, I went through that exercise of  trying to assess what’s a reasonable \namount of this store value bucket that  Bitcoin with its superior store \nvalue properties could reasonably  capture. Summing those up, 30% here, 50% there, \n10% here, I got to a number of 200 trillion,  which would mean capturing about half of \nthe store value total market in the world.Croesus (20:32):\nThat isn’t even addressing the currency  value, which I think there’s $100 trillion in \ncurrency in the world and three-level currency,  and Bitcoin would capture a large \nportion, if not the bulk of that as well.Croesus (20:47):\nSo, yeah, you get to a $200 trillion  total full potential with Bitcoin in today’s \ndollars and, of course, those nominal values will  balloon as inflation drives money printing, \nand money printing then drives inflation,  and that comes out to $10 \nmillion per Bitcoin, which is-Preston Pysh (21:05):\nAs we now define power today.Croesus (21:07):\nYou’re right.  That number, I still feel uncomfortable \ntalking about that number.Preston Pysh (21:13):\nI think most people do.Croesus (21:15):\nYeah. It’s hard to  take that seriously because that sounds like \nwishful thinking. It sounds like the thing that  I am excited about is going to take over the world \nand that sounds a little delusional, but that’s  the result of kicking the tires on this thing \nfor thousands of hours and running the numbers.Preston Pysh (21:34):\nYou see Michael Saylor throwing  around the same numbers. That doesn’t make it \nright. I’m just saying that there are other  people that aren’t looking at maybe your math \nand they’re coming up with very similar figures.Croesus (21:46):\nTo be fair, a year ago when I was talking  to my MBA friends in our Zoom happy hour saying \nthat this thing is going to 100,000 next year-Preston Pysh (21:55):\nYou were nuts.Croesus (21:56):\n… that was laughable, right? Yeah.Preston Pysh (21:59):\nYeah, it’s wild.  Let’s cover this other idea that you have talked \nabout. You’re saying that the digital revolution  has two parts. You talk about information \nand value. Explain what you mean by this.Croesus (22:14):\nSo, I like to think about the really zoomed out  view of how Bitcoin fits into monetary \nhistory and what it means for human progress.  Part of that is to take stock of what we are \nliving through right now in human history.  It’s a very special and crazy time because \nwe are living through the digital revolution.  For the most part, we think of that as \nthe internet. That’s what comes to mind.Croesus (22:46):\nWhat is the internet?  The internet is the digitization of \ninformation and information exchange,  and so that meant we took the default of \nhow we exchange and access information  went from physical with libraries and \nmagazine subscriptions and newspapers  to digital with the internet, and that process has \nbeen going on for the last 20 plus years. We’re  far up the S curve on that process. We’re arguably \ncoming towards the plateau of that process.Croesus (23:24):\nThe world’s information has been digitized  for the most part at this point, but it hasn’t \nbeen possible to digitize value because,  on the internet, everything can be copied, and you \ncan’t do that with value because then it loses its  value, then it can be stolen. That’s what Bitcoin \nrepresents is this invention of digital scarcity,  the invention of a system that allows for  value to not be copied, be impossible \nto copy in the digital realm.Croesus (23:55):\nThat  is this parallel stream to the internet and \nTCP/IP and the protocols of the internet enabling  information exchange through that ecosystem. Now, \nwe have a new protocol, a new set of rules for  the secure storage and exchange of value in the \ndigital space. What we’re watching with Bitcoin  is this bootstrapping from nothingness into the \ndigital store of value of the world, digital  value protocol of the world, and that means \na second internet of sorts that this is the  internet of value to complement the \nexisting internet of information.Croesus (24:44):\nIn that S curve, we’re still at the very  beginning stages, right? So, I think that it’s \nsomething that we don’t talk enough about,  the zoomed out view of what is happening in the \nworld right now and what Bitcoin means in terms of  this grand sweeping reality of in our lifetimes \ngoing from physical value, which is what the world  has known for all of human history to digital \nvalue in the same way that the internet took  us from physical information to digital \ninformation over the course of a few decades.Preston Pysh (25:18):\nYou have a chart that is really cool that shows  the application layer that’s being built on top \nof the existing protocols of the internet today,  and then how that’s going to potentially look \nin the future and how this value layer is going  to work itself into the protocol stack. Can \nyou describe what’s going on there for folks  that might not be intimately familiar with how \nthe internet works and what this all means for  businesses, incentive structures moving \nforward? I have an interest in what that  might mean for social media. What \nare some of your thoughts on that?Croesus (25:54):\nYeah. So, how does the internet work? I’m not the  most technical person, but I have the high-level \ngrasp of this. There are a series of protocols  like TCP/IP, which is just rules for how servers \ncan exchange packets of information, and have that  be represented as meaningful through browsers and \nwhatever other portals. That’s how the internet is  constructed, but that base layer, that protocol \nlayer cannot be owned because it’s just code,  it’s just rules for how to exchange information. \nThere’s no ownership layer at the protocol layer,  but what you can own are the businesses that \nare built on top of those protocols, so Amazon,  Netflix, Facebook, these entities, these \nbusinesses that are fundamentally built on  top of those protocols and their whole business \nmodel is based on being internet businesses.Croesus (26:54):\nYou can own those individual pieces, those  parts of the internet economy, but you can’t own \nthe internet itself. So, the best you can do is  if you’re a VC, you can invest in the next wave of \na bunch of different promising internet companies  and hope that one of them becomes a big win and a \nbig part of the next generation of the internet.Croesus (27:16):\nSimilarly, if you’re investing in equities,  you can own an index like the Nasdaq. That can \nbe your portfolio on how you get exposure to  the overall internet, but in doing that, you’re \nowning small pieces of a bunch of the different  businesses built on top of the protocol. \nThat’s very different from how Bitcoin  is designed because, by definition, \nthis is a value protocol.  There’s a value layer that someone has to \nown. It’s required for this thing to work.Croesus (27:48):\nSo, this protocol, the Bitcoin network, which  is a set of rules for how the nodes and users on \nthe Bitcoin network can send and receive and store  their Bitcoin, and you can’t own that. You can’t \nown the network itself, but there’s a unit, a unit  of account, a transactional unit, the symbol of \nwho owns what on this network, which you can own.  In this case, that means that you can take an \nownership slice of the overall pie, the whole  internet of value simply by owning a piece of the \nunderlying unit that makes the whole thing run.Croesus (28:30):\nSo, what we’re starting  to see on top of this protocol are the \nbusinesses that are growing and popping up  and the ecosystem that’s developing, \nfor-profit businesses built on top of this  ecosystem, on top of this protocol. So, that \nincludes exchanges like Coinbase. That is  based on making a business out of getting a cut of \ntransactions happening on the Bitcoin network and  other networks, too. It also includes \ncompanies like Fold or Strike, which are  these new generation of consumer-facing, \nuser-empowering Bitcoin services  that are using the protocol underneath it to \ncreate some new product that has real value to  the consumer based on the advantages of Bitcoin as \ndigital value over traditional financial products.Preston Pysh (29:26):\nLet’s talk about this term that’s used  a lot in the community, which is the speculative \nattack on fiat currency. I think Pierre Rochard  was the first one or is it Michael Goldstein? \nOne of those two was using this. Pierre-Croesus (29:41):\nPierre wrote this in 2014.Preston Pysh (29:43):\nSo, you put quite a bit of meat on the bone  for this idea in an article, which \nwe’ll have in the show notes.  You get into the DNA of an asset. \nTalk to us about what that is  and then talk to us about what this speculative \nattack really represents as far as your concern.Croesus (30:01):\nYeah. So, I guess what I’m trying to do on Twitter  is to put out educational content that simplifies \nwhat I’ve come to understand or believe about  Bitcoin and convey that educational message, \nand because of my background as a consultant,  as an MBA and someone who took a lot of \naccounting classes, I have this view about how  different assets perform over time, and that \nis that the best thing you can do historically  over recent history for your net worth is to \ninvest in assets like stocks and real estate  because they appreciate over time because they’re \ngenerating some kind of return, and they’re either  growing or they’re, in the case of stocks, \nthey’re growing or they might be generating  dividends. Similar dynamics with property you \nown and appreciate some value, can generate rent.Croesus (30:59):\nSo, that’s an exponential curve up into the right  if you have an asset that performs. So, in a \nlogarithmic scale, that means a straight line  up into the right. That’s the nature of those \ninvestible assets like stocks and real estate.  Their DNA is such that they appreciate \nover time if you invest in good ones.Croesus (31:24):\nOn the flip side, on the downside, there are  other things you can do with your money. You can \nconsume it. You can buy clothing and whatever and  immediately the value of that clothing after \nyou buy it drops dramatically to nothingness.  You could invest in a car, which is not an \ninvestment at all. It’s a form of consumption  because you’re purchasing a depreciating \nasset. The way that assets depreciate is  an exponential curve down into the right. \nIf you put that on a logarithmic scale,  that means a straight line down into the right.Croesus (32:00):\nSo, we have this landscape  of different assets, and they perform differently \nover time based on their DNA, what the asset is.  To add to this picture, you have to also include \ndollars, fiat currency. It is by design that the  root idea of the dollar system is that we’re going \nto print 2% more of it on average every year,  and that means it’s an exponential decay of \nfunction, and so that means that it may not  depreciate as fast as a car or lose its purchasing \npower as fast as storing value in a car,  but it does on a logarithmic. It is \na straight line down into the right.Croesus (32:46):\nThen contrasting with that is this  new kind of currency, this new digital currency of \nBitcoin whose design is increasing the scarcity.  To me, that’s the root of what Bitcoin is \nor why it’s an attractive asset to hold  is because of the halvings, because of the \nsupply issuance schedule. They’re making  less of it. It’s the only asset in the world \nthey’re making less and less of over time,  which means that if you hold some today, you are \nbuying in at a time when they’re making more of it  than they will be making of it four years from \nnow because of that supply issuance schedule.Croesus (33:26):\nSo, that increasing scarcity over time,  because of the supply-demand balance of today, \nthere’s 900 Bitcoin being mined every day,  and that’s going out into the market \nto meet net inflowing demand, and  we’re in the process of finding some \nnew equilibrium based on that amount  of supply issuance per day because a \nyear ago, just over a year ago, it was  1,800 Bitcoin per day, and that got cut in half. \nSo, now, we’re in this price discovery mode of  trying to find the right equilibrium for this new \nera of Bitcoin, and then three years from now,  that will be cut in half again and we’ll be \nproducing 450 Bitcoin per day, and that increasing  scarcity means that there won’t be enough supply \nto meet the demand at the equilibrium point we  established during this current reward era, \nwhich means the price will have to drift upwards.Preston Pysh (34:29):\nI got a question on that  because there was a question that came from \nTwitter from Eddie, and he’s curious whether  we’re going to start to see these halvings priced \nin to the current price. So, I think at this point  there’s been much debate leading up to the halving \nevents. People have made the case of why it can’t  be priced and why it is already priced, but having \nseen this multiple times now, I think it’s become  fool me once, all right, shame on you, fool me \ntwice, fool me the third time. Are we going to get  a chance for Wall Street to sit on the sidelines \nand we go through a whole another four-year cycle  waiting for the halving to happen or are we going \nto start to see that get priced into the curve?Croesus (35:22):\nThat’s a great question. I don’t really know.Preston Pysh (35:25):\nIf you had to place a bet,  one way or the other, what would you say?Croesus (35:28):\nMy bet is that Wall  Street is in disbelief and can’t comprehend \nthe implications of the imminent halving.Preston Pysh (35:38):\nLet’s say it goes to 200,000  in this year we’re at right now, in 2021. \nLet’s say by the end of the year this thing  goes to 200,000 or even higher. What does Wall \nStreet do at that point as they’re looking at  this thing and saying, “My God! This is \ngoing to happen again in a few years”?Croesus (35:58):\nSo, I think that like the stock-to-flow model  has it pegged to go to a million dollars \nin the next cycle and that’s going to give  everybody in traditional finance, \nthey’re going to bulk at that,  I think. You talking about a total valuation twice \nthat of gold in 15 years of Bitcoin’s existence.Preston Pysh (36:21):\nAt the same time, they’re looking at  miners that keep coming online and they’re looking \nat something that has a difficulty adjustment  that is adjusting itself to ensure that some \nportion of those miners remain profitable.  Now that we’re getting their attention, nothing \ngets their attention like an imaginary coin  that’s over $100,000 in valuation, right? So, \nthey’re going to start digging in. They’re  going to start realizing that you can’t pull \nthe supply curve to the left. You can’t pull the  production from the future further to the left by \nquadrupling the number of miners. It can’t happen,  at least not in any type of meaningful timeframe, \nright? They can do it for a week, but that’s it.Preston Pysh (37:06):\nSo, they’re going to start to understand  what that means, especially when you compare it \nto what would that mean if gold, if we look at  the gold market and no matter how many people you \nbring to mine that gold, you’re not going to pull  more ounces out of the ground than a certain rate \nthat you’re currently in as far as an epoch goes.Preston Pysh (37:26):\nThen magically in four years, you’re just going  to find half as much gold in the earth’s crust. \nPeople can start to do that analysis and say,  “Whoa! Maybe this is a million dollars. \nMaybe I need to start front running that.”Preston Pysh (37:41):\nI don’t know. I just think that at this point  there’s so much that’s been written about this and \nyou’re getting so much attention, and I don’t mean  to push back on your point of view. I guess I’m \ntrying to challenge that point of view for you.Croesus (37:54):\nI think you have more  faith in the capacity of Wall Street to imagine \na changed world four years in the future or  even a year after a halving. I think that you’re \nright, though, that there will be some portion,  some larger slice of the finance community that \nfor the next halving says, “I’m going to get ahead  of this. I’m going to front run it. I’m going to \nbuy it in the six months, nine months before,”  and that should happen. There should be some \npricing in of the halving, but I think that  what we keep seeing is disbelief at how \nfast the status quo changes with Bitcoin.Croesus (38:37):\nPeople aren’t prepared  to accept it as what it is today, let alone \nwhat it is going to be four years from now  or if you’re right before the halving, a year \nfrom now. A larger portion of the world will  wrap their heads around that, but I think that as \nhumans we’re good at optimizing for conditions as  they are today, and as a collective organism, \nwe find equilibrium with how things are today,  and we struggle to project forward how things \nmight change. I think that’s particularly  true when the way in which something \nis going to change is outside of how  everything else changes, which is to say that \nit’s inelastic to our reaction to it. You can’t  increase Bitcoin mining, and that’s different \nfrom every other commodity in the world.Croesus (39:31):\nSo, I think Wall Street and humans,  generally, will continue to underestimate how \ndifferent Bitcoin is going to be four years from  now just because we have no basis for comparison. \nWe have no other examples of a pre-programmed  supply schedule that is completely indifferent \nto how much we would like to increase supply.Preston Pysh (39:57):\nYeah, and what I’m thinking about,  let’s say you buy into the stock-to-flow model. \nLet’s say that on this current epoch that we’re  in the price settles in at $100,000 or $200,000, \nand you’re looking at a price four years later  of a million. When you do a compound annual growth \nrate of what growth rate am I getting if I’m going  from 100,000 to a million over a four-year \nperiod of time, and where else on the market  can I find that kind of return? Nowhere, right? \nYou’re like, “Maybe I should keep holding this.  Maybe I shouldn’t realize my capital gains and \nplay the trading game here. Maybe I should just  do what intelligent investors do when \nthey know that they’ve got a winner.”Preston Pysh (40:41):\nIf for whatever reason  something fundamentally changes with the hash \nrate and miners and all that kind of stuff and  you’re seeing it fundamentally fall apart between \nthe cycles, well, sure, maybe you need to change.Croesus (40:52):\nYeah. This is actually how I  became a Bitcoin maximus was the stock-to-flow \nmodel came out in 2019 and before that,  I had been in Altcoiner. I started with Ethereum \nand was into that whole ecosystem, and then the  stock-to-flow model comes out in 2019, and it \nsounds so crazy, but it has this, I don’t know,  I suppose familiar analytical rigor around it \nthat is the signpost to me that the person who  made this is very smart, and I should pay \nattention to or at least kick the tires on this.Croesus (41:26):\nSo, I spent the next couple of months  trying to figure out why it couldn’t be true \nand ran my own numbers that basically said that  this is totally plausible if we follow the classic \ntech adoption S curve, and we are aware. We talked  about earlier at the very beginning of that \nS curve, demand is going to rapidly ramp up  for Bitcoin, and at the same time, we have \nhalf as much being produced every halving era.Croesus (41:58):\nWhen you smash those two datasets together,  that comes out to a 10x increase in adoption \nadjusted scarcity, if you want to call it that  every four years for the next \n20-25 years, which is crazy,  and that’s what the stock-to-flow model is \nsuggesting also is a 10x increase every halving.Croesus (42:21):\nIt’s hard to pin down exactly why  is it working. I think it’s somehow capturing our \nhuman nature of valuing scarcity and this osmotic  flow of value from that which is not \nscarce to that which is more scarce,  the constant relevel setting of \nthese different store value buckets.Croesus (42:50):\nI’m using this osmosis idea of if you have  two water containers that have an osmotic membrane \nbetween them and you add salt to one of them,  water is going to flow into the \none that has salt because that’s  osmotic pressure goes in that direction. It seems \nlike that’s what is built into us humans is an  appreciation for scarcity and a desire to own that \nwhich is scarce as a scoreboard in our culture.Croesus (43:23):\nActually, to zoom out all the way, this is  fundamental to our species that \nI think in, yeah, shelling out  Szabo includes this amazing little anecdote \nthat he doesn’t really expand upon, but shell  money goes back 75,000 years. There’s evidence \nof it in cave sites going back 75,000 years,  but that’s for Homo sapiens, our subspecies. \nHomo sapiens, Neanderthals, Neanderthalensis,  their cave sites don’t have \nany evidence of shell money.Croesus (44:00):\nWhat’s interesting about that is that  the population, can’t really paint any notable \ndifferences between Neanderthals and Homo sapiens  besides the tools that Homo sapiens \nwere using were slightly better  and this notable difference of there doesn’t \nappear to be money in the Neanderthal sites.Croesus (44:22):\nThe result of that is that the  population density of the human, the Homo sapiens, \nsapiens’ caves appears to be 10 times as great.  So, having this appreciation, this species \nlevel appreciation for scarcity, which makes  money possible and facilitates trade and allows \nyou to support a larger population density and  emergent civilization level behavior \nappears to be the difference that our  species, the advantage that our species had over \nother early human groups, which is to say that  appreciating scarcity is what makes us \nhuman, and valuing scarcity is what makes  us human. Therefore, it’s in our DNA to \ngravitate towards that which is scarce.Croesus (45:11):\nSo, if you put  Bitcoin in this long timeline of human history, \nit is this perfection of that which makes us human  that we are now witnessing this creation \nof something which is absolutely scarce  and slowly moving towards absolute scarcity, and \nthe whole world is slowly processing this reality  and the economic reality that this invention \nimposes upon the world cannot be escaped.Preston Pysh (45:44):\nWhen you look at Adam Smith’s main thesis, which  is the division of labor, and the ability that it \nallows humans to collaborate in a meaningful way,  where I perform a task that’s very skilled \nand the person next to me performs another  task that’s completely different than mine \nthat’s very skilled and we’re able to exchange  those units of work in a meaningful way, you \ncan see how if you can optimize that system  without there being blemishes or manipulation \nentering itself into the system and the protocol  that’s beings used to manage the labor \ndata is how I would like to describe it.Croesus (46:25):\nThe price signaling of labor.Preston Pysh (46:26):\nThe pricing, yes. You can just see how  vital it is. If I was going to be a real optimist \nhere, it’s pretty exciting to think about what the  implications of such a sound majoring system would \nbe on a global scale and what that might mean.Croesus (46:45):\nWhat a strange time  to live through. It’s hard to believe \nthat this is part of our own history.Preston Pysh (46:53):\nHappening in our lives. Yeah.  Happening in our lifetimes. I know. I think \nabout that often. I agree with you. I think  it’s humbling to think that we’re living through \nthis period at this transition. It’s crazy.Croesus (47:03):\nYeah. For all of human history, we’ve had physical  stores of value and this is the zero to one moment \nof going from analog to digital. It’s right now.Preston Pysh (47:18):\nTalk to us about you’re saying early on  you were really interested in \nEthereum and then you found  your way to Bitcoin. Talk to us about what \nwas the original thing that drove you there  or that enticed you to look into that, and then \ntalk about your transition over to Bitcoin.Croesus (47:35):\nI guess I characterize this in hindsight,  for me, there are two stages, two major stages \nto the rabbit hole, and I think everybody  is going down the rabbit hole and they’re at \ndifferent stages. The first stage is recognizing  that digital value has a place today and into the \nfuture. I think that that’s where Ethereum people  are. That’s where Altcoiners are is you recognize \nthat we live in a digital world, we live on the  internet. I grew up on the internet, and this \nmakes sense to me. Digital value, being able to  exchange value and store value in a digital format \nmakes sense. Of course, this is going to be thing.Croesus (48:20):\nThen the second stage of the rabbit  hole is realizing why Bitcoin has already won, \nand what it really deeply means, which is to say  that this is not about technology. It’s about \nmoney and where does Bitcoin fit in into the  landscape, the history of money, how does it \nimprove upon the prior iterations of money,  how does it improve upon gold, why is it better \nthan fiat, and importantly, why is it going to  win out over those things, understanding \nthat the network effects of money  and shelling point reality of money and \nthe significance of absolute scarcity.Croesus (49:04):\nSo, yeah. I started, I dipped  my head into the rabbit hole and I saw this party \ngoing on in Altcoins and thought, “This is great.  This is totally the thing,” and that’s because \nI was steeped and we all have been steeped in  this ethos of internet, how the internet worked, \nhow internet adoption, how internet businesses  and internet ecosystem developed, and that was \ndriven by innovation, new companies popping up  trying something new, move fast and break \nthings, the whole Silicon Valley ethos.Croesus (49:35):\nOur approach to investing in technology  has been shaped by the cumulative experience \nof how the internet developed, meaning that  we all take a venture capitalist approach to \ninvesting in tech stocks, investing in internet  companies because that was the best way to do \nit because you couldn’t own the protocol itself.Croesus (49:58):\nSo, when I arrived in crypto scene,  I looked around and thought, “All right. \nWhat’s innovation? Where are upstart protocols  challenging incumbents?” Ethereum was the first \none in 2016 that seemed like it was falling that  narrative, and then I got into other Altcoins. \nThen I got crushed in the bear market, 2018-2019,  and that, plus the stock-to-flow model forced me \nto dig deeper and realized. You only realize then  that, “Oh, wait. This rabbit hole, this first \nlayer of the rabbit hole isn’t the whole thing.  There’s actually little back corner where if you \ndig a little deeper you discover that there’s a  whole another chamber below, and it’s more \nglorious because it’s a very different vibe  in there. It’s not a party. It’s a beacon of \nhope and sunshine for the future of humanity.”Croesus (50:56):\nI think most people,  our worldview has been shaped by recent history \nand the learned wisdom of the internet revolution.  So, we think that innovation is what matters. \nThat’s why everybody is caught by Ethereum, and  I think that it fits our worldview, the status \nquo worldview better, the Ethereum narrative,  but the truth is is that Bitcoin is an \neconomic reality that will continue to  play out and overpower any narrative. The \nsooner you dig down below that first level  of the rabbit hole to understand why \nthis is true, the better off you are.Preston Pysh (51:39):\nCroesus, man,  this was fun. I really enjoyed chatting with you. \nKeep pumping out this awesome content for people  that were listening to this that maybe want to \ndigest this in a more graphic kind of way. He has  awesome graphics that go with the articles. \nI’ll have the show notes with all these  articles in there. Is there anything else \nthat you want to provide a handoff to?Croesus (52:01):\nA lot of stuff, a lot  of educational content that I try to put out. I’m \ntrying to do my part to communicate the value that  can be have from stacking sats and the benefit \nthat can create for people and their families. A  lot of that educational content is best seen \nwith your own eyes and the graphics convey the  message a little bit better. So, check out \nmy Twitter, I guess, which is @Croesus_btc.Preston Pysh (52:31):\nAll right.
