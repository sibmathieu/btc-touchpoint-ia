throughthe setup processjust so you can see what to expect whenyou areinitializing this app and it can varybased on your jurisdiction so just keepthat in mindi am in canada here um this is earlyaccess to the appso i can't hook up a bank account oranything like that with itif you are an individual that wants todo thatbut just know that if you're in the usright now you can do that and you may beable

codeyou pick a username where do you live umphone number what's your name date ofbirthjust some general id stuff if you havean id and again this can vary based onjurisdiction now in terms ofsetting up a bank account with thisthing just so you know if you're in theusit is possible to do that right now andthis could bechange for other jurisdictions later buteffectivelyon one of the tabs on your profile tabthere's something that says paymentmethods that you click onat that point you can then add a bankaccount or a debitcard and then it will take you to thisthing called plaidwhere effectively you can log in withyour banking credentialsto then link that account with yourstrike app and that's basically it so ittook a few minutes to go throughi think maybe max two three minutestook me to get through that of course ido not have a bank account linked withitso i'm kind of seeing this through theeyes of somebody who is perhapsunbanked so that gives me a little bitof perspective ofhow you guys may be using the app ifyou're somewhere like thatuh let's dive into the app itself andget set upall right so just a quick overview ofwhat you're gonna see in the app here ofcoursesome of this information will be missingif you are starting freshwith a brand new app here but on themain screen herewhat you see is down at the bottom thereare three little tabs and those are kindof your main screens that you're goingto be dealing withthis main screen here the initial onethe home screenwill have a balance in dollars orwhatever your local currency isup top down below here you will have alist of people that you haveinteracted with maybe sent payments toat the bottom of this page you'll have arequestand a pay button where you can receiveor sendfunds to other individualsnow if we hit the middle button thelittle clockthis shows any previous transactions anynotes on themwho they were from if it was fromsomebody on the strike app themselvesor if it's just a general payment thenit will show upwithout any information about the personthat sent itand finally on the far right at thebottom this is your profile pagewhere you have an invite code to invitepeople to the appyou have your deposit and withdrawalthis mostlywould pertain to if you have a bankaccount linked andyou want to deposit money from your bankinto strike so if you're working abroadand sending money home to peopleusing this method then you would depositmoney from your bank accountinto strike and then send it to yourfamily memberand then withdraw just exactly theopposite with drawing fundsuh into a bank account would bethe method that you use here now i won'tbe utilizing these methods because againi'm doing this from the perspective ofan individual that does not have a bankaccounthooked up here and finally the settingshereyou just have your profile your personalinformation any limits that you havepertaining to banks and so on and soforth and that's pretty much itso we can go back to the home screen andlet's startactually receiving money intothe strike app to receivemoney into strike simply from your homescreendown at the bottom left you're going tohit the request buttonnow there are a few different ways toreceivefunds into strike first offit brings you to a screen where you canreceive funds from anotherstrike user now you may or may not notknow somebodyon strike but if you do it's very simpleif you've interacted with them beforethey will be listed down below if youknow the person's username you can thenlook them up so if i type here i knowthatmy friend brekkie is on here and if istart typing in his name i can see himright there and i can say hey umi am doing a tutorialtest transaction and who knows if he'llactually send this butuh he will get a notification as to whati'm requestingi hit the white arrow up top and howmucham i requesting of him i'm just gonna uhsay five cents we'll see if he pays itlaterbut uh i hit next and it just confirmsall the informationfive cents for a tutorial testtransaction andi hit confirm and that sends a requestto his phone to his strike app sayingheybtc sessions would like to receive fivecents from you do you approveand if he does i will get a notificationthat i receive that paymentnow let's look at other methods ofreceivingmoney again if from the home screen ihit requestup in the top right corner there's alittle bitcoin band i can hit that and i can give this alabelor not i'm going to leave it blank fornow i'm going to hit the whitearrow and then how much would you liketo requestmaybe i'd like to request one dollar ihitnext now at this point i actuallyhave a few different ways to receive icanshare this code with anybody via any appor in the top right hand corner there'sa little qrcode square that i can tap onand this allows me to receive fundsuh via the lightning networkand so i can actuallycopy this or i can hit share rather andthere's a string of digits here that ican copyand i can send this information toanybodyand they will be able to send me fundsso for instancei have a bitcoin wallet here called moonwhich i've done a full tutorial onif i hit send and i paste in thatinformation that i just copiedit says okay great you want to send thismuch money to this individuali'm going to hit confirm i'm going tohit sendand i'm getting a notification right nowthat i've just received that moneyi can see it turns white and that meansi've received one dollarfrom somebody's bitcoin wallet so againto reiterateif i hit request and i hit the bitcoin bin the top rightand i can add a note if i like i choosethe amountand i hit the little qr code in the toprightthis gives me a lightning networkinvoice that i can sharewith anyone via any app that i likeand they can send me money that wayokay very very simple umvery easy to receive bitcoin paymentsthat wayand it gets instant converted we can seeinstant converted into dollars themoment it hits my accounti'm not holding bitcoin here i'm holdingdollars but i received bitcoin which wasinstant converted into dollarsnow in the first bitcoin example ishowed youa smaller amount a dollar however youcan receive of courselarger amounts here and that opens youup to other methods of bitcoin paymentlet me show you what i meanthe lightning network is designedspecificallywell not specifically but it works verywell withsmall payments so a dollar a pennywhatever amount you like it worksseamlessly with the lightning networkhowever for larger amounts um thatcan make sense to use bitcoin's uhwhat's known as a main chain or on-chainbitcoin transaction not utilizing thelightning networkso if i hit request here and i go to thebitcoin b againand i type a larger amount let's say50 dollars if i hit nextand again i go to the qr code in the toprighti now have the option to swipe over tothe rightand there is a bitcoin qr codei can copy that information just like idid before and i can navigate overto moon walletand i can hit send and this is anaddress that gets copied to theclipboard and it auto fills the amountand again i'll just put a little notehere strikeconfirm note and i'm sending aregular main chain bitcoin transactionand i can see that it's already paidalready availablein my strike app fifty dollars it doessaypending because it wasn't a lightningtransaction it was a regular bitcointransactionokay so keep that in mind if you aredealing with somebody thatisn't using the lightning network yetthey can stillsend bitcoin to this app which again isinstantly converted into dollars in youraccountregular bitcoin transactions requirewhat's known as aconfirmation which can take 10 minutesor more to officially be spendablewhereas a lightning transaction isinstantly available you can instantlyspend it so as soon as this isconfirmed officially on the bitcoinnetworkthen it will be spendable within mystrike appokay so three different ways to receivewith strike via a request from somebodyhere that you're interacting withthrough appear on strikevia the lightning network or via aregular on-chainbitcoin transaction if you would like tolearn aboutmoon wallet the one that i utilizedright here i have a full tutorial onthatand it is listed in the links down belowlet's learn how to send transactions outof strike nowjust a quick note here it's a coupleminutes later i do have a notificationyour request for 50 has been completedand when i navigate back to strike i canseethe payment has come in and is now greenis no longer grayed out that means it isnow spendableis now reflected in my balance whichjust moved upso we're now going to take a look atthree different ways to send fundsfrom my strike account to somebody elseso the first way we're going to do thisagain just from the home screenwe're gonna hit pay and first i'd liketo show you how to pay somebody that'salreadyon strike all right now before isent a request to my friend brekkiemaybe i'll send him a payment toojust to entice him to pay that requestsouh i'm going to search him up one moretime i haven't sent hima a transaction yet so he wasn't in mylist of contacts but i'll pull him uphereand then i'll just say testtransaction okay greatand let's send him againfive cents i'll hit nexti get to review my transaction does thatlook good that's who it's goingto yeah that looks great i'll hitconfirmand great all done sent he has nowreceived fivecents from me perfect and he's nowlistedactually in my contacts now that i'vesenthim a transactionnow let's say i want to sendmoney to a bitcoin walletso when i just sent money to brekkieherethat was in dollars or rather cents iguessi sent him five cents andthat stayed as us dollars as thattransaction happened there was noconversion betweendollars and bitcoin however if i want topay somebody in bitcoinor if i don't want to hold dollars i'drather hold bitcoin myselfi can send directly to a bitcoin walletso the example we'll use here is themoon walletand there's becky asking if i'm playingaround with strike i sure amdude so uhlet's go over the moon wallet the onethat we were using beforeand let's first do a lightningtransaction now againif you want to check out moon i do havethat fulltutorial and no there's no need to signup for anythingthis is another free app that you canutilize if you want to use bitcoinbut um i'm going to hit receive here inmoonand again it shows me two different waysto receive bitcoinor lightning again lightning better forsmaller transactionsbitcoin main chain probably better forlarger transactionsokay so let's do a lightning transactiondown at the bottom there's invoicesettings where i can choose how much i'dlike to receiveand let's just dolet's see uh let's do50 cents okay 0.50okay 50 cents so this creates what'sknown as a lightning invoicewhich i can then hit the copy button andthat's all i neednow if you're in front of somebody whohas a bitcoinlightning wallet you can actually scanthis qr codefrom the strike app and i'll show youhow to do that in a second but let'sjump back to strike we're going to hitpaynow instead of going to our our contactshere we're going to go up to the littleqr code in the top rightso this is what i was saying if you werestanding in front of somebody and theyhad that app open you could just scanthe qr code hereor you can hit the paste button if you'dcall if you've copied information or hadittexted to you you hit paste and itbrings upall of the digits that i just copiedfrom that other appand it's going to say exactlyhow much i'm sending this person okay soit's going to cost me an extra pennyto send that 50 cents that's prettyreasonable i would sayso it says do you want to send 50 centsto this invoicei'm gonna hit confirmokay great turns white it's all donelet's jump back to moonput in the pin really quick and if ijump backi can see i get a notification for a newtransactionif i press the up button it says that iwas paid just now from the lightningnetworkso we know that that transaction wentthrough fantasticso we can also pay a regularbitcoin transaction on the main chainokay so not lightning network butregular bitcoinlet's jump back to moon one more timeput in our pin and let's hit receiveand we're gonna use bitcoin so bitcoinis highlighted here we're not usinglightning network um and i'm not evengonnaadd an amount okay i'm just gonnause the address here you can sendany amount to this um we're just gonnajump backto all i needed to do was hit copy hereto copy this bitcoin addressand i'm going to hit pay and strikewe'll go to the little qr code on topright same thing as beforei could physically scan that qr codeor i can paste the information that ijust copied so i'm going to paste itand then it asks me how much do i wantto send this personokay so since it's a an on-chain bitcointransaction we're not using thelightning network for kind offaster cheaper i'm going to put inan amount let's say we'll send 25here okay i think that should bereasonable today we'll hit nextokay so it says hey you're going to besending 25to this bitcoin address and there'sgoing to be a 1.27fee now it's important to know this isnot a fee that gets paid to strikethe bitcoin on chain transactionsare they do carry fees umwhich are paid to what are known asbitcoin miners these are people thatexpend a lot of energybasically securing the bitcoin networkso that you know your transactions willnot be reversedokay so this is a bitcoin transactionfeewhich largely uh do not applyto the lightning network or they're sominimal that it's fractions of a pennythat you're payingso only do on-chain transactions hereif you need to if it's a higher amountandyou know 25 dollars a dollar fee i canhandle that i can stomach that so i'mgoing to hit confirmoh the payment expired hold on a secondhereokay so i'm going to hit confirmall right and so this sent a main chainfeewith a a main chain transaction with adollar20 fee to cover the mining fees forsecuring the bitcoin network i'm okaywith thati hit done and let's just jump over themoon hereand see what that shows up asback out okay so in moon here it saysthere's a little clock here and that'sbecause i've received anon-chain transaction for around 25 bucksof course this is calculating it insatoshi's which is uh there's a hundredmillion satoshi's in a single bitcoinbut it says it's confirming so i'mwaiting for a confirmation on thebitcoin networkwithin about 10 minutes that should bespendable from my moon walletso i was able to successfully send fundsout of my strike account three differentwaysone was to another strike user twowas to a lightning network invoiceand three was to a regular bitcoinaddressso you can interact with this manydifferent ways send and receivemany different ways now the last thing iwant to show you guysis the tip page which you can use toreceiveany amount from any person at any timewithout having tomanually request funds and this isreally really cooli utilize this i've been using this abunch in the past weekso if you just navigate down at thebottom to the right hereyour profile page you're going to seeyour profile your username and downbelow there's a little url that saysstrikedot me slash whatever your username isif you actually click on that there's apagethat can be accessed on mobile or on abrowserwhatever and this is your tip pageyou can send a tip to anybody that has astrike accountvia the lightning network or via strikevery very easily so i'll just show aquick examplelet's say i wanted to send a tip tosomebody forfive dollars and i was on their strikeuh tip pagevery simple i type in the amount i wantto sendi hit the tip button and then i getthis lightning invoice that can then besent tovery simple simply i can hit copyi'm going to jump over to moon reallyquick it's funny i'm tipping myselfum i'm gonna hit send i'm gonna paste inthat invoice that i just copied i couldof course scan it insteadi'm just gonna hit send and that getssent offand i can see it just went through as atip on strikeand then it refreshes back to normal ifi jump back into the appi can see hey i just received a paymentfor five bucksa strike tip cool so anybody can do thisif you have a strike accountand then you can refer people to yourstriketip page strike dot me slash usernameawesome just one final note here becauseagaini've been getting a lot of differentquestions about can you use this app toactually buy and sell bitcoinand the answer is absolutely yes theflow of itwould effectively be if you have a bankaccountlinked to your strike account you fundstrike with your bank account you willthen have dollarsin strike you then simply send atransactionfrom strike to any bitcoin wallet thatyou ownbecause at that point you're takingdollars from your bank account intostrikeand it instant converts them intobitcoin and sends it to a walletthat you yourself hold so you'reeffectively buying bitcoinwith that flow and the theuh actual fees are effectively zerookay very very low on the other side ofthingsif you also have a bank account linkedyou can sell bitcoin bysending bitcoin to strike and then usingstrike to withdrawto your bank account via your profilepage so i hope that makes sense i hopethat helps any of you looking to do thatthank you guys so much for watching asalwaysplease do remember

lightning network is designedspecificallywell not specifically but it works verywell withsmall payments so a dollar a pennywhatever amount you like it worksseamlessly with the lightning networkhowever for larger amounts um thatcan make sense to use bitcoin's uhwhat's known as a main chain or on-chainbitcoin transaction not utilizing thelightning networkso if i hit request here and i go to thebitcoin b againand i type a larger amount let's say50 dollars if i hit nextand again i go to the qr code in the toprighti now have the option to swipe over tothe rightand there is a bitcoin qr codei can copy that information just like idid before and i can navigate overto moon walletand i can hit send and this is anaddress that gets copied to theclipboard and it auto fills the amountand again i'll just put a little notehere strikeconfirm note and i'm sending aregular main chain bitcoin transactionand i can see that it's already paidalready availablein my strike app fifty dollars it doessaypending because it wasn't a lightningtransaction it was a regular bitcointransactionokay so keep that in mind if you aredealing with somebody thatisn't using the lightning network yetthey can stillsend bitcoin to this app which again isinstantly converted into dollars in youraccountregular bitcoin transactions requirewhat's known as aconfirmation which can take 10 minutesor more to officially be spendablewhereas a lightning transaction isinstantly available you can instantlyspend it so as soon as this isconfirmed officially on the bitcoinnetworkthen it will be spendable within mystrike appokay so three different ways to receivewith strike via a request from somebodyhere that you're interacting withthrough appear on strikevia the lightning network or via aregular on-chainbitcoin transaction if you would like tolearn aboutmoon wallet the one that i utilizedright here i have a full tutorial onthatand it is listed in the links down belowlet's learn how to send transactions outof strike nowjust a quick note here it's a coupleminutes later i do have a notificationyour request for 50 has been completedand when i navigate back to strike i canseethe payment has come in and is now greenis no longer grayed out that means it isnow spendableis now reflected in my balance whichjust moved upso we're now going to take a look atthree different ways to send fundsfrom my strike account to somebody elseso the first way we're going to do thisagain just from the home screenwe're gonna hit pay and first i'd liketo show you how to pay somebody that'salreadyon strike all right now before isent a request to my friend brekkiemaybe i'll send him a payment toojust to entice him to pay that requestsouh i'm going to search him up one moretime i haven't sent hima a transaction yet so he wasn't in mylist of contacts but i'll pull him uphereand then i'll just say testtransaction okay greatand let's send him againfive cents i'll hit nexti get to review my transaction does thatlook good that's who it's goingto yeah that looks great i'll hitconfirmand great all done sent he has nowreceived fivecents from me perfect and he's nowlistedactually in my contacts now that i'vesenthim a transactionnow let's say i want to sendmoney to a bitcoin walletso when i just sent money to brekkieherethat was in dollars or rather cents iguessi sent him five cents andthat stayed as us dollars as thattransaction happened there was noconversion betweendollars and bitcoin however if i want topay somebody in bitcoinor if i don't want to hold dollars i'drather hold bitcoin myselfi can send directly to a bitcoin walletso the example we'll use here is themoon walletand there's becky asking if i'm playingaround with strike i sure amdude so uhlet's go over the moon wallet the onethat we were using beforeand let's first do a lightningtransaction now againif you want to check out moon i do havethat fulltutorial and no there's no need to signup for anythingthis is another free app that you canutilize if you want to use bitcoinbut um i'm going to hit receive here inmoonand again it shows me two different waysto receive bitcoinor lightning again lightning better forsmaller transactionsbitcoin main chain probably better forlarger transactionsokay so let's do a lightning transactiondown at the bottom there's invoicesettings where i can choose how much i'dlike to receiveand let's just dolet's see uh let's do50 cents okay 0.50okay 50 cents so this creates what'sknown as a lightning invoicewhich i can then hit the copy button andthat's all i neednow if you're in front of somebody whohas a bitcoinlightning wallet you can actually scanthis qr codefrom the strike app and i'll show youhow to do that in a second but let'sjump back to strike we're going to hitpaynow instead of going to our our contactshere we're going to go up to the littleqr code in the top rightso this is what i was saying if you werestanding in front of somebody and theyhad that app open you could just scanthe qr code hereor you can hit the paste button if you'dcall if you've copied information or hadittexted to you you hit paste and itbrings upall of the digits that i just copiedfrom that other appand it's going to say exactlyhow much i'm sending this person okay soit's going to cost me an extra pennyto send that 50 cents that's prettyreasonable i would sayso it says do you want to send 50 centsto this invoicei'm gonna hit confirmokay great turns white it's all donelet's jump back to moonput in the pin really quick and if ijump backi can see i get a notification for a newtransactionif i press the up button it says that iwas paid just now from the lightningnetworkso we know that that transaction wentthrough fantasticso we can also pay a regularbitcoin transaction on the main chainokay so not lightning network butregular bitcoinlet's jump back to moon one more timeput in our pin and let's hit receiveand we're gonna use bitcoin so bitcoinis highlighted here we're not usinglightning network um and i'm not evengonnaadd an amount okay i'm just gonnause the address here you can sendany amount to this um we're just gonnajump backto all i needed to do was hit copy hereto copy this bitcoin addressand i'm going to hit pay and strikewe'll go to the little qr code on topright same thing as beforei could physically scan that qr codeor i can paste the information that ijust copied so i'm going to paste itand then it asks me how much do i wantto send this personokay so since it's a an on-chain bitcointransaction we're not using thelightning network for kind offaster cheaper i'm going to put inan amount let's say we'll send 25here okay i think that should bereasonable today we'll hit nextokay so it says hey you're going to besending 25to this bitcoin address and there'sgoing to be a 1.27fee now it's important to know this isnot a fee that gets paid to strikethe bitcoin on chain transactionsare they do carry fees umwhich are paid to what are known asbitcoin miners these are people thatexpend a lot of energybasically securing the bitcoin networkso that you know your transactions willnot be reversedokay so this is a bitcoin transactionfeewhich largely uh do not applyto the lightning network or they're sominimal that it's fractions of a pennythat you're payingso only do on-chain transactions hereif you need to if it's a higher amountandyou know 25 dollars a dollar fee i canhandle that i can stomach that so i'mgoing to hit confirmoh the payment expired hold on a secondhereokay so i'm going to hit confirmall right and so this sent a main chainfeewith a a main chain transaction with adollar20 fee to cover the mining fees forsecuring the bitcoin network i'm okaywith thati hit done and let's just jump over themoon hereand see what that shows up asback out okay so in moon here it saysthere's a little clock here and that'sbecause i've received anon-chain transaction for around 25 bucksof course this is calculating it insatoshi's which is uh there's a hundredmillion satoshi's in a single bitcoinbut it says it's confirming so i'mwaiting for a confirmation on thebitcoin networkwithin about 10 minutes that should bespendable from my moon walletso i was able to successfully send fundsout of my strike account three differentwaysone was to another strike user twowas to a lightning network invoiceand three was to a regular bitcoinaddressso you can interact with this manydifferent ways send and receivemany different ways now the last thing iwant to show you guysis the tip page which you can use toreceiveany amount from any person at any timewithout having tomanually request funds and this isreally really cooli utilize this i've been using this abunch in the past weekso if you just navigate down at thebottom to the right hereyour profile page you're going to seeyour profile your username and downbelow there's a little url that saysstrikedot me slash whatever your username isif you actually click on that there's apagethat can be accessed on mobile or on abrowserwhatever and this is your tip pageyou can send a tip to anybody that has astrike accountvia the lightning network or via strikevery very easily so i'll just show aquick examplelet's say i wanted to send a tip tosomebody forfive dollars and i was on their strikeuh tip pagevery simple i type in the amount i wantto sendi hit the tip button and then i getthis lightning invoice that can then besent tovery simple simply i can hit copyi'm going to jump over to moon reallyquick it's funny i'm tipping myselfum i'm

then it refreshes back to normal ifi jump back into the appi can see hey i just received a paymentfor five bucksa strike tip cool so anybody can do thisif you have a strike accountand then you can refer people to yourstriketip page strike dot me slash usernameawesome just one final note here becauseagaini've been getting a lot of differentquestions about can you use this app toactually buy and sell bitcoinand the answer is absolutely yes theflow of itwould effectively be if you have a bankaccountlinked to your strike account you fundstrike with your bank account you willthen have dollarsin strike you then simply send atransactionfrom strike to any bitcoin wallet thatyou ownbecause at that point you're takingdollars from your bank account intostrikeand it instant converts them intobitcoin and sends it to a walletthat you yourself hold so you'reeffectively buying bitcoinwith that flow and the theuh actual fees are effectively zerookay very very low on the other side
