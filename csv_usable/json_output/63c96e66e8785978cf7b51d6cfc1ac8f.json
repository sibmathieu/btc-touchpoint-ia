  "text": "What if I told you that with one click\nof one app that is already availableon your nodes app store, you could add\nhundreds of new and incredible featuresto your Bitcoin lightning network node,\nincluding the ability to use Bitcoindebit cards, the ability to distribute\nBitcoin, the ability to run a lightningnetwork jukebox and much, much more.And that if you are not already running\nthis app proficiently, you are missingout on honestly, the vast majority\nof the cool things you can do withyour Bitcoin lightning network node.Well stick around because in this\nvideo, I'm gonna walk you throughthat exact app that can do all\nof this and much, much more.Greetings everyone, Jonathan Levi.And recently, if you follow me on\nTwitter, you've seen me talk aboutthe project and collaboration that I'm\ndoing with members of the Kwa-Meyi,Sterkspruit village in South Africa.For those of you who don't know, this\nis a relatively rural village witha lot of agricultural workers, and\nmost importantly, for our purposes,They have about 50,000 people living\nin the village who are unbanked.And so we've been working together,\nmyself and a member of the village, aswell as Voltage, the cloud node provider,\nto set up a node for this community andhelp onboard as many people onto Bitcoin\nand lightning network as possible.And by the way, make sure that you are\nsubscribed if you're not already, becauseI'm gonna be sharing lots of amazing\nupdates on how you can help us in thisproject, how you can be a part of it,and of course, hopefully some incredible\nsuccess stories of lives changed.Thanks to Bitcoin and lightning network.Now, as part of that process, I recently\ngot the opportunity to sit down withBen arc, the creator of LNbits, and\nreally dive deep into this incredibleprogram that I'd really only played\nwith at a cursory level before.Now if Ben looks familiar to you,\nit's because you've probably alreadyseen his incredible videos where\nhe's developed some awesome projects,including offline lightning POS\nterminals, devices for people to be ableto use a hardware wallet for only $8.Offline Bitcoin ATMs using lightning\nnetwork and much, much more.He's really an incredible hacker and\ntinkerer, and I had no idea that theperson making these incredible devices\nsuch as hardware wallets, such astouch-to-pay, Bitcoin bolt devices, and\nall kinds of other crazy stuff,  wasthe very same person who started LNbits.So it was a huge privilege for me to be\nable to sit down with Ben for an hourand a half or more, and just pick his\nbrain, not only about all the differentfeatures that I'm gonna share today, thatfrankly I didn't understand before,\nbut also about how we can apply thesein the project that we're doing in\nKwa-Meyi, Sterkspruit and how we canhelp roll out lightning network faster\nto more people while keeping controlof the Bitcoin within the community.Now, of course, some of the features\nhere are not gonna be relevant foryou or for me, or really for anyone\nbesides the person who built them.But I think you'll find that there\nare some incredibly cool featuresthat can expand the capability\nof your lightning node, and Iwanna walk you through that app.Make sure to use the chapters below\nif you wanna skip around and seesome of the different features.Let's go ahead and dive into\nthe screencast and I will walkyou through LNbits and why\nit is so mind blowingly cool.All right.So diving into our node software, you\ncan see here, I'm running Citadel, notUmbrel, and if you haven't seen my video\non why I'll link it for you right here.The app we are talking\nabout is called LNbits.You can actually install it right from\nwithin the app store on Umbrel, on manyof the other devices such as RaspiBlitz.It can even run on a server, a clear\nweb server, and you can connect it overTor to your very own lightning node.Here you can see LNbits, and\nI've already installed it so I'mgonna go ahead and open it up.Now, one very important thing and caveat\nthat I wanna explain first is that ifyou wanna open these features app to\nother people, you will need to eitherhave a reverse proxy set up so that you\ncan make this available on the clearweb, or both LNbits and Citadel are\ncurrently developing paid services wherethey will use CloudFlare to redirect\nthe traffic so that you can use the Tor,not the clear web address, on\nyour node and direct peopleso that they can actually view\nthis on a normal web browser.Of course you could give people the\nTor address, but if you wanna make thiseasily available and accessible, like\nwe're going to be doing in the villagein South Africa, you'll probably wanna\nget this set up on the clear web.Of course you could, uh, like I said, use\nTor, but let me know in the comments belowif you're interested in a video explaining\nhow to do these reverse proxies, sothat you can make different apps on\nyour node available on the clear webwithout making the entire node available.I'd love to hear in the comments belowif that's something that\ninterests all of you.Diving back into the demo, here you\ncan see we have LNbits on Citadel,and the first thing I need to is\ngo ahead and just create a user.Okay.Now I happen to also have an admin\npassword and we are going to reallyquickly blur this so that I can log\nin, but ostensibly, what you could dohere, if you're providing this domain toanyone out there, is not give them the\nadmin password and they could just maketheir very own wallet by putting in\ntheir username here, and literally thatquick they are able, we'll blur that\nof course, that quick, they are able tocreate a wallet right on their device,\nand I will just show you really quicklyhow that works.Now, the core functionality of LNbits\nis that it allows you, as the nametells you, to break your lightning node\nup into little sub-wallets, basicallyproviding people with sub-accounts\nwithin your lightning node, andbecoming the custodian or the bank for\nthem as they use lightning network.And that's really, really cool,\nespecially if you want to give yourfamily lightning network wallets, but you\ndon't want them to custody on somethinglike BlueWallet or Wallet of Satoshi.Now, one of the first cool features\nthat I wanna show you is that you canexport this QR code to your phone and\nit gives them a wallet with full access.Now, currently I'm using\nthe Citadel dot local URL.So it is, uh, obviously not\ngoing to work on the entire web.But why don't we go ahead really\nquickly, and I'll screen record hereand show you all, obviously blurring\nthis QR code, show you all how thisworks, so I can now export this.And as you see on the screen of my\nphone, I have actually created awallet which is mobile light, mobile\nfriendly, and does everything.I mean, I can send, receive scan.This is a full functioning lightning\nnetwork wallet, and if I want to, I caneven add it as a bookmark right on my\nphone by going to, add to home screen,and now I literally have a lightning\nnetwork wallet, which is using my nodeas the infrastructure, and I can receive,\npay, it all just works that quickly.Now of course, there are other ways, I\ncan export it to a more fully functioningwallet if I want to such as BlueWallet,\nbut at the base, I mean, this is it.Like, I already have a wallet.I think that's so incredibly cool that\nyou can provide people with wallets.Now, again, this won't work because\nI'm doing it over my local network,but if you had them connect via Tor or\nyou had them connect on the clear web,that would be all, it would take for\npeople to set up a wallet on your node.Now, you might be fooled into thinking,\nokay, well, that's cool, but I don'twanna be a bank, like what's the point\nof this software, and that's exactlywhat I thought and that's why I had no\nidea just how powerful this software wasuntil I sat down with Ben, and he started\ntelling me about all of the extensions.And as you can see, there\nare a ton of extensions here.So many, that it would be an hour\nlong video to go through each andevery one of them and how they work.But I do wanna really quickly walk\nyou through each and every one ofthese, and explain what they do for\nyou and why you might wanna use them.Now, admin is, uh, just something\nthat has to do with Citadel andyou don't have to worry about it.I will note by the way that I am on\na slightly outdated version of thisapp, because I haven't updated Citadel\nand Citadel also has not yet updatedto the latest version of LNbits.So if you're watching this, most of the\nfunctionality will be the same, and Iapologize if some of it is not the same.By the way, really cool fun note,\nis that you can skin this and set updifferent skins and different looks for\npeople in their wallet, if you want to.And by the way, as I show you\nthese different apps, I want you toknow that these apps are not just\nfor you, the owner of the server.In fact, many of these things you\ncan offer as services to otherpeople who set up a user on yournode.So think about it this way, I can give\nmy kids a login here on my server, andif my kids wanna do this, they want\nto sell event tickets, or they wantto stream on Twitch and get paid, that\ncan all happen because they have accessto the features that I set for them.So as we're going through\nthis list, just remember,this is not just for you, the node owner.This can be, if you allow it, for any\nuser using your node, and that justblows my mind that I can give someone\na URL and they can set up a lightningcapable wallet that does these 50\ndifferent things I'm about to show you.Now, diving into the\nactual features themselves.Let's just go from the top to the bottom.Bleskomat allows you to create, basically\nconnect a Bitcoin ATM to LNbits, andit allows you to pay from a sub-wallet,\nmeaning you can set up a sub-walletfor that ATM, and that sub wallet on\nyour node can do the buying and sellingand commerce, if you want to set up\nyour very own Bleskomat Bitcoin ATM.And again, Ben has some really amazing\nstuff that he has done for opensourcinghardware around Bitcoin ATMs.The Discord Bot allows you to generate\nusers and wallets by lightning network.So people can pay to set up their\nusername and they can also usediscord and set up wallets, I think.I'm not a big Discord user,\nbut really, really cool.DJ Livestream allows you if you're\ndoing a live stream of music and DJingon the internet, for people to pay\nand download that livestream rightaway, automatically, which is cool.Again, let me remind you, a lot of these\nare not gonna be relevant to everyone,but some of them like the ones coming up\ntowards the end are really freaking cool.Events allows you to literally sell\nevents and check people into thoseevents, all over lightning network.It allows you to generate an invoice\nwhere people can pay for the event.You can set up different events on\nyour server, and people can actuallygenerate those events, charge people\nand check them in with a QR code.Hivemind.Right now, as far as I was told is just a\nplaceholder, it's not gonna work until BIP300, so check back when that comes out.Invoices is not what you would think,\nit is not lightning network invoices.It actually allows people to create a\nreal invoice, like an old fashioned paperinvoice that pays into their wallet,and we can configure it, put\nin all the different namesand whatever we want to do.And this is cool if you're running\na brick and mortar business, andit will generate an invoice, jelly\nbeans for $1, and it will create aninvoice that I can then print out and\nhand to someone, which is so cool.There's the invoice.Someone can pay the invoice,\nand it will pay directly intothe sub-wallet on my node.That's a really cool thing to be able\nto provide to your family members orfriends or local businesses if you\nwant them to support lightning network.Let's go on to Lightning Addresses.Now, I've previously done a video\non lightning addresses and how youcan set them up quickly and easily,but what's cool here is you can actually\nsell lightning addresses for your domain.So let's say you manage to buy a\nreally, really cool domain, like pay.meor something like that, this service\nwill actually allow you to sell peoplelightning addresses, it handles all the\npayments, it handles all the setup, andthey can set that up in such a way that\nthey actually deposit into your lightningaddress on your node, which is so cool.Right?LndHub is another really cool feature.It allows you to access your LNbits wallet\nfrom BlueWallet or Zeus, if you prefer theuser experience there, you can do that.Now here's another one that I did\nnot understand at all and had tohave explained to me, LNURLDevice is\nbasically an app that allows you tocreate offline lightning network devices,\nsuch as physical cash registers, pointof sales, ATMs, or whatever else,and those use an offline system\nof verification pins that youknow, and which basically you're\npiggybacking off the person's device.So they pay or they deposit, and\nthey give you a word and you knowwhat the word should be based on\nthe list that you've printed out,and basically without internet, you\nhave made a way to do a lightningnetwork ATM point of sale or whatever.Now, this is gonna be totally\ntransformational for the folksin Kwa-Meyi, Sterkspruit.Although they have mobile internet and\nsmartphones, sometimes that can be spotty,sometimes internet's not available,  and\njust imagine that they can go and theycan sell their wares at the market and\nnot even need internet access to do it.By the way, one of those features that\nI don't yet have, but which has alreadybeen released and will be updated\nsoon is the bolt card extension, whichliterally allows you to make your very\nown bolt credit card, a tap-to-pay NFCcredit card with limitations on it.All you need is an NFC\nchip and your phone.And if you wanna see me do a video\nwhere I create a 3D printed creditcard of my own and pay with it, let\nme know in the comments below, becauseI've been working on doing it, I just\ndon't know if anyone is interested inseeing it, but the feature has been\nadded to LNbits, it is called Bolt.Another one that I didn't\nreally fully understand,and I had to re-record this part of\nthe video a few times is LNURL Pay.LNURL Pay is very, very simple.It's like a lightning address.It allows you to put up a QR\ncode, but for lightning network.So one of the complaints that people have\nabout lightning is that it's a little moreconfusing to have to generate an invoice,as opposed to onchain transactions where\nI can just post a QR code and someonecan pay me, albeit that is a really\nbad way to do it because of privacy.While LNURL Pay gives a QR code\nthat you can put up near the cashregister, put it on your shirt, put\nit on your business card, whateveryou want, and it will allow people\nto pay that link whenever they want,and you can specify different, uh,\namounts, or you can just say, hey,here's my LNURL Pay scan this, you\ncould even embed it on your videosif you're a YouTuber, on your social\nmedia, and people can pay you by justscanning a QR code, which is really,\nreally cool and an awesome feature tohave set up so easily on your node.And what's also cool is because this\nis done on sub-accounts, you can seehow much different sources or different\nplaces, for example, if you put one onyour YouTube, one on your social media,\none in your storefront, you can actuallysee which wallet they're coming into and\ntrack where the payments are coming from.All right.Let's talk about LNURL Withdraw because\nthese are a little bit confusing,but they are so freaking cool.So LNURL Withdraw basically allows\nsomeone with a QR code or a string ofinformation to withdraw from your wallet.Now you might say, well,\nwhy would I wanna do that?Why would I wanna allow\nsomeone to do that?Well, first, if you have an app and\nyou wanna allow people to withdrawfrom your app, that's really cool.But also imagine a scenario in where you\nwant to reward people for doing something.For example, every person who comes\ninto my store today will get athousand Satoshis, and all you have\nto do is put that QR code up andthey can then withdraw that amount.Now, I know what you're thinking.What, what limits are there here so\nthat I don't lose a lot of money?They can specify frequency, how\nmany times each person can useit, how often it can be used.So you can say it can only be\nused once every five minutes.You can specify an upper limit,\na number of times per day.So there are, even a total amount if\nyou want, and obviously this goes into asub-wallet, so that's another way to put\ncontrols and checks and balances here.So there are tons of ways that you can\nlimit this, but it's really, reallycool that you could print out vouchers\nfor people or give people your businesscard and say, hey, scan this and you'll\nget a thousand Satoshis or 10 Satoshis.You could put this on your livestream\nand say, thanks for tuning in,here's a bunch of Satoshis.Really, really cool stuff.Really, really cool way to, uh,\nget people using lightning network.Another cool thing that you could\ndo with LNURL Withdraw is say thateach person can only claim their\ncode once a month or once a year,and that's a really cool way to\nreward people for doing something ormaybe incentivize certain behaviors.All right.Offline shop.Really interesting is a cool\nway for people to receivepayments for products offline.It kind of works similar to the offline\ndevice that I mentioned before, butoffline shop literally allows you to\nhave a system where people can pay, andbecause you know the code that's supposed\nto be generated and the word that's gonnabe generated if they make a successful\npayment with just a piece of paper,you can validate that payment was made,and that is just so cool, and that\nis gonna be such a transformationalfeature for this project we're doing.Onchain wallet.If you want people to be able to pay you\nonchain in the features that I'm gonnaexplain a little later, such as TPOs, you\ncan do that and you can add your onchainwallet's xPub, meaning the public key,you can even sync it with your\nhardware device or your $8 hardwaredevice that Ben has created, and it\nwill allow in the point of sale forpeople to choose similar to BTCPay,\nbut a lot lighter and a lot simpler.It'll allow people to choose\nlightning network or onchainand then pay you onchain.That might not make sense yet, but when\nwe get to the TPOs, it'll all make sense.Paywall, really, really cool.You can post a link and people\nhave to pay in order to getredirected to a link of content.If I wanted to, and I weren't doing\nYouTube memberships, which by the way,make sure to check out below because\nit helps support the channel and you'llget exclusive access, early access\nto content, the ability to influencethe videos that I make next and more.But if I weren't doing that, I could\ncreate a Paywall and people would haveto pay a certain amount of Satoshis\nto be redirected and find the link.Really cool.Sats Dice is pretty much\nwhat you would think.It's the ability to offer gambling\nwith odds that you can configure,however you want, right on your node,and people can earn Sats.It's basically you're running a\ngambling ring right on your node.SatsPay Server.Okay, this is another one that\nI totally did not understand,but basically it's like BTCPay.It allows you to generate an invoice\nfor people quickly and easily.If you're on the go or you're just\nsitting at your store and you want peopleto be able to pay you, you can create\na new charge such as sweet potatoes.And this is again, similar to the invoice,\nbut it's just, you can host it right thereand it's connected to the internet, unlike\nthe invoice, which is more of a PDF deal.Set it up, say a mil, uh,\nyou know, a thousand Sats.You can connect it to a webhook, so it\ncan connect to your Zapier or whatever.Completed button URL can\nredirect, completed button text,and you can even allow onchain,as I demonstrated before, you can\nset it up so that people have theoption, if you connect your xPub for\npaying you onchain, let's do that.And you can create a charge and you\ncan now share that link with someoneand allow them to pay you, and they\ncan pay right here on this hosted page.It's just a much easier way to give\nsomeone a clear understanding of whatthey're paying without setting up a\nheavy BTCPay installation which, I loveBTCPay, but it is a little heavy, uh,\nand a little kind of intense to set up.Scrub.All right, Scrub, really interesting.Scrub stands for self-custodial\nremittance something.And what Scrub does is allow you\nthat any payment that comes intoyour LNbits wallet can automatically\nbe redirected to your other wallet.So say, uh, you wanna redirect it to\nWallet of Satoshi or say, for example,uh, you have your own node and you're\njust using someone else's LNbits,I don't know why you would do that,\nbut you can do it, this allows youto automatically pull the payments\nand push them right out into theother wallet of your choosing.Split Payments is pretty cool.It allows you to split incoming\npayments across wallets.So if you have some business\npartners in your store or yourjuice stand or whatever, you can\nautomatically split the paymentsso they go into different\nwallets, right within LNbits.Really, really cool.You could also offer services where you\ntake a 1% fee, uh, if people get paid.Kind of a neat thing, uh, to set up and\nreally, really cool ways of, you know.If you wanna pay all your kids\nequally, then you could set up onewallet, pay their allowance to that\none wallet, and it would split equallyto all their different wallets.Really cool.Spotify Jukebox is exactly\nwhat you would think.It's a jukebox that runs on Spotify and\npeople can pay in lightening network toselect their song instead of old school,\nquarters and coins who uses these anymore.This was originally set up for bars\nthat are running the node locally, butyou could set this up as a livestream,if you're live streaming on Twitch,\nand people could pay to choosethe song that's gonna be on next,\nand I think that's really awesome.Stream Alerts is a little bit of\nan outdated one, which has to dowith people paying you on Twitch.Ben wasn't sure if it works or not, so\ndon't worry about that because we haveStreamer Copilot and Streamer Copilot\nallows you to create QR codes, embedthose QR codes right into livestreams,and when someone pays that QR code it does\na cool little animation on this screen.I'm gonna try that out pretty soon.Let me know when the comments below if\nyou'd like to see me do a livestreamwhere I try this out, and we see\nhow it actually works 'cause I thinkthat is so cool to be able to have\nan automated, this stuff is so coolyou guys.Subdomains.All right.We talked about selling lightning\naddresses, what about sellingsubdomains of your domain?Let's say you have a\nreally, really cool domain.You wanna sell subdomains\nfor it, you can do that here.I think most of you are probably not\ngonna be in the domain selling business,but it's pretty cool to be able to\nsell subdomains on your domain if youhave a really, really cool domain.Support Tickets is exactly\nwhat you would think.It allows you to set up a full-fledged\nsupport ticket system on your node,and people can pay in lightning\nif they wanna submit a ticket.Really awesome.Tip Jar.All right.This is the one that I think most of you\nare going, gonna want to use the most.Tip Jar enables you to accept Bitcoin\ntips very, very easily unlike some ofthe other solutions that are out there.Uh, and if people don't know how to\nuse a lightning address or their walletdoesn't support lightning address,\nthis is gonna be a whole lot easier.You can select the wallet that you want.You can allow chain if you want, and\ndonatee name we can just put this, andthe webhook URL if you wanna send it\nto a Zapier or IFTTT, and that's it.You can create that Tip Jar, and that\nis set up and you can send this link topeople, put it on your website, put it\nin your social media, people click it,and what's cool about this, that\nlightning address doesn't alwaysoffer or usually doesn't offer, is\npeople can give it a message here.I love getting all of your lightning\nnetwork tips, but I don't know whothey're from and I don't know why\nyou're sending it to me most of thetime, unless you send it on Alby.So it's really cool to be able to give\npeople this link, and I think once Ihave this set up on the clear web I'm\njust gonna give this link, 'cause I wannaknow who to thank in the next video.So, uh, if you do tip me, you can\ntip me on Alby and if you say who youare, well, thank you and I will do my\nbest to thank you on the social media.All right.Oh my God.This video is getting really, really long.I'm sorry.I hope you're skipping with the\nchapters below, but let's keep going.Almost done here.And we're getting to the, what I think is\nreally the coolest one, and this is TPoS.It is a shareable point of sale\nterminal that anyone and everyone whohas a account on your node can use.It's kind of like Breeze or\neven BTCPay has a POS terminal,point of sale terminal,but this is like dead simple\nand really, really easy.I can set up a new TPoS\nright, and let's just say,Kwa-Meyi Sterkspruit, I'm quite\nsure I'm misspelling that.I'm sorry guys.And the wallet, we can select any\nof the wallets that we've set up.I only have this one wallet, let's\nsay USD, and the tip wallet ifthey wanna leave a tip, and we\ncan put the options 5%, 10%, 20%,whatever, and we create that TPoS.And now this is a hosted\nPOS that I can pop up,like if I'm a store I can use\nthis on the local network.I don't even need to\nconnect to the clear web.I don't need to use Tor.And this is it, this is my cash register.I can even make it pretty, style\nit like this, and this is it.I mean, I can put in an amount, I need\n3,500 or let's say $3.50, hit okay,and that's it.Now, you all see this\nlittle icon down here?Really cool, right?That icon is NFC, and NFC will work if\nyou are using this wallet on a smartdevice, such as your iPhone or Android.So switching over here and recording\nthe screen, you can see how.All I have to do, if I want to become a\nlightning-friendly merchant, is I go here,I go to my TPoS,and just like that, without downloading\nan app, without setting anythingup, without running my own node,\nI can set up a POS just like this.I have it.Here's my TPoS.And watch this, $25.It gives me the invoice.And now if someone has, apparently the\nNFC isn't working on my iPhone, butif someone has a lightning credit card\nor they have an NFC-enabled wallet orsmartphone, we can just tap to pay,and that's it.Of course we could scan the QR code, old\nschool style, and that works, but on manydevices and I think on Android, I think\nmy iPhone's just not allowing permissionto the NFC chip,  you can actually have\ntapped to pay between people on your node.So those are the many,\nmany features of LNbits.I really hope I didn't lose you\nguys along the way on this video.I would love to know in the comments\nbelow, what features do you think aregonna be the most impactful for you?What features would you like to see?I'm sure that the LNbits team is going\nto see this video and read the comments.And I wanna remind you of courseto like and subscribe.Still about 70% of you are not subscribed\nto this channel, and it really doesmake a huge difference if you really\nwanna support the channel, and youwanna see me make even more videos, go\nahead and check out our memberships soyou can get access to exclusive content\nand direct access to me for problemsolving, troubleshooting, and more.Thanks for watching, and\nI'll see you guys next time.",
