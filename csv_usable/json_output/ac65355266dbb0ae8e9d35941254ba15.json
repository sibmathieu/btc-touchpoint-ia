  "text": "every year the human rights Foundationhosts the Oslo Freedom Forum an eventfor human rights activists from all overthe world this may in Norway I had thepleasure of sitting down with Gigi Gigiis a bitcoiner and software engineer whowrites words and code for Bitcoin hisfirst book 21 lessons is one of the mostrecommended books among bitcoiners he'slaunched various projects in the Bitcoinspace and is now currently working onhis second book 21 ways his main focusis on privacy security free software andeducation[Music]when you think about freedomwhat does that mean to youwell that's a good question too start itoff I thinkI think if you don't have any freedomyou will notice it immediately and withwe take so manythings for granted and I thinkfirst of allit doesn't mean that you're absolutelyfree to do what you want you know likeyou're you should be free to go on akilling spree without consequences butI think in general you should be free tothink what you want and free to say whatyou want and alsowithin reason free to do what you wantyou know like there is this saying myfreedom to swing my arm and set yourface basicallyso yeah I think when I think aboutfreedom Ithink mostly aboutall the important rights that we landedon you know like freedom of speechfreedom of movement andyou know also freedom tokind of construct your life as you seefit as you wish so that would be oneanswer I guessdo you feel that there is a disconnectbetween people maybe that live inWestern countries that are more freeversus other countries where uh theymight have authoritarian governments orbe living less free worldoh I mean definitely I think most peopleare not aware especially if you'reliving in a more or less free country inin one of the Western countriesmost people are not aware how bad it isaround the world and how unfree somepeople are and like how some of theregimes function and I mean we're hereat the freedom forum andum just listen to those kind of storiesand the various Health that people wentthrough and you will understand veryvery quicklyand I always like the kind of there area couple of tests that will immediatelyopen your eyes to how free you are oryou aren't for example are you free tomake fun of the leader of your countryand there are some countries where youjust can't do that because you you'llyou'll immediately land in jail or worseandI think a lot of people in the westdon't realize this that this is realityfor a lot of people that you you can'teven make fun of someone like your lifewill be in danger if you make fun of thewrong person so to speakso I mean you do a lot of work in theeducation space both in Bitcoin freedomand privacyhow do you go aboutreasoning with people or helping themunderstand you know the lack of Freedomthat other people might be going throughlike how do you get them to really feelthatI I always try tokind of Start From First principlesand and reason up from there and it'sfor examplewith freedom of speechit's the only thing that we have tocourse correct our society tofigure out what we are doing wrong andtryingto fix that and trying to do it betteronce you start centering people once youcan't say certain things or talk aboutcertain things or certain people certainsituations certain Conceptsthen you're already down a very weirdand dark path becausethere is no other way tofixing things and cost correctingall our actions without talking about itand without being able to talk about itand figuring out the best wayand in the end we only have likeas aas a con like humans are networkedbeings and as like a network organismthe only way we haveis by talking about things and trying tofigure stuff out there's either that orimmediately you land on violence if youif you cannottalk it through and reason about it andfind the best solution that everyone iswilling to work towards voluntarily youimmediately like the only other optionthat you have is violence so it's it'seither freedom of speech or violenceand like that's a kind of firstprinciple of first principles approachto make people understand how importantthis is like most people don't thinkabout these things properly like theythey're like uh you can't say thatbecause people will get offended and solike that's not that's not what this isabout freedom of speech is not aboutoffending people it's not about beingable to say stuff to offend someonethat's like a byproduct that's somethingthat we need to deal with that'ssomething that you know likeyou we are weI love to take the risk to beingoffended because everything else wouldbe worse you know like silencing speechis way worse and yeah I think we have tothink about those things properly anddeeply because we went through all thosekind of various Hells before I mean justtake a glance at history and you willseehow bad things truly can get once youremove these freedoms and and theserights that are enshrined in the variousdocuments that we drafted over you knowhundreds and thousands of years and Imean we still have places whereum you know like you don't even have tolook at history you just have to look atI mean look at China for example youknow it's even though it's it's it's avery prosperous country over over thelastum you know decades they did very welleconomically in some regards but it'snot a very free country and you don'thave to kind ofyou know look for long toto see what happens and what kind ofauthoritarian regimes and housecapesopen up if you remove basic freedomslike freedom of speech and so ondo you think you can have freedomwithout privacynojust straight up now straight up now youneed you need the freedom you need toyou need at least the privacy of yourown home so that you can think what youwant and say what you want and discussthings that are currently off topiclike that um by off topic I mean thatare basically outside of the Overtonwindow like every every Revolution wasalways you knowum by definitioneverything that improves societiesoutside of the norm it was always it'sit's forbidden to talk about this it'sit's kind of you know even forbidden tothink those things just think about theGutenberg Revolution think about youknow like abolishing slavery you needyou need the privacy of your own home tomeet with someone else and discuss thosethings and and talk you through it eveneven for yourself you need the privacyof your own home at least to thinkthrough things by yourself to writeabout things for example and so on likewriting writing as far as I'm concernedis thinking about things properlyand so I don't think there's any freedomwithout privacybasically another way of saying the samething is that surveillance makes allother freedoms useless and you canimmediately tell thisjust by you know watch it people I meaneveryone knows this you know what shouldpeople at how they be how they behave ifthey think they're not being surveilledand then you tell them or you show themthat there was a camera or or somethingall along they immediately changed theirbehavior Everything Changesso yeahagain surveillance makes all otherfreedoms useless I mean we're seeingsurveillance grow throughout the worldas especially as we move to a moreDigital World a lot of times that is isby actual people choosing to besurveilled for a convenience uhadvantage and a lot of times it's forgovernments doing it we see kids beingborn into surveillanceis this something that concerns you isthis something that should concerneverybodyyeah it definitely concerns meumI think what what every what everyoneshould thinkum long and Hardy bodies these systemsonce they are builtbad people can take over almostimmediately very easily like oftentimesthese these systems like these thesesystems of convenience and surveillanceand so onI mean we see it with automated passportcontrol those kind of things you knowit's it's it's it's all it's all fineand it's all very convenientif you actually like and agree with thepeople in power that are controlling thesystem and that are currently in chargeof building these systems out and so onbut I mean again one quick glance athistory and you can see how quicklythings change and suddenly you have aninsane dictator in power and he hasaccess to those kind of systems and thenthings can getreally really bad really quickly and Ithink everyone that's why everyoneshould be concerned and also whyeveryone should kind oftake incremental steps ofincreasing their privacy and their likedata footprint and those kind of thingsI think it is just proper digitalhygiene that's that's one thing likethat's one way to think about itand I think it willbe increasingly important depending onyour situation and like where you livewhat you're doing what kind ofsituations you're presented withum yeah I think everyone will have tocare about this in one way or or anotherum I thinkthat's thethat's the world we're living incurrently andyou will be faced with a situation whereyou probablywish that you had more privacy or whereyou're forced to do things privatelylike if you have to flee your countryfor example those kind of things thenyeah you need to take care of thosethings otherwise your life will be indanger and I mean againjust look at how all the cases that arepresented here at the Oslo Freedom Forumthere are people dissidents andjournalists and people in really badsituations they need tolikeeven even when you're when you'respeaking up you need you need to havethe option to be private and to use apseudonym and be anonymous andum write about the people in power in away where you cannot be immediatelysquashed for example and so on so Ithink that's all of that is veryimportantI mean similar to me you are a publicfigure that advocates for privacyI often hear people say that it's it'shypocritical to do that that you can'tbe both public and be Pro privacyhow do you battle with that balance wellumI think it's kind of a spectrum how muchyou want tolet the public know about you and againprivacy is not secrecyit's privacy is about selectivelyrevealing yourself to the worldyou know to quote Eric Hughes andthat's exactly right like many peopleknow many things about me but it justkind of you knowit should it shouldn't be it should beharder than like 10 seconds on Google orwhatever search engine engine you'reusingto find out exactlyall of your past where you're currentlyliving and what you're up to and so on Ibelieve and that's kind of my goal in inshowing that that this is also possiblelike you can actuallyyou can be private online if you want tobe and I I also I want to normalizeprivacy I want to normalizeum pseudonyms as wellI I mean I I love how this wascompletely normal and still is in thegaming world for example like you don'tlike your name you spin up a new one youdon't like your name you don't like youravatar you change itand of course you know like this hangstogether with identity and reputationand so on and like all these things arecurrently being figured out but I don'tthink thata Facebook world is a nice world to livelive in where you have one identity andone image that defines you and one namethat defines you and one kind ofoccupation this is what you do and so onlike identityis always was and always will bePrismatic you are multiple people in onelike at church you're a different kindof person than you are at the at yourlike soccer club or what have you likeyou're a different kind of person at thebar thanum like you know like you are on yourjob depending depending what you do ofcourse and those kind of things areimportant and you cannotyou cannot kind oflike in in the Facebook world they wantyou to to believe that you only havethis kind of identity and you use it forabsolutely everything and you're you'rekind of the identity thatyour government gives you is notnecessarily your identity like it's Iknow many people thatwhere I I don't even know their realnames you know I don't even know thetrue names I don't I don't know theirtheir government names I know theirnames and I know those people very verywell and I've been knowing them likeI've known them for many many years andI consider them my friends and I thinkall of this should be normalized kind oflike we we don'twe shouldn'twe shouldn't take steps towards buildingan insane panopticon we should we shouldtake steps to move away from this worldI believe but isn't the panopticonalready built well to some extent yesbutI think more like I'm I'm in generaloptimistic I'm I would consider myselfan optimist even though I know how badthings arebut I think people are currently wakingup howhow bad it actually is I meanwe saw whole countriesbeing completely the platformed from thebanking system for example like withwith the click of a button and I I thinkwe will seeI was I think we will see this um thinkthings these things will happen morefrequently as it is easier to do this itwill happen more frequently sothe panopticon is built in part but it'snot complete yet not everything isabsolutely connected like there arestill somethere's still some friction if youactually want toI don't know the platform D platform uhcertain religious group from allsocietal services for example you cannotdo this with one push of the buttoncurrently worldwide definitely notand I thinkwe need to realize as a society thatthis is probably not a world we want tolive in we don't we should not continueto build up those systems and we shouldtake steps totear down the existing systems and fightagainst this like also speak out andalso use technology that allows you toprotect yourself use encryptiontechnologydon't give away your private informationdon't give away any unnecessaryinformation about yourself and yeahI have an optimistic Outlook about it Ithink people will learn the more peoplelike the more people and the morecountries and the more like groups ofpeople will get per will get burned theeasier it will be tolearn these things for them is that whatgives you hope that people will getburned and then they will learnno actually not I think in generalpeople are not stupidthat's what gives me hopeI don't believe in the stupid messes youknow masses can be be stupid and canbehave in Stupid Ways and so on but Ithink individuals are really smart and II view groups of people as just a bunchof individuals and they will figure itout and they will they will decide forthemselves what is importantand again I thinkpeople will realize that these kind ofthings are increasingly important I meanwe we see this you're you'reself-censoring and you're beingde-platformed everywhere Twitter is agreat example you know like you can'tsay certain things you'll be bannedimmediately like you'll you'll be inTwitter jail and so on and I think thereisa counter movement happening and peopleare kind of realizing how important itis to have open conversations forexample and to havefreedom of speech and freedom of thoughtandit's really important that you are ableto say what you think even if this thingis stupid everyone is stupid from timeto time we should be allowed to saywrong things and stupid things andoffensive thingsand I thinkwe've learned this the hard way so manytimesI hope that we don't have to learn itthe hard way again butwell again I'm an optimist we might haveto learn it the hard way again I hopenot I really hope notwell anyway GG you can't really seethrough your pillowcase butwe just had a Ukrainian protest walkthroughum I guess a pro-ukrainian protest uhwith the war going onum so obviously apologies to to you andall the listeners if if that got pickedupum yeah but that's a perfect example youneed to beyou need to be free to protest forexample that's that's another thingthat's super important like you knowthese are the kinds of freedoms we aretalking about and and in part likethat's a that's also a great examplefrom the Privacy privacy side of thingslike I encourage people to go protestingbut maybe think about what you bringwith you like if you have your mobilephone which is a live tracking devicewith you depending on your situationdepending on the government depending onthe protest it might be wiser to leavethe phone at home and yeah not build upa history that tracks you and yourlocation and that you have been at theprotest and so on and I mean we saw thisin Hong Kong and so on where people gotburned by this right I mean we saw it inAmerica too they were using it during abunch of protests in America they weretracking cell phones yeahwhat umwhat would you say to so when I talk topeople about privacy a lot of times whatI hear isI'm already completely a part of thesurveillance state right like I useFacebook I use Instagram I use all thesocial mediaI'm I'm already completely screwedthere's nothing I can do about it whatdo you tell those people there's alsothere's always something you can do andyou don't have to do it all at once I Iknow it can be very overwhelming and butyou have to take small steps in theright direction that's the only way todo it and yeah that might be true butyou can start by deleting your Facebooklike I can tell you your quality yourquality of life will improve but itdepends on your situation of course youknow like for some people Facebook isthe internet but it's you know like dodo youagain it every every situation isdifferent for every individual it willbe different but you you're free forexample to build up a second Personapseudonym if you want to do reporting ifyou want to write something if you wantto for example also publish a bookthere's a reason why authors have pennames you know there's a reason for thatand also you know of course in the musicindustry and so there are many peoplethat that use like different names asartists as their legal name and thereare reasons for that and you can do thatyou can reduce the the footprint of yourlegal identity and use a differentidentity you can also like switchecosystems and use for example softwarethat respects your privacy and softwarethat respects your rights and of coursethere's a free software movement that isall about that where you're free to useyour compute as you wish you're not theslave of your of your computer you'renot the slave of the system like if youhave a Facebook account you're the slavefor Facebook they can do what they wantthey can delete their account they candelete your posts and so on and thereare other there are other systems andother ways of doing things where thiscan never happen because you're incontrol and you're in charge and withthe money for example Bitcoin is theperfect example if you use Bitcoinproperly no one can debank you no onecan the platform you your account can'tbe frozen your transactions can't becanceled like if you know how to do thisand how to use it properly that's a stepin the right direction then you are youhave you're Sovereign when it comes toyour finances and you can take smallbaby steps likeyour note-taking app does it need tosurveil you do you need to use theGoogle note-taking app I don't think sothere are other there are other appsthat are really good standard nodeswould be one of them there are plentyothers and so just try to use encryptionby default try to use Messengers thatare open source and that have strongencryption built in those kind of thingsand you can you can do this in astep-by-step fashion like you don't haveto do itall at once and do it right from day onethat's impossible you have to learn youhave to adapt and you can again reducethe size of yourof your footprint of your onlinefootprint and you canyeah start to take care of your digitalhygiene it's very much like you knowstarting to work out and eating healthyit's like step by step little stepsevery single day and before you know ityou will before you know it thisargument completely Falls flat becausesuddenly you are more privatesuddenly you're not you did not giveeverything away you knowandyour life can also change like it mightbe true that some entity or somegovernment has all the information aboutyou now but you know like where you livecan change where you work can changeyour name can change your situation canchangeand you can change too and you can youcan learn to do this and you can learnto use use the tools as they say it'snot impossible I did it too I'm still inthe process I'm still trying to do thisin a better way and I'm learning everyday and I think that's the only way todo itso you didn't alwayshave conversations with the pillowcaseover your face no not always I also Iusually wear a green suit butunfortunately I didn't bring it so thisis like the poor man's screen suit wemade it work we made it work Iappreciate your privacyumyou know so I mean I'm obviously doing ashowthis showabout privacy and freedomand my face is being shownwhat do you think of that am I a dumbassI don't think you're a dumbassyou can also shave your beard and no onewill recognize you anymoreit's I mean magicians will tell you thatlike you you would you would like besurprised huh what a fake mustache andthe hat can do you know like peoplewon't recognize you anymore and I thinkpeople like we we kind of moved awayfrom a culture where this was more thenorm you know everyone wearing a trenchcoat and the hat and sunglasses and justeveryone kind of it was very easy toblend into a crowd and those kind ofthingsand currently you know like it'severyone is taking selfies all the timeand of course you know like that notthat there's anything wrong with thatbut it's just we we live in a in a bitof a different culture now and peopledon't realize how likeeven if you're a public Persona I meanthat's that's true for like very publicpeople as well there are ways to walkdown the street without you know peoplerecognizing you immediately soyou can do that Mattget a nice big hat nice big sunglasseswhat do you think about children cominginto this world right nowmore children like first first andforemostbut specifically this idea of thisbalance betweendigital all-encompassing surveillanceand being prepared for a digital worldat the same time hmmI meanI think the parents should be kind ofat least not completely careless in inthe sense thatum you know messing up your kids privacyfrom the get-goum I also think it I feel like itchanged a little bit maybe it's just forme maybe I'm very biased in that regardbut but I feel like it it used to bethat everyone was broadcasting all theinformation all the time just you knowlike posting it on Facebook andInstagram and so on and like how we useInstagram for example changed and how weuse Facebook change and now I feel likeit's more directed it's more like peopleusemore private channels like sending picsof the kids on WhatsApp to certaingroups and so on I I feel like you knowas a society we are kind of figuring outhow to how how to do this in a waysharing pictures and so on that's notcompletely insane you know like justputting it online for absolutelyeveryone to see like this changed overthe last 10 15 years alreadyand so I don't think that all is lostbut you know there are alsothey're veryfrightening developments kind of fromthe Privacy perspective in the EuropeanUnion for example they want to installspyware on all your devices that scanyour pictures and your texts before theyever get encrypted before they are evensent out so every time you snap apicture it'sscant andpeople should just be aware of that andthose are not great developments to putit mildlyumbut yeah it's it's kind of trickybecause we are living in thisI mean we're all digital Natives and thekids definitely are and soI don't think not usinga smartphone for example is an option II think youyou kind of have toyou have to learn how to use thosethings andumyou know I think a good idea Adam Careytalked about this as well um thatif you have kids try toteach them about the technology and showthem that there are other things as wellyou know like show them what Linux isset up a Linux sister and play aroundwith that and like flash a different OSon a smartphone and let them you knowlearn those kind of things and and playaround with it kids love this stuff Imean they love technology and justtinkering with stuff and figuringfiguring shit out and so I'm not I'm nottoo worried about it butagain I think as parentsI hope thatmore and more parents are more carefulwithum how they are handlinglike the the digital traces that the thethe digital breadcrumbs that they leaveall over the place you think there'sgonna be like a bit of a reckoning inthat regard as these kids get olderbecause this is the first generationthat really has had has grown up withsocial media that has grown up withyou know maybe listening devices intheir house whether that's Amazon orGoogle or whatnothmm that's a good question I don't knowI think in general the kids will be allright you know I grew up playingcomputer games violent ones quoteunquote like stuff like Doom at DukeNukem and so on and according to themainstream media at the time and thatwas a prevailing view for like 10 yearsplus that if you if you play this forlikemultiple hours a day you'll be a serialkiller you know and it turns out notevery gamer turned into a serial killerit's just something that gaming gotintegrated into society completely likeit's completely normal now I I stillremember a time where it absolutelywasn't you were a complete weirdo if youwere playing computer gamesand so I mean I'm still kind of a weirdoso that's that but it'sagain I think it will be fine I thinkthe kids will be all right and and theywill they will also learnI think they will learn how to handlethose kind of things and also the theecosystems that are currently worryingus I think they they will find a wayaround it kind of they they'll figure itoutso we met in the Bitcoin worldwe dida bunch of years ago you obviously arevery focused on bitcoin why is Bitcoinimportantoh I think Bitcoin is the most importantthing that's currently happeningperiod but especially if you care aboutfreedomBitcoin is insanely important like allall theall the people that are on a power tripand want to build authoritarian systemsand want to build the panopticons and soonthey can do this easily because in myopinion the money is broken and you canFinance this very easilyif we were on a Bitcoin standard alreadyit would be very hard to finance thosethings that's that's one reason whyBitcoin is important same is true forwar Samsung like it's very easy tofinance those things currently with thethe way the monetary system is set upand I thinkI think Bitcoin isthe return to a more sane and soundworldthat's my hope at leastand in the freedom realm again like ifyou use Bitcoin properlyno one no one can de-platform you no onecan cancel you no one can freeze youraccount no one can forcefully take theBitcoin away from you like at least notremotely you know like it'sit's like a gold coin that you have inyour pocket it can be stolen like if ifyouif you find the person and so on butthat's alsonot entirely true because Bitcoin what Ilove about Bitcoin is it's justinformation it has no physical body soto speakthat's why you can't have Bitcoin inyour head and you can literally haveBitcoin in your head and I mean everyBitcoin knows this but I feel like wedon't talk about this fact often enoughyou can have 12 words in your headand you can have all your wealth allyour possessions stored in these 12words in your head and you can getstripped naked and run all run acrossthe board and there's nothing anyone cando about it and if you if you make itback to safetyyou can enter these 12 words into like ahardware wallet or something and youhave access to all your wealth and it'sintactand that's very powerful and that's veryimportant for Freedom that's we we needtools like this that empower theindividual again and put the individualat the center and that's what Bitcoindoeswhen you think about Bitcoinwhat is your do you have any concernswith the current state of Bitcoin whatis your biggest concern huhapathyapathy that people don't caredo people caremore and more people care and that'svery good to see I think you know as theas the Fiat system the traditionalmonetary systemI think it's currently breaking down andat this as this increasesthe problems will increase and more andmore people will be waking up to thefact that Bitcoin is a viablealternative and the sound moneyalternative and something that you canjust use and you will always have accessto and no one can take it everywherefrom you Bitcoin will always be therefor you that's people that like peopledon't realize how profound this is youknow in that sense it's like gold youknow like gold will always be there foryou if you want to use it it doesn't goaway you know gold doesn't react toanything else it's you can't destroygold basically you I think you alsocan't destroy Bitcoin it's the same itwill the Bitcoin network will always bethere for you and what's also sopowerful like if if you're a dissidentfor example or journalists or what haveyou and you need to receive fundsall you need to do is to lock yourselfin the bathroom or something someprivate place and flip a coin a coupleof times and then you have a Bitcoinwallet it's just some math after thatbut you just need a large random numberand you can flip a coin 265 times andyou will have a valid Bitcoin walletthat's all you need to do that's that'swhy they call it permissionless youdon't need permission to do that youcan't just do thatand you will always be able to do thatand that's why Bitcoin is so powerfulyou can actually do this you can you canbe in the prison prison cell and do thisyou just need a way to communicate theoutput of this like the large number youdo some math and then you have a Bitcoinaddress and the Bitcoin address you canput anywhere you can put it on yourTwitter profile and so on and of courseyou know like currently Bitcoin is stillyoung like there are some privacyimplications with address reuse and soon I I don't think we need to get intothis this all of this is currently beingfigured out you know the example Ialways like to give forfor those kind ofshortcomings of the technology currentlyif you will it's like it it took us 30years to transition from a plain textinternet HTTP to httpsthat took us 30 years and it took ittook also on a societal level likepeople didn't carecryptographers cared but people didn'tit took someone like Edward Snowden toshow the people why this is importantwhy we needencryption online if everything is inplain text that's a really bad idea youknow for example with the internetand yeah we it took a long time for forus to really take this seriously andfigure it out and I don't think it willtake as long as as a time with withBitcoin I think people will figure outquickly quickerhow important Bitcoin is because moneyis kind of the most important thing inwhen it comes to your survivalit's really really hard to survive ifyou have zero money or the money breaksdownand soyeah Bitcoin is again the most importantthing that's currently going on in myopiniondo you think the success of Bitcoin isinevitablehuhinevitable is a very big wordbut yeah I doI kind of doI think the cat is out of the back andyou knowBitcoin kind oftakes human greed and transformtransforms it into freedomthat's what it doesthat's why it works so well there are alot of greedy people in the world andthey use Bitcoin and they will continueto use Bitcoin and by using Bitcoin theyEmpower everyone else that uses Bitcoinfor freedomit is pretty astoundingthat Bitcoin is designed from the groundupto assume that all actors will actgreedy and in their own best interestsis there any other systems that we havethat act that way hmm I don't know Ithink I often I often think of Bitcoinas like a living breathing thing as likeacybernetic or organism if you if you ifyou want and I think a lot of things innaturewhile they arelike life is always self-interested in awayyou know like there's the idea of TheSelfish Gene and so on but it's stilllike all of life is symbioticit's not purelyself-interest in a senselike so self-interested that you bringdown the whole system that's not what'sgoing on and I think Bitcoin and moneyin general is the same most people don'trealize how important money is that's Ithink that's the main stumbling blockwhen it comes to understanding Bitcoinand how important it is for freedombecause there is onlywe only have money or violence to getsomething from strangersin small communities it's not a problemin a family it's not a problem a familyis like you know you don't need money ina family because you can trust familymembers usually and you can you can dothings on credit you know like I dosomething in neighborhoods that's how itworks you know like you do something foryour neighbor and he'll do something youknow some other day for you and so youdon't need moneybut to scale through those trustboundariesto really have large-scale societies youabsolutely need money it's the onlything that's that really scales becauseyou canget something from a stranger for moneyand the only alternative that we have isviolence you can either steal it or youcan you can go into a voluntaryrelationshipwith someone elsethat you don't trust by default but youwill trust the money if you can't trustthe money then you can trust thestranger and that's why also money is soimportant well why why final settlementand hard money is so important becauseonce the transaction is doneyou only need to trust the money youdon't need to trust a stranger anymoreand that's how societies scale that'show interactions scale and people don'tthink about this in the right way likehow amazing this is that weas humans figured outthat the proper way to interact withother people is on a voluntary basis andexchanging things because you want toand not taking them by force it's it's amore stable system the peaceful systemis always a more stable systemviolence is not stable it can't be it'sjust again from reasoning from firstprinciplesA system that needs Force to work is notstable because and it will also be outcompeted by A system that is peaceful bydefault and voluntary by default bydefault because you need to use theextra energy tobe violent and to put the pressure onthe system so to speak and if you have aif you have a system that thatworks symbiotically and worksvoluntarilythis system will always win that's inpart why I think it's it's inevitableif you hadfriend friend comes to you never usedBitcoin before has no idea what Bitcoiniswhere do they start huhgive them a couple of sets on lightningthat usually does the trick let theminstall some lighting wallet I usuallydon't do recommendations because youknow it changes all the time what is thebest wallet that's on but just make suretolet them experiencewhat it feels like to you knowget a couple of sets instantly and justthese are your sets no one can take themaway from you and I didn't you know likeyou youdon't need to do anything to sign up forBitcoin again back to the flipping thecoin what your phone does is the phonelocks itself in a secret place andgenerates a large random number flipsthe coin 265 times that's the math andout comes the Bitcoin address andconceptually it doesn't matter if youuse on chain of lightning or what that'swhat's happening and then immediatelyyou can start receiving Bitcoinbasically and experiencing that you youhave to experience it firsthand so bestthing best first step isget that friend some wallet to send themsome Bitcoin that's it and what if theydon't have a friendthere where do they startI don't know I think I think we're kindof passive Point everyone knows a crazyBitcoin guy somewhere somewhere no thereare many Bitcoins make more friends isthat make more friends whatwhat is your when you think of of yourday-to-day in in the Bitcoin space inthe education spacewhy do you do it why does it matteryeahI do it because it matters I thinkI I I truly believe that the world wouldbe a better place if more peopleunderstood Bitcoinand so I get up every day and I thinkyou know I'm I'm gonna write words andcode for Bitcoin that's what I'm gonnado and that's that's what I've beendoing for a couple of years now and yeahI think that's what what that's whypeople know me as well I wrote a littlebook called 21 lessons that's why Ithink most people know me and I mean I'mon Twitter too much still but I thinkall bitcoiners arebut I just try toI try to find ways toboth educatethe public but maybe more importantlyalso educate those that are alreadyclose to bitcoin how to think aboutBitcoin in a new way maybe and how toexplain some aspects of it and theimportance of those aspects in a littlebit of a different way and maybe evenmore digestible easier to understand waydid you learn anything from writing 21lessons oh yeah absolutely I mean thethe the subtitle of the book is whatI've learned from falling down theBitcoin rabbit hole and it's just abrief a summary of what I've learnedabout kind of the monetary side ofthings and the technology side of thingsbut most importantly maybe thephilosophical side of it like Bitcoin isa very new and strange thing that's I Ithink why most people have a hard timewrapping their head around it likenothing like it ever existed before andI learned a lot from Bitcoin and I stilldo like guys I I still I still work onbitcoin full time every single day Istill like most days I learn new stuffthat's just how it goes in your Bitcoinjourney in general is is there anythingyou would have changed that you wouldhave done differently maybe somethingwould have changed in 21 lessons afterhearing from readershmmI don't know I I don't consider 21lessons a proper book because it wasjust basically a very long tweet threattweet thread so I I wish I I thinkyou're selling yourself short I mean howlong is the book the book is no it's youcan read it in like two hours or sothat's it's it's not very long but I Iwish I would have put more meat on thebone so to speak but I'm I'm still I'mstill working with it that's that's inpart why why there's gonna be a afollow-up book called 21 ways which willbe 21 ways tolook at Bitcoin and I I mean I don'tregretI don't regret anything really I I thinkI absolutely love what I do what I doand Iagain mythe main thesis that I have is thatif more people would understand Bitcoineverything would be better so that'salso why I just I publish everythingthat I do under an open creativecomments license so you're free to copyand remix my stuff feel free to printthe book that you can read for freeonline print it yourself and sell it atthe corner store I don't care I justwant people to understand it in a betterway and so yeah no in in general I Iwishmaybe that's the one regret I shouldhave I should have quit my Fiat jobearlierit took me a long time to actually makethe plunge and uh yeah a kill off my oldcareer and go into Bitcoin full time butbest decision I ever made I mean you sayyou give out this books and your booksand your content it's it's all underopen source license anyone can take ityeah um but you do you do receive moneyfrom the community yeah I run everythingon a value for Value basis so if youthink my stuff is useful it's very easyto send some sets my way and people dolike it'sit's a very interesting concept and it'samazing how well it works and I mean nowit's automated with podcasting 2.0 whereyou know like you can actuallyprogrammatically Define that yourpodcast player while while you'relistening to an episode money will bestreaming to the people that are behindit and you can programmatically splitthis value stream to you know alsoinclude Charities and those kind ofthings and I absolutely love thisconcept and that's why everything I dolike works on that basis and well Iagain Ithe thing is that I never cared aboutmoney and I still don't I only careabout fixing the money and so that'sthat's why it works for me I I thinkinformation wants to be free and I'meven long before Bitcoin I was a hugesupporter of free and open sourcesoftware and I think those kind ofthings they should be freely availableforfor it for everyone and that's why allmy stuff is published under these kindof licenses where you can just you canjust take it anddo whatever you want with it do youthink that's the future of contentI actually do I thinkhuhI think it's a bigger idea that mostpeople realize I think like onlineadvertisement on online advertisementsare like uh I don't know a big bigbusiness billions and billions ofdollars and I think the value of a valuemodel can actuallyit it's a contender to the regularadvertisement based model and I think itcan produce more value in the sense thatif you as a content creator areabsolutely free to do what you want andyou haveyouthere's no self censorship involvedthere is no like fear of ever beingde-platformed and so onI think it will open up a lot ofyeahnew ways of doing things andproducing content and educating peopleand thinking about the world andproducing value and I think it will alsoopen up the discussion about value likehow valuableis information to you for example likethe the whole idea of the value forValue model isthat you as the senderyou already received the information youalready read the book you already readthe article you already listened to thepodcast episode and so onbut it kind of flips the whole thing onits head after the fact you have todecide how how much was this worth to mewas it like five bucks or 50 or 500like I've I've received a lot of valuefor for some people just because theyread one of my articles or one of thechapters of the book or what have youand and they found it so valuable thatthey they sent what I consider a lot ofmoney you know a lot of value back andof coursethere there are other ways to providevalue that's that's the other part ofthe value of a value model of thisequation like again everyone is free toto remix the content and I thinkthere's like over like 60 people orsomething that translatedum my book and and other articles that Iwrote in like 100 there's like 150translations in like you know countlesslanguages and that's another very niceway to give value back or like theiraudio versions of my book that peopledid freely because they they could andthey thought it it would provideadditional value and I agree andI I think there is so much untappedpotentialum that we can still exploreI mean in its core the ad model isbasically a surveillance model too yeahnot only that I think also I I I agreein large Parts with Adam Curry whomentions over and over again thatadvertisement is censorship because youdon't want to bite the hand that isfeeding you you know like very fewpeople talk badly about theiradvertisers for example and yourself-center of course as well you knowlike if they're if some company issponsoring youum and this company is in the news youmight be able like you you might notwant to talk about it and so on and so Iagree I think if you want to maximizefreedom and if you want to maximizecreative freedom I think the value forValue model is the way to goand that's a wrap[Music]foreignevery year the human rights Foundationhosts the Oslo Freedom Forum an eventfor human rights activists from all overthe world this may in Norway I had thepleasure of sitting down with Gigi Gigiis a bitcoiner and software engineer whowrites words and code for Bitcoin hisfirst book 21 lessons is one of the mostrecommended books among bitcoiners he'slaunched various projects in the Bitcoinspace and is now currently working onhis second book 21 ways his main focusis on privacy security free software andeducation[Music]when you think about freedomwhat does that mean to youwell that's a good question too start itoff I thinkI think if you don't have any freedomyou will notice it immediately and withwe take so manythings for granted and I thinkfirst of allit doesn't mean that you're absolutelyfree to do what you want you know likeyou're you should be free to go on akilling spree without consequences butI think in general you should be free tothink what you want and free to say whatyou want and alsowithin reason free to do what you wantyou know like there is this saying myfreedom to swing my arm and set yourface basicallyso yeah I think when I think aboutfreedom Ithink mostly aboutall the important rights that we landedon you know like freedom of speechfreedom of movement andyou know also freedom tokind of construct your life as you seefit as you wish so that would be oneanswer I guessdo you feel that there is a disconnectbetween people maybe that live inWestern countries that are more freeversus other countries where uh theymight have authoritarian governments orbe living less free worldoh I mean definitely I think most peopleare not aware especially if you'reliving in a more or less free country inin one of the Western countriesmost people are not aware how bad it isaround the world and how unfree somepeople are and like how some of theregimes function and I mean we're hereat the freedom forum andum just listen to those kind of storiesand the various Health that people wentthrough and you will understand veryvery quicklyand I always like the kind of there area couple of tests that will immediatelyopen your eyes to how free you are oryou aren't for example are you free tomake fun of the leader of your countryand there are some countries where youjust can't do that because you you'llyou'll immediately land in jail or worseandI think a lot of people in the westdon't realize this that this is realityfor a lot of people that you you can'teven make fun of someone like your lifewill be in danger if you make fun of thewrong person so to speakso I mean you do a lot of work in theeducation space both in Bitcoin freedomand privacyhow do you go aboutreasoning with people or helping themunderstand you know the lack of Freedomthat other people might be going throughlike how do you get them to really feelthatI I always try tokind of Start From First principlesand and reason up from there and it'sfor examplewith freedom of speechit's the only thing that we have tocourse correct our society tofigure out what we are doing wrong andtryingto fix that and trying to do it betteronce you start centering people once youcan't say certain things or talk aboutcertain things or certain people certainsituations certain Conceptsthen you're already down a very weirdand dark path becausethere is no other way tofixing things and cost correctingall our actions without talking about itand without being able to talk about itand figuring out the best wayand in the end we only have likeas aas a con like humans are networkedbeings and as like a network organismthe only way we haveis by talking about things and trying tofigure stuff out there's either that orimmediately you land on violence if youif you cannottalk it through and reason about it andfind the best solution that everyone iswilling to work towards voluntarily youimmediately like the only other optionthat you have is violence so it's it'seither freedom of speech or violenceand like that's a kind of firstprinciple of first principles approachto make people understand how importantthis is like most people don't thinkabout these things properly like theythey're like uh you can't say thatbecause people will get offended and solike that's not that's not what this isabout freedom of speech is not aboutoffending people it's not about beingable to say stuff to offend someonethat's like a byproduct that's somethingthat we need to deal with that'ssomething that you know likeyou we are weI love to take the risk to beingoffended because everything else wouldbe worse you know like silencing speechis way worse and yeah I think we have tothink about those things properly anddeeply because we went through all thosekind of various Hells before I mean justtake a glance at history and you willseehow bad things truly can get once youremove these freedoms and and theserights that are enshrined in the variousdocuments that we drafted over you knowhundreds and thousands of years and Imean we still have places whereum you know like you don't even have tolook at history you just have to look atI mean look at China for example youknow it's even though it's it's it's avery prosperous country over over thelastum you know decades they did very welleconomically in some regards but it'snot a very free country and you don'thave to kind ofyou know look for long toto see what happens and what kind ofauthoritarian regimes and housecapesopen up if you remove basic freedomslike freedom of speech and so ondo you think you can have freedomwithout privacynojust straight up now straight up now youneed you need the freedom you need toyou need at least the privacy of yourown home so that you can think what youwant and say what you want and discussthings that are currently off topiclike that um by off topic I mean thatare basically outside of the Overtonwindow like every every Revolution wasalways you knowum by definitioneverything that improves societiesoutside of the norm it was always it'sit's forbidden to talk about this it'sit's kind of you know even forbidden tothink those things just think about theGutenberg Revolution think about youknow like abolishing slavery you needyou need the privacy of your own home tomeet with someone else and discuss thosethings and and talk you through it eveneven for yourself you need the privacyof your own home at least to thinkthrough things by yourself to writeabout things for example and so on likewriting writing as far as I'm concernedis thinking about things properlyand so I don't think there's any freedomwithout privacybasically another way of saying the samething is that surveillance makes allother freedoms useless and you canimmediately tell thisjust by you know watch it people I meaneveryone knows this you know what shouldpeople at how they be how they behave ifthey think they're not being surveilledand then you tell them or you show themthat there was a camera or or somethingall along they immediately changed theirbehavior Everything Changesso yeahagain surveillance makes all otherfreedoms useless I mean we're seeingsurveillance grow throughout the worldas especially as we move to a moreDigital World a lot of times that is isby actual people choosing to besurveilled for a convenience uhadvantage and a lot of times it's forgovernments doing it we see kids beingborn into surveillanceis this something that concerns you isthis something that should concerneverybodyyeah it definitely concerns meumI think what what every what everyoneshould thinkum long and Hardy bodies these systemsonce they are builtbad people can take over almostimmediately very easily like oftentimesthese these systems like these thesesystems of convenience and surveillanceand so onI mean we see it with automated passportcontrol those kind of things you knowit's it's it's it's all it's all fineand it's all very convenientif you actually like and agree with thepeople in power that are controlling thesystem and that are currently in chargeof building these systems out and so onbut I mean again one quick glance athistory and you can see how quicklythings change and suddenly you have aninsane dictator in power and he hasaccess to those kind of systems and thenthings can getreally really bad really quickly and Ithink everyone that's why everyoneshould be concerned and also whyeveryone should kind oftake incremental steps ofincreasing their privacy and their likedata footprint and those kind of thingsI think it is just proper digitalhygiene that's that's one thing likethat's one way to think about itand I think it willbe increasingly important depending onyour situation and like where you livewhat you're doing what kind ofsituations you're presented withum yeah I think everyone will have tocare about this in one way or or anotherum I thinkthat's thethat's the world we're living incurrently andyou will be faced with a situation whereyou probablywish that you had more privacy or whereyou're forced to do things privatelylike if you have to flee your countryfor example those kind of things thenyeah you need to take care of thosethings otherwise your life will be indanger and I mean againjust look at how all the cases that arepresented here at the Oslo Freedom Forumthere are people dissidents andjournalists and people in really badsituations they need tolikeeven even when you're when you'respeaking up you need you need to havethe option to be private and to use apseudonym and be anonymous andum write about the people in power in away where you cannot be immediatelysquashed for example and so on so Ithink that's all of that is veryimportantI mean similar to me you are a publicfigure that advocates for privacyI often hear people say that it's it'shypocritical to do that that you can'tbe both public and be Pro privacyhow do you battle with that balance wellumI think it's kind of a spectrum how muchyou want tolet the public know about you and againprivacy is not secrecyit's privacy is about selectivelyrevealing yourself to the worldyou know to quote Eric Hughes andthat's exactly right like many peopleknow many things about me but it justkind of you knowit should it shouldn't be it should beharder than like 10 seconds on Google orwhatever search engine engine you'reusingto find out exactlyall of your past where you're currentlyliving and what you're up to and so on Ibelieve and that's kind of my goal in inshowing that that this is also possiblelike you can actuallyyou can be private online if you want tobe and I I also I want to normalizeprivacy I want to normalizeum pseudonyms as wellI I mean I I love how this wascompletely normal and still is in thegaming world for example like you don'tlike your name you spin up a new one youdon't like your name you don't like youravatar you change itand of course you know like this hangstogether with identity and reputationand so on and like all these things arecurrently being figured out but I don'tthink thata Facebook world is a nice world to livelive in where you have one identity andone image that defines you and one namethat defines you and one kind ofoccupation this is what you do and so onlike identityis always was and always will bePrismatic you are multiple people in onelike at church you're a different kindof person than you are at the at yourlike soccer club or what have you likeyou're a different kind of person at thebar thanum like you know like you are on yourjob depending depending what you do ofcourse and those kind of things areimportant and you cannotyou cannot kind oflike in in the Facebook world they wantyou to to believe that you only havethis kind of identity and you use it forabsolutely everything and you're you'rekind of the identity thatyour government gives you is notnecessarily your identity like it's Iknow many people thatwhere I I don't even know their realnames you know I don't even know thetrue names I don't I don't know theirtheir government names I know theirnames and I know those people very verywell and I've been knowing them likeI've known them for many many years andI consider them my friends and I thinkall of this should be normalized kind oflike we we don'twe shouldn'twe shouldn't take steps towards buildingan insane panopticon we should we shouldtake steps to move away from this worldI believe but isn't the panopticonalready built well to some extent yesbutI think more like I'm I'm in generaloptimistic I'm I would consider myselfan optimist even though I know how badthings arebut I think people are currently wakingup howhow bad it actually is I meanwe saw whole countriesbeing completely the platformed from thebanking system for example like withwith the click of a button and I I thinkwe will seeI was I think we will see this um thinkthings these things will happen morefrequently as it is easier to do this itwill happen more frequently sothe panopticon is built in part but it'snot complete yet not everything isabsolutely connected like there arestill somethere's still some friction if youactually want toI don't know the platform D platform uhcertain religious group from allsocietal services for example you cannotdo this with one push of the buttoncurrently worldwide definitely notand I thinkwe need to realize as a society thatthis is probably not a world we want tolive in we don't we should not continueto build up those systems and we shouldtake steps totear down the existing systems and fightagainst this like also speak out andalso use technology that allows you toprotect yourself use encryptiontechnologydon't give away your private informationdon't give away any unnecessaryinformation about yourself and yeahI have an optimistic Outlook about it Ithink people will learn the more peoplelike the more people and the morecountries and the more like groups ofpeople will get per will get burned theeasier it will be tolearn these things for them is that whatgives you hope that people will getburned and then they will learnno actually not I think in generalpeople are not stupidthat's what gives me hopeI don't believe in the stupid messes youknow masses can be be stupid and canbehave in Stupid Ways and so on but Ithink individuals are really smart and II view groups of people as just a bunchof individuals and they will figure itout and they will they will decide forthemselves what is importantand again I thinkpeople will realize that these kind ofthings are increasingly important I meanwe we see this you're you'reself-censoring and you're beingde-platformed everywhere Twitter is agreat example you know like you can'tsay certain things you'll be bannedimmediately like you'll you'll be inTwitter jail and so on and I think thereisa counter movement happening and peopleare kind of realizing how important itis to have open conversations forexample and to havefreedom of speech and freedom of thoughtandit's really important that you are ableto say what you think even if this thingis stupid everyone is stupid from timeto time we should be allowed to saywrong things and stupid things andoffensive thingsand I thinkwe've learned this the hard way so manytimesI hope that we don't have to learn itthe hard way again butwell again I'm an optimist we might haveto learn it the hard way again I hopenot I really hope notwell anyway GG you can't really seethrough your pillowcase butwe just had a Ukrainian protest walkthroughum I guess a pro-ukrainian protest uhwith the war going onum so obviously apologies to to you andall the listeners if if that got pickedupum yeah but that's a perfect example youneed to beyou need to be free to protest forexample that's that's another thingthat's super important like you knowthese are the kinds of freedoms we aretalking about and and in part likethat's a that's also a great examplefrom the Privacy privacy side of thingslike I encourage people to go protestingbut maybe think about what you bringwith you like if you have your mobilephone which is a live tracking devicewith you depending on your situationdepending on the government depending onthe protest it might be wiser to leavethe phone at home and yeah not build upa history that tracks you and yourlocation and that you have been at theprotest and so on and I mean we saw thisin Hong Kong and so on where people gotburned by this right I mean we saw it inAmerica too they were using it during abunch of protests in America they weretracking cell phones yeahwhat umwhat would you say to so when I talk topeople about privacy a lot of times whatI hear isI'm already completely a part of thesurveillance state right like I useFacebook I use Instagram I use all thesocial mediaI'm I'm already completely screwedthere's nothing I can do about it whatdo you tell those people there's alsothere's always something you can do andyou don't have to do it all at once I Iknow it can be very overwhelming and butyou have to take small steps in theright direction that's the only way todo it and yeah that might be true butyou can start by deleting your Facebooklike I can tell you your quality yourquality of life will improve but itdepends on your situation of course youknow like for some people Facebook isthe internet but it's you know like dodo youagain it every every situation isdifferent for every individual it willbe different but you you're free forexample to build up a second Personapseudonym if you want to do reporting ifyou want to write something if you wantto for example also publish a bookthere's a reason why authors have pennames you know there's a reason for thatand also you know of course in the musicindustry and so there are many peoplethat that use like different names asartists as their legal name and thereare reasons for that and you can do thatyou can reduce the the footprint of yourlegal identity and use a differentidentity you can also like switchecosystems and use for example softwarethat respects your privacy and softwarethat respects your rights and of coursethere's a free software movement that isall about that where you're free to useyour compute as you wish you're not theslave of your of your computer you'renot the slave of the system like if youhave a Facebook account you're the slavefor Facebook they can do what they wantthey can delete their account they candelete your posts and so on and thereare other there are other systems andother ways of doing things where thiscan never happen because you're incontrol and you're in charge and withthe money for example Bitcoin is theperfect example if you use Bitcoinproperly no one can debank you no onecan the platform you your account can'tbe frozen your transactions can't becanceled like if you know how to do thisand how to use it properly that's a stepin the right direction then you are youhave you're Sovereign when it comes toyour finances and you can take smallbaby steps likeyour note-taking app does it need tosurveil you do you need to use theGoogle note-taking app I don't think sothere are other there are other appsthat are really good standard nodeswould be one of them there are plentyothers and so just try to use encryptionby default try to use Messengers thatare open source and that have strongencryption built in those kind of thingsand you can you can do this in astep-by-step fashion like you don't haveto do itall at once and do it right from day onethat's impossible you have to learn youhave to adapt and you can again reducethe size of yourof your footprint of your onlinefootprint and you canyeah start to take care of your digitalhygiene it's very much like you knowstarting to work out and eating healthyit's like step by step little stepsevery single day and before you know ityou will before you know it thisargument completely Falls flat becausesuddenly you are more privatesuddenly you're not you did not giveeverything away you knowandyour life can also change like it mightbe true that some entity or somegovernment has all the information aboutyou now but you know like where you livecan change where you work can changeyour name can change your situation canchangeand you can change too and you can youcan learn to do this and you can learnto use use the tools as they say it'snot impossible I did it too I'm still inthe process I'm still trying to do thisin a better way and I'm learning everyday and I think that's the only way todo itso you didn't alwayshave conversations with the pillowcaseover your face no not always I also Iusually wear a green suit butunfortunately I didn't bring it so thisis like the poor man's screen suit wemade it work we made it work Iappreciate your privacyumyou know so I mean I'm obviously doing ashowthis showabout privacy and freedomand my face is being shownwhat do you think of that am I a dumbassI don't think you're a dumbassyou can also shave your beard and no onewill recognize you anymoreit's I mean magicians will tell you thatlike you you would you would like besurprised huh what a fake mustache andthe hat can do you know like peoplewon't recognize you anymore and I thinkpeople like we we kind of moved awayfrom a culture where this was more thenorm you know everyone wearing a trenchcoat and the hat and sunglasses and justeveryone kind of it was very easy toblend into a crowd and those kind ofthingsand currently you know like it'severyone is taking selfies all the timeand of course you know like that notthat there's anything wrong with thatbut it's just we we live in a in a bitof a different culture now and peopledon't realize how likeeven if you're a public Persona I meanthat's that's true for like very publicpeople as well there are ways to walkdown the street without you know peoplerecognizing you immediately soyou can do that Mattget a nice big hat nice big sunglasseswhat do you think about children cominginto this world right nowmore children like first first andforemostbut specifically this idea of thisbalance betweendigital all-encompassing surveillanceand being prepared for a digital worldat the same time hmmI meanI think the parents should be kind ofat least not completely careless in inthe sense thatum you know messing up your kids privacyfrom the get-goum I also think it I feel like itchanged a little bit maybe it's just forme maybe I'm very biased in that regardbut but I feel like it it used to bethat everyone was broadcasting all theinformation all the time just you knowlike posting it on Facebook andInstagram and so on and like how we useInstagram for example changed and how weuse Facebook change and now I feel likeit's more directed it's more like peopleusemore private channels like sending picsof the kids on WhatsApp to certaingroups and so on I I feel like you knowas a society we are kind of figuring outhow to how how to do this in a waysharing pictures and so on that's notcompletely insane you know like justputting it online for absolutelyeveryone to see like this changed overthe last 10 15 years alreadyand so I don't think that all is lostbut you know there are alsothey're veryfrightening developments kind of fromthe Privacy perspective in the EuropeanUnion for example they want to installspyware on all your devices that scanyour pictures and your texts before theyever get encrypted before they are evensent out so every time you snap apicture it'sscant andpeople should just be aware of that andthose are not great developments to putit mildlyumbut yeah it's it's kind of trickybecause we are living in thisI mean we're all digital Natives and thekids definitely are and soI don't think not usinga smartphone for example is an option II think youyou kind of have toyou have to learn how to use thosethings andumyou know I think a good idea Adam Careytalked about this as well um thatif you have kids try toteach them about the technology and showthem that there are other things as wellyou know like show them what Linux isset up a Linux sister and play aroundwith that and like flash a different OSon a smartphone and let them you knowlearn those kind of things and and playaround with it kids love this stuff Imean they love technology and justtinkering with stuff and figuringfiguring shit out and so I'm not I'm nottoo worried about it butagain I think as parentsI hope thatmore and more parents are more carefulwithum how they are handlinglike the the digital traces that the thethe digital breadcrumbs that they leaveall over the place you think there'sgonna be like a bit of a reckoning inthat regard as these kids get olderbecause this is the first generationthat really has had has grown up withsocial media that has grown up withyou know maybe listening devices intheir house whether that's Amazon orGoogle or whatnothmm that's a good question I don't knowI think in general the kids will be allright you know I grew up playingcomputer games violent ones quoteunquote like stuff like Doom at DukeNukem and so on and according to themainstream media at the time and thatwas a prevailing view for like 10 yearsplus that if you if you play this forlikemultiple hours a day you'll be a serialkiller you know and it turns out notevery gamer turned into a serial killerit's just something that gaming gotintegrated into society completely likeit's completely normal now I I stillremember a time where it absolutelywasn't you were a complete weirdo if youwere playing computer gamesand so I mean I'm still kind of a weirdoso that's that but it'sagain I think it will be fine I thinkthe kids will be all right and and theywill they will also learnI think they will learn how to handlethose kind of things and also the theecosystems that are currently worryingus I think they they will find a wayaround it kind of they they'll figure itoutso we met in the Bitcoin worldwe dida bunch of years ago you obviously arevery focused on bitcoin why is Bitcoinimportantoh I think Bitcoin is the most importantthing that's currently happeningperiod but especially if you care aboutfreedomBitcoin is insanely important like allall theall the people that are on a power tripand want to build authoritarian systemsand want to build the panopticons and soonthey can do this easily because in myopinion the money is broken and you canFinance this very easilyif we were on a Bitcoin standard alreadyit would be very hard to finance thosethings that's that's one reason whyBitcoin is important same is true forwar Samsung like it's very easy tofinance those things currently with thethe way the monetary system is set upand I thinkI think Bitcoin isthe return to a more sane and soundworldthat's my hope at leastand in the freedom realm again like ifyou use Bitcoin properlyno one no one can de-platform you no onecan cancel you no one can freeze youraccount no one can forcefully take theBitcoin away from you like at least notremotely you know like it'sit's like a gold coin that you have inyour pocket it can be stolen like if ifyouif you find the person and so on butthat's alsonot entirely true because Bitcoin what Ilove about Bitcoin is it's justinformation it has no physical body soto speakthat's why you can't have Bitcoin inyour head and you can literally haveBitcoin in your head and I mean everyBitcoin knows this but I feel like wedon't talk about this fact often enoughyou can have 12 words in your headand you can have all your wealth allyour possessions stored in these 12words in your head and you can getstripped naked and run all run acrossthe board and there's nothing anyone cando about it and if you if you make itback to safetyyou can enter these 12 words into like ahardware wallet or something and youhave access to all your wealth and it'sintactand that's very powerful and that's veryimportant for Freedom that's we we needtools like this that empower theindividual again and put the individualat the center and that's what Bitcoindoeswhen you think about Bitcoinwhat is your do you have any concernswith the current state of Bitcoin whatis your biggest concern huhapathyapathy that people don't caredo people caremore and more people care and that'svery good to see I think you know as theas the Fiat system the traditionalmonetary systemI think it's currently breaking down andat this as this increasesthe problems will increase and more andmore people will be waking up to thefact that Bitcoin is a viablealternative and the sound moneyalternative and something that you canjust use and you will always have accessto and no one can take it everywherefrom you Bitcoin will always be therefor you that's people that like peopledon't realize how profound this is youknow in that sense it's like gold youknow like gold will always be there foryou if you want to use it it doesn't goaway you know gold doesn't react toanything else it's you can't destroygold basically you I think you alsocan't destroy Bitcoin it's the same itwill the Bitcoin network will always bethere for you and what's also sopowerful like if if you're a dissidentfor example or journalists or what haveyou and you need to receive fundsall you need to do is to lock yourselfin the bathroom or something someprivate place and flip a coin a coupleof times and then you have a Bitcoinwallet it's just some math after thatbut you just need a large random numberand you can flip a coin 265 times andyou will have a valid Bitcoin walletthat's all you need to do that's that'swhy they call it permissionless youdon't need permission to do that youcan't just do thatand you will always be able to do thatand that's why Bitcoin is so powerfulyou can actually do this you can you canbe in the prison prison cell and do thisyou just need a way to communicate theoutput of this like the large number youdo some math and then you have a Bitcoinaddress and the Bitcoin address you canput anywhere you can put it on yourTwitter profile and so on and of courseyou know like currently Bitcoin is stillyoung like there are some privacyimplications with address reuse and soon I I don't think we need to get intothis this all of this is currently beingfigured out you know the example Ialways like to give forfor those kind ofshortcomings of the technology currentlyif you will it's like it it took us 30years to transition from a plain textinternet HTTP to httpsthat took us 30 years and it took ittook also on a societal level likepeople didn't carecryptographers cared but people didn'tit took someone like Edward Snowden toshow the people why this is importantwhy we needencryption online if everything is inplain text that's a really bad idea youknow for example with the internetand yeah we it took a long time for forus to really take this seriously andfigure it out and I don't think it willtake as long as as a time with withBitcoin I think people will figure outquickly quickerhow important Bitcoin is because moneyis kind of the most important thing inwhen it comes to your survivalit's really really hard to survive ifyou have zero money or the money breaksdownand soyeah Bitcoin is again the most importantthing that's currently going on in myopiniondo you think the success of Bitcoin isinevitablehuhinevitable is a very big wordbut yeah I doI kind of doI think the cat is out of the back andyou knowBitcoin kind oftakes human greed and transformtransforms it into freedomthat's what it doesthat's why it works so well there are alot of greedy people in the world andthey use Bitcoin and they will continueto use Bitcoin and by using Bitcoin theyEmpower everyone else that uses Bitcoinfor freedomit is pretty astoundingthat Bitcoin is designed from the groundupto assume that all actors will actgreedy and in their own best interestsis there any other systems that we havethat act that way hmm I don't know Ithink I often I often think of Bitcoinas like a living breathing thing as likeacybernetic or organism if you if you ifyou want and I think a lot of things innaturewhile they arelike life is always self-interested in awayyou know like there's the idea of TheSelfish Gene and so on but it's stilllike all of life is symbioticit's not purelyself-interest in a senselike so self-interested that you bringdown the whole system that's not what'sgoing on and I think Bitcoin and moneyin general is the same most people don'trealize how important money is that's Ithink that's the main stumbling blockwhen it comes to understanding Bitcoinand how important it is for freedombecause there is onlywe only have money or violence to getsomething from strangersin small communities it's not a problemin a family it's not a problem a familyis like you know you don't need money ina family because you can trust familymembers usually and you can you can dothings on credit you know like I dosomething in neighborhoods that's how itworks you know like you do something foryour neighbor and he'll do something youknow some other day for you and so youdon't need moneybut to scale through those trustboundariesto really have large-scale societies youabsolutely need money it's the onlything that's that really scales becauseyou canget something from a stranger for moneyand the only alternative that we have isviolence you can either steal it or youcan you can go into a voluntaryrelationshipwith someone elsethat you don't trust by default but youwill trust the money if you can't trustthe money then you can trust thestranger and that's why also money is soimportant well why why final settlementand hard money is so important becauseonce the transaction is doneyou only need to trust the money youdon't need to trust a stranger anymoreand that's how societies scale that'show interactions scale and people don'tthink about this in the right way likehow amazing this is that weas humans figured outthat the proper way to interact withother people is on a voluntary basis andexchanging things because you want toand not taking them by force it's it's amore stable system the peaceful systemis always a more stable systemviolence is not stable it can't be it'sjust again from reasoning from firstprinciplesA system that needs Force to work is notstable because and it will also be outcompeted by A system that is peaceful bydefault and voluntary by default bydefault because you need to use theextra energy tobe violent and to put the pressure onthe system so to speak and if you have aif you have a system that thatworks symbiotically and worksvoluntarilythis system will always win that's inpart why I think it's it's inevitableif you hadfriend friend comes to you never usedBitcoin before has no idea what Bitcoiniswhere do they start huhgive them a couple of sets on lightningthat usually does the trick let theminstall some lighting wallet I usuallydon't do recommendations because youknow it changes all the time what is thebest wallet that's on but just make suretolet them experiencewhat it feels like to you knowget a couple of sets instantly and justthese are your sets no one can take themaway from you and I didn't you know likeyou youdon't need to do anything to sign up forBitcoin again back to the flipping thecoin what your phone does is the phonelocks itself in a secret place andgenerates a large random number flipsthe coin 265 times that's the math andout comes the Bitcoin address andconceptually it doesn't matter if youuse on chain of lightning or what that'swhat's happening and then immediatelyyou can start receiving Bitcoinbasically and experiencing that you youhave to experience it firsthand so bestthing best first step isget that friend some wallet to send themsome Bitcoin that's it and what if theydon't have a friendthere where do they startI don't know I think I think we're kindof passive Point everyone knows a crazyBitcoin guy somewhere somewhere no thereare many Bitcoins make more friends isthat make more friends whatwhat is your when you think of of yourday-to-day in in the Bitcoin space inthe education spacewhy do you do it why does it matteryeahI do it because it matters I thinkI I I truly believe that the world wouldbe a better place if more peopleunderstood Bitcoinand so I get up every day and I thinkyou know I'm I'm gonna write words andcode for Bitcoin that's what I'm gonnado and that's that's what I've beendoing for a couple of years now and yeahI think that's what what that's whypeople know me as well I wrote a littlebook called 21 lessons that's why Ithink most people know me and I mean I'mon Twitter too much still but I thinkall bitcoiners arebut I just try toI try to find ways toboth educatethe public but maybe more importantlyalso educate those that are alreadyclose to bitcoin how to think aboutBitcoin in a new way maybe and how toexplain some aspects of it and theimportance of those aspects in a littlebit of a different way and maybe evenmore digestible easier to understand waydid you learn anything from writing 21lessons oh yeah absolutely I mean thethe the subtitle of the book is whatI've learned from falling down theBitcoin rabbit hole and it's just abrief a summary of what I've learnedabout kind of the monetary side ofthings and the technology side of thingsbut most importantly maybe thephilosophical side of it like Bitcoin isa very new and strange thing that's I Ithink why most people have a hard timewrapping their head around it likenothing like it ever existed before andI learned a lot from Bitcoin and I stilldo like guys I I still I still work onbitcoin full time every single day Istill like most days I learn new stuffthat's just how it goes in your Bitcoinjourney in general is is there anythingyou would have changed that you wouldhave done differently maybe somethingwould have changed in 21 lessons afterhearing from readershmmI don't know I I don't consider 21lessons a proper book because it wasjust basically a very long tweet threattweet thread so I I wish I I thinkyou're selling yourself short I mean howlong is the book the book is no it's youcan read it in like two hours or sothat's it's it's not very long but I Iwish I would have put more meat on thebone so to speak but I'm I'm still I'mstill working with it that's that's inpart why why there's gonna be a afollow-up book called 21 ways which willbe 21 ways tolook at Bitcoin and I I mean I don'tregretI don't regret anything really I I thinkI absolutely love what I do what I doand Iagain mythe main thesis that I have is thatif more people would understand Bitcoineverything would be better so that'salso why I just I publish everythingthat I do under an open creativecomments license so you're free to copyand remix my stuff feel free to printthe book that you can read for freeonline print it yourself and sell it atthe corner store I don't care I justwant people to understand it in a betterway and so yeah no in in general I Iwishmaybe that's the one regret I shouldhave I should have quit my Fiat jobearlierit took me a long time to actually makethe plunge and uh yeah a kill off my oldcareer and go into Bitcoin full time butbest decision I ever made I mean you sayyou give out this books and your booksand your content it's it's all underopen source license anyone can take ityeah um but you do you do receive moneyfrom the community yeah I run everythingon a value for Value basis so if youthink my stuff is useful it's very easyto send some sets my way and people dolike it'sit's a very interesting concept and it'samazing how well it works and I mean nowit's automated with podcasting 2.0 whereyou know like you can actuallyprogrammatically Define that yourpodcast player while while you'relistening to an episode money will bestreaming to the people that are behindit and you can programmatically splitthis value stream to you know alsoinclude Charities and those kind ofthings and I absolutely love thisconcept and that's why everything I dolike works on that basis and well Iagain Ithe thing is that I never cared aboutmoney and I still don't I only careabout fixing the money and so that'sthat's why it works for me I I thinkinformation wants to be free and I'meven long before Bitcoin I was a hugesupporter of free and open sourcesoftware and I think those kind ofthings they should be freely availableforfor it for everyone and that's why allmy stuff is published under these kindof licenses where you can just you canjust take it anddo whatever you want with it do youthink that's the future of contentI actually do I thinkhuhI think it's a bigger idea that mostpeople realize I think like onlineadvertisement on online advertisementsare like uh I don't know a big bigbusiness billions and billions ofdollars and I think the value of a valuemodel can actuallyit it's a contender to the regularadvertisement based model and I think itcan produce more value in the sense thatif you as a content creator areabsolutely free to do what you want andyou haveyouthere's no self censorship involvedthere is no like fear of ever beingde-platformed and so onI think it will open up a lot ofyeahnew ways of doing things andproducing content and educating peopleand thinking about the world andproducing value and I think it will alsoopen up the discussion about value likehow valuableis information to you for example likethe the whole idea of the value forValue model isthat you as the senderyou already received the information youalready read the book you already readthe article you already listened to thepodcast episode and so onbut it kind of flips the whole thing onits head after the fact you have todecide how how much was this worth to mewas it like five bucks or 50 or 500like I've I've received a lot of valuefor for some people just because theyread one of my articles or one of thechapters of the book or what have youand and they found it so valuable thatthey they sent what I consider a lot ofmoney you know a lot of value back andof coursethere there are other ways to providevalue that's that's the other part ofthe value of a value model of thisequation like again everyone is free toto remix the content and I thinkthere's like over like 60 people orsomething that translatedum my book and and other articles that Iwrote in like 100 there's like 150translations in like you know countlesslanguages and that's another very niceway to give value back or like theiraudio versions of my book that peopledid freely because they they could andthey thought it it would provideadditional value and I agree andI I think there is so much untappedpotentialum that we can still exploreI mean in its core the ad model isbasically a surveillance model too yeahnot only that I think also I I I agreein large Parts with Adam Curry whomentions over and over again thatadvertisement is censorship because youdon't want to bite the hand that isfeeding you you know like very fewpeople talk badly about theiradvertisers for example and yourself-center of course as well you knowlike if they're if some company issponsoring youum and this company is in the news youmight be able like you you might notwant to talk about it and so on and so Iagree I think if you want to maximizefreedom and if you want to maximizecreative freedom I think the value forValue model is the way to goand that's a wrap[Music]foreign",
