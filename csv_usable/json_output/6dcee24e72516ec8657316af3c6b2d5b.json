eventsand conversations in Bitcoin as well asthe tools and strategies that can beused to protect our right toinformational self-determination[Music]well Janine thank you for for joining usI'm very excited for this conversationso to get startedwherewhen you think about when you thinkabout Freedom what iswhat does freedom mean to youum freedom I mean so I have there's asong that I like that I've actually usedthe lyrics I plan to use the lyricseventually for podcasts umit's by Kings of convenience and theysayumI can't rememberum freedomfreedom is no greater than its owner noview is wider than the eye and I reallylike that lyricum a lot a lot I think it's in from analbum that's called Declaration ofdependenceand it's kind of about how uh I mean Ithink what the album is about is that Ithink it's all American singers andum we we like to think that we'reindependent but we actually have a lotof dependencies on things that um Canoften take away our freedomone of those of course I think is themonetary system like uh I meanfor the most part I've lived incountries where there's a relativelyhigh amount of economic freedomum especially when it comes toum any anything to do with religion orreading textsor more recently sexuality like that'srelatively free and there's a lot ofplaces in the world where that isn't thecaseand I think money is very important forthat becauseif you're not able to economicallysupport yourself if you're not able toassociate with others in terms offorming businesses or choosing whatproducts to buy or services to useum then effectively it becomes very hardto be yourself or Express Yourselfand so if you have a monetary systemwhere your choices affect whether youare even able to use money at all or ifyou're restricted to only using it forcertain things even if they cause noharm whatsoever to anyone elseum then I think your freedom in so manyother ways is restricted like yourfreedom of speech is impacted yourfreedom of Association is impactedum all of those thingsum to some level come back to moneywe've seen that with you know cancelculture recently whichum I think some of it can be legitimatewhen it's challenging people of powerwho have not been held to account likesome of it is a form of boycottingthat's basically being applied toindividuals but I think in a lot ofcases especially when thethe allegations aren't based on solidevidenceessentially what people are doing is uhMass disassociationand you know we can say well they allhave the freedom to do that and ofcourse I agree if they don't want togive money to someone that's fine butum if that happens on such a scale wherea person is basically excluded from theeconomy maybe even they get their bankaccount shut down depending on what theallegation isthen effectively they can't live andI've heard from people who haveexperienced this personally and a lot ofthem say I think there was even a bookby John Ronsonwhere he interviewed someone and theybasically said uh who had experiencedthis kind of backlash and he saidbasically these people just want me todisappear and go away they want me todie without actually saying thatum and he he also said somethinginteresting where it's like he they wantto use me as a cultural referencefor like what you shouldn't do sofreedom to me is thatwell you should obviously be able toexpressyour dislike for people who you thinkhave doneharm to others you should also have waysto protect yourself against that beingused for example political censorshipbecause that is also happening and Ithink people need to be more careful youknow we I think there's a lot ofresponsibility in having Freedom as wellfor example recently with the wasabiblacklisting which was very unfortunateum someone who's a contributor made theargument thatWasabi is within the right to do thisbecause they own the server he wasmaking a property rights argument and Idon't know I don't disagree with that Idon't think anyone was saying like theWasabi doesn't have the right to do whatthey did they own the server they'reoffering the service they can choose notto or to change itand they do have the right but thatdoesn't mean just because you have theright to do something doesn't mean thatother people won't uh be impacted by itwon't dislike itum and they have to take that intoaccountum so freedom is I think when you'reliving in a complex society it's reallya constant negotiation where you shouldbe able to express yourself and get thethings that you need and wantbut you also have to deal with everyoneelse around you who's trying to do thesame thing and sometimes that conflictsso it's a constant negotiationit's very much affected by your economicpowerand it's affected by the politicalsituation that you find yourself in andhow much you are contributingto that system that makes a lot of senseto me I you know you are a independentjournalist focused on privacy andfreedom I have a lot of respect for yourwork uh it's an honor to call you afriend and to have you here speakingwith mewhen you you hit an interesting pointthere where you mentioned that we havethe benefit of living inin relatively free countriesum and get to enjoy a good amount ofFreedom when you talk to people and andyou you know in your writing how do youhow do you frame to them how do you makeit make them understand or help themunderstand uh the importance of freedomand how you know people in othercountrieshow how they're dealing with it rightlike how do you get people to relate toit because that's something I've noticedthat is very very difficult to do mostpeople just have blinders onyeah um I mean in my experience I findit I find it harder to con to talk topeople or convince them of the value ofFreedom when they already live with itin abundance right and they don'tappreciate it necessarilyum I don't really have to convincepeople who are living in places wherethey don't have it that they need itbecause they already want it even ifthey don't consciously they're notconsciously thinking about it I thinkevery day they're aware of to somedegree what what else might be out therethat they don't have access toum and that they want to experience itbut for various reasons they can't likeum I mean also one of the benefits ofliving in a country that has a lot offreedom is that you not only havefreedom in that place you haveprivileges that you canuh take to other places you can have alot you can a lot of these countrieshave vis-a-free travel or very limitedvisa restrictions to go to go to otherparts of the world where converselypeople in those countries that theyvisit can't visit their country or it'svery hard to doum so it's also it's very much tied likeyour your freedom is not only within thearea that you are that has a relativelyhigh amount of Freedom it's also the thepolitical privilege that you carry withyou with your you know national identitydocumentsum so I mean there's a massivedisconnect there right there there'sthere's a group of peopleumwho the importance of freedom is veryobvious to them and those are those arepeople that generally live in less freecountries and then there's a group ofpeople thatthey don't even really think about itand is that disconnectever going to be solved is that asoluble disconnect is or is that justyou know something that we just have tolive with when when we work in thisspaceum I definitely think there's adisconnect I've noticed especially whenit comes to money likeI've been to so many places where you goin and they just assume you have youhave bank cards rightum I actually went to a cafe once Ithink it was in the UK and I walked inand I tried to get something with cashbecause I'm very much a cash-basedperson I pretty much do all of mytransactions in cash unless I have noother option and I went to this Cafe andI wanted to purchase something and hesaid nope we only take cards I saidbecause at the time I actually didn'thave a bank card that would work in theUK and I said that and he said are you arefugeeand on one hand I found that kind ofinsulting because I thought well if I amyou're saying that you wouldn't take mymoneyyou like I I'm at a you knowdisadvantaged position and you wouldn'ttake my money but then on the other handI also thought well do I have to be onefor you to respect my choice or maybeit's not even my choice I mean for meit's at the time in that instance itwasn't a choice I only had cash butusually I do have a choice between cashor bank cards and I always choose cashbecause I prefer that but a lot ofpeople use cash because that is theironly choice they get paid in cash forwhatever reason they can't get a bankaccount or it's very expensive to useum so he not only wasn't his or him orhis business wasn't respecting my choicebutum yeah I found that interesting andyeah I think there's a lot of Disconnectin the financial sector where theyespecially in countries where it'sbecoming more and more the case thatthey assume that you already have thesethings that they expect that that willalways be the case and that will be goodand that will never be used against usand that's part of whyum we have this cbdc panel coming upthat uh I assume part of what we'regoing to say is thatwell we uh we already see what'shappening withum the financial system as it is and therestrictions they're putting on it whywould we give them even more powerto restrict us especially whenthey basically give lip service toprivacy but they don't they haven'tdemonstrated that they actually careabout it in any way like what they'redoing what they're doing trying to getrid of cash what they're doing withincreasing AML uh legislation which isreally clamping down onand increasing the need foridentification at every level they'redemonstrating that they don't want togive more privacy or even keep the samelevel of privacy that we have nowand I think they don't understand howdangerous that isthe biggest disconnect that I've learnedabout recently is like the extent towhich a lot of this anti-moneylaundering policy has literally noeffect whatsoever on money launderingaround the world there's a ton of papersnow that shows that the amount that theamount of like criminal proceeds thatthey're capturing is like one percent orlessand there was even a paper I think bythe United NationsumI think it was the office of drugs andcrime they published it way back in2011. and they they had an excellentline in there where they were like ourour money launder is so much smarterthan drug dealers because they made thispoint that like we're capturing a lotmore of the drugs around the world thanwe are this laundered moneyum are the money launder is so muchsmarter than drug dealers or there isthere something wrong with this systemum and it's unfortunate because not onlyis it super ineffective but it's keepinga lot of people out of the financialsystem because they're putting up thesebarriers do you think that does thateven matter the logic that it doesn'tdoesn't work to stop criminals do youthink those laws are actually there tostop criminals or are they there tosurveil the broader population is itjust an excuse at the criminal side yeahI mean I I mean I don't know I haven'tmet too many peopleum personally in the field to saywhether in their heart of hearts theyactually think it's effectivebut no I I think to some degree theymust know that it doesn't workum and you know whether whether it'seffective or not maybe it would be supereffective and I would still think thatthey were they were costs to it whichwas Financial exclusion but given thatit's definitely not working and then wealso have the financial exclusion it's asuper it's a really bad deal but I feellike if you talk to a lot of them theywould say Okay so let's we shouldcollect even more information we shouldput up even more barriers right yeah Imean I don't I don't know how they couldcollect even I didn't think they couldbut at that pointum I mean there's something to be saidfor likeuh there's a reason that we don't dothis with cashum there is another paper that I readthat I think was the sameit was actually a paper financials itwas called Financial surveillance whocares and it was aboutumessentiallylike the kind of the the adversereaction to anti-money laundering policyand like where is it coming from whatare the arguments it was kind of just asummary of that so like I went with cashum we were you were talking earlierabout you went into a store they didn'taccept cash right and I so I seeumI see in America and I see among mypeers uh a push away from cash both fromon the business sideum but also just like on a user side alot of people choose convenience of theylike their payment apps they like theircredit cardsum a lot of people I went to school withchoose not to use cash they prefer notto use cashdo you thinkas a global Society cash is dying iscashis Cash going to be short-lived in thisworld and a world without cash what doesthat world look like to youuh I definitely think cash is dying incertain parts of the world I I'vedeliberately chosen to live in placeswhere I think still 50 or more of thetransactions are made in cashand I thinkthere are many parts of the world whereit will take much much longer if ithappens at all to transition out of cashjust becauseyou have a large older generation whodoesn'twho isn't up to switchingumyou also just have a lot of distrust inthe the government the system in generalthat they don't even want to use itbecause they're suspicious of it I thinkthat was happening to a degree in ElSalvador even with Bitcoin like becausethey went through dollarization beforethat and didn't the results of that fora lot of people weren't that great andthey kind of suspected that Bitcoinwould have a similar effect so there's alot of resistance initiallyum especially given that the governmentwas involved in promoting Bitcoin rightum yeah I think I think a big part ofthe reason that people are a lot ofpeople are sort of voluntarilytransitioning away from cash on theirown is becauseum the the the people that build thedigital Financial system they try veryhard to make sure that the costs of thatare hidden from youum for example most people aren't awareof the huge amount of data that iscollected about them just so that theycan use a credit card right they're notaware of how the credit system works andhow it can be very toxicumand I think if people were more aware ofthose costs if it was more clear to themthen they might change their mind that'sactually been a case with privacy forpeople who don't they're not they don'tvalue privacy or they're not sure whatthey should do about it once you showthem the costs of not doing somethingthen theyum there's kind of a paradox wherepeople a lot of people say they careabout privacy but in practice they don'tdo that much about itbut once you that was initially that wasassumed likeit was assumed that the reason for thatis because people were basically lyingabout how much they valued privacy rightbut the reality was that they justdidn't actually understand how thesystems they were using worked like theythought they were using them properlythey thought they did care somewhatabout their privacy and they were doingit in the right way and then whensomeone showed them well no this is whatyou're doing this is how it's harmingyou here's a better way to do it thanthey actually did it so it was actuallyjust a it was a question of Education itwas an education shortfall yeah a lot ofa lot of this is just education likethere was a paper I think in 2017 that Iwrote aboutwhere it was like misconceptions peoplehad about privacy and like about thingslike email and SMS texting and even in2017 or 2016 whenever they did thesurvey most people were still under theimpression that SMS texts were secretand that email was very secure and allof this and the reason that they gaveactually for that was because Banks useit Banks use it to send notificationsand if my bank is communicating with mein this medium it must be secure becausemy bank wouldn't use an insecure mediaum so it's part of it is also theyassume that they can trust theseinstitutions to know what they should beusing and they kind of shift that burdenum onto them and then it turns out to bevery wrongwould you say that the but at least inmy experience like what I've noticed isa lot of peoplekind of they're kind of aware that theythat that they're at risk that they havethese concerns but it's not until theyactually get burned that they start totry and improve their setup would youagree with that with like peopletouching the stove is probably thenumber one way they start to improve intheir their current situationum obviously was I agree I agree thatthat is often number one way that likethat's where the major shift usuallyhappensI don't think that that's how it shouldI I like part of what I do with myeducation like I made a privacy courseum and the recommendation I had was thatpeople should be proactive about thisbecauseit's uh part of the problem with relyingon that on this like Sudden Change as aresult of catastrophein a way it's it's very hard to thendo like a speed run of the education ina way where you're doing it properlywhereas if you're proactive about it andyou prepare before catastrophe happensthen you not only have more time toabsorb the information you implementeverything correctly and you're notunder a huge amount of stress rightum so I definitely encourage people likeyou knowyes you haven't had a data breach yetyou haven't had an identity theft yetyou haven't had money stolen from youyet but here's the ways in which itcould happen based on what you'recurrently doingand you do not want to start fixingthese holes once the hole gets so bigthat you know you you have no choice butto do it the time to fix the ship isn'twhen it's sinking yeahyeah like you might survive but um it'sit's not fun to be learning UnderPressure that wayso I encourage people to be proactiveeven though that's also difficultbecauseit takes timeyou're not fully aware of the incentivesof the or the like the reasons to do itat the beginning but I think it'sI think it's healthier and easier tostart now and do it slowly than tohave to rapidly go through it laterlet's pull it back a little bit sowhen when did you start uh when did youdecide you wanted to be an independentjournalist focused on privacy and whatwas the reason for that what was thetriggering moment where you realized youknow privacy is is thisyou know insanely important topic intoday's ageum I mean that's quite a long story Imean I I would say initially as when Iwas a lot youngerI was almost a technophobe becauseactually I enjoy the outdoors I verymuch likeuh low-tech stuffum for as long as I can remember and sowhen it came to things likeum anything to do with the internet whenI was younger I was actually one of thepeople who was like I'm going to usethis as minimallythe minimal amountum that I need to because II was part of a generation that I'mconstantly getting talked givenpropaganda about how there's all theseonline Predators right to come after youum you can get infected with viruses andmalware and all of this and when I wasyounger it was like an onslaught of likeinformation about threatsum and I think for most of my life I'vebeen very sensitive to that if I getinformation about something that couldpossibly harm me then I kind of try toavoid it and so for a long time Iactually had very little interest inlike hype anything high-techumand so I and but that was because Icared about privacy like I didn't Ididn't want I wanted to avoid harm thatwas it was harm reductionum but then it got to a point especiallywithumuh around 2013um the uprisings and everything andWikileaks and how they were using allthis wasn't super new at the time butlike using technology in new ways todo journalism and it was super effectivefor like the number of people that wereinvolved the number of Publications theydid was massive compared to what mostjournalists produce year on yearum so I saw that and I basicallyswitched tookay I also want to do this kind of workI'll have to use this technology andinstead of just avoiding it and being abit of a technophobe I would embrace itbut also figure out how it worked sothat I could still protect myself fromthreats that I perceivedum but I've always been I think I'vealways been a private personum part of that is because I didn't growup in a cityso just naturally you know I would lookout my window and I wouldn't seeNeighborsumbecause there would be trees like a lotof obscurity and so just in my mysurrounding environment I had a lot ofprivacy and I think people who grow upin the city because they'renot used to that they just kind of getused to the opposite they're constantlysurrounded by people they can hear theirneighbors they can see their neighborsumand everybody's in a confined spaceum their expectation for privacy islower and I think that that extends toa lot of times the internet as well andsocial media and I was the opposite Iwas veryumI restricted that and I still am todaybut I've come to you a bit of a betterbalance in terms of usingthe technology to pursue my goals ratherthan avoiding it what would you say topeople whodo not think privacy is something theyshould consider like why what would yousay to people that don'tdon't think privacy is importantumI I would first point out the ways inwhich I actually think they do careabout privacy they just maybe don'trealize that they doand that if those things went away thatthey would probably hate itum like most peopleare okay with having curtains on theirwindow and closing them at night so thatyou know especially in a city where youcan often see throughyour neighbor's Windows people are okaywith that like there's this an assumed Imean we wear clothes that is areflection of us wanting to have someprivacy with our bodyand there's a lot of variation in thatbut most people go around wearingclothes and that's you know that's anexample of privacy of the bodyand you know now with facial recognitionwe have to deal with not only justpeople that are actually in our vicinityseeing us we have to deal with people ina data center far awayum not only seeing us in the moment buthaving a record of that all the time andI don't think people have fullyunderstood the implications of that ofhaving a record ofevery place you go at all times I thinkpart of that is becauseexample in this country it'suh there's a lot ofum there's not really a lot of politicalrepression and so people aren't worriedabout the the state having thatsurveillance on them I mean there's nottoo much CCTV here but there are somecamerasum andyeah it's I think I was actually sayingthis to someone last night that theproblem withcountries like Norway and a lot of othercountries when they explore newtechnologythey they celebrate it rightum and part of the reason they celebrateit is because they're not necessarilyworried that anyone in their environmentis going to abuse that technology toharm themwhereas if you go to other places in theworld where that's not the case that newtechnology can be used tosurveil and repress peopleso if you don't have the restraint inyour uh in your political environmentwhere those abuses can't happenumthen then you become much more aware ofhow available privacy isclearly like this is not this is not thetype of clothes that you wear on a dailybasisum most people I I imagine a lot ofpeople who are watching this use socialmedia they post pictures of themselvestheir family their friends all the timemany different sites many differentServices you know maybe they have aa ring doorbell camera that sends videoof them to Amazon servers every timethey enter their house or their officeumto why why do you valuejust not disclosing your face why do youkeep your face private what would yousay to those people of you know toexplain what your stance is in thatregarduhthe reasonI mean I I mean part of it is just I wasI was never really a fan of takingpictures of myself in generalum but the reason especially in the lastcouple of years where I've tried veryhard it's kind of a paradox where I'm aprivacy Advocate but I also am trying tobe a public speaker and I did not I didnot anticipate many years ago that I wasgoing to be a public speaker so it'sdefinitely a tricky thing to do whereyou're in the public eye and trying toshare ideas butthere's this expectation that you alsoshare your identityum and in a in a physical way not justin your ideasum andI I thinkit definitely conflicts I think withMy Generation in particular but peoplein general is that a lot of peoplethey not only like doing that but theyhave they have this desire to be famouslike they would they would like to wakeup one day and see their name or theirface in a paper and being celebrated andthat's not necessarily A Bad Thing toto want acceptance and praise for whoyou are but at some levelthat can also be really detrimentalbecause if you ask a lot of famouspeopleyou know if if they could go back andchange something what would they do alot of them say they would try to havemore privacyum that's the thing that they actuallywant the most because often times theirhome address is known by everyonethey go to a restaurant they getphotographed if they get into arelationship everybody knows within acouple minutesumand they just constantly feel on edgebecause on one hand you get you have thebenefit of this praise and thisum admiration but on the reverse it canalso turn into revulsion and angerum and judgment and they definitelydon't want that and it often limits whothey can become and so for me personallyI like to be able to walk down thestreet anywhere and not be recognizedunfortunately I do get recognized for myvoice but I solve that by just nottalkingum I like to be able to just walk downthe street and nobody knows me and theonly way that people will know me is ifthey already know me or if I want themto get to know me uhotherwise like it it gives me thatchoice andI also don't given that I am a publicspeaker I also don't want to be in aposition whereumI don't I don't know if I will ever befamous famous but I never want to be ina position where I feel like I have topigeonhole myself because I'm worriedabout uh people getting angry at me andcoming after me for the opinions that Ihave like I want to be able to speak asfreely as possibleum and that's also why I want to useBitcoin because I want to also be ableto spend my money as freely as possibleand not be limited by the policies thatany given bank has or a paymentprocessor or what have you so they'rekind of related but yeah I just I wantto keep that freedomum and so I hide my face becauseum I feel like that actually gives memore freedom like to be clear you're notwearing that mask to protect fromdisease noum I mean I I'm yeah I'm not worriedabout disease because I'm a quite I'mquite a healthy person I did not getcovered once this entire pandemicum so no I'm not worried about diseaseso I mean it is very convenient thoughum I don't know how I am tempted toactually keep wearing masksum just because it's anti sort ofanti-facial recognition butunfortunately I think a lot of thesystems have gotten smarter wherethey're if you're wearing a mask they'relooking atum like your eyebrows or your foreheadyeah so the mask isn't which is why Ihave two I mean that was an interestingthat was an interesting situation withthe covered response just in generalbecause in a lot of places wearing maskswas either illegal or like borderlinecriminalized and I know in New York likethere's a law in the books that like twopeople can't be together uh wearing amask at the same time yeah very veryinteresting flip where suddenly became acrime to not not to not cover your facebut personallyum you know I've as as a public privacyAdvocate myself I've obviously wrestledwith the sameuh trade-offs that that you were justdiscussingumI've often been called a hypocriteuh for for being a public privacyAdvocate as if you can't be both publicand pro privacy at the same timeum personally I do regret uh some days Iwake up in the morning I regret that Iexpose my faceum that my face is known one of thethings is you can't ever go backum once that happens yeah actuallybefore I came here I was talking tosomeone about what I did and when Imentioned that I don't have any picturesof me online then they asked oh how didyou get them all taken down right and myresponse was I never put them up in theum what would you say to the people thatsaypublic figures that advocate for privacyare hypocritesum I I don't I don't think it'shypocritical I mean it may it depends Ithink it's a scale but I I don't thinkit's hypocritical becauseum for me privacy is about consentum and I mean even though you may regretthat you also have a public face as wellumI mean you did choose you weren't forcedto do thatum even if maybe you regret yourdecision and I think continuing to do itis also a choice and so for me privacyis about consent andum I think a lot of people have the ideathat I'm not exactly representing thecontrary but a lot of people have theidea that um privacy is about you knowcompletely obscuring yourself and hidingand people can do that I think it's ascale thoughum based on your choices and your threatmodel and the way you want to live yourlife and I think you should always havethe option to go at different points ofthe scale but I don't think it's invalidfor someone to have a public face andpost pictures but also care aboutprivacy I don't think that invalidatesit becauseyou can have a public face and still beprivate about where you live and whatyou're doing and where you're spendingyour moneyum there's a lot of people who have allof those things and have very littleprivacy so I thinkas long as you're working towards it inother areas of your life ifif the way you're living makes you happyand you feel like you have a lot offreedom and you can do what you want todoum then maybe it's okay to sacrificeprivacy in some areas and that's not adetriment to your life I don't know ifsharingmy face publicly also would be adetriment to my life but because I don'tI'm not sure of the consequences I'mjustum being cautious about that but no Idon't think it's I don't think it'shypocrisyso I mean one of the things in thePrivacy circles that a lot of peopletalk about is this there's almost a memenowum I don't care about privacy because Ihave nothing to hide but what I'venoticed more myself uh through myeducation at first and talking to peopleis thatin today's age what I see more is peopleare using lots of social media you knowthey have they have their assistantdevices which are basically likewiretaps that are connected in theirhome they send their DNA places and theysay to meum Matt I'm already screwed there'sthere'snothing I can do to improve my situationwhat would you say to those peopleum I would recommend them a book calledExtreme privacy by Michael bazel becausehe actually goes through a lot of heactually like makes guides about how toremove yourself from the internet evenif you use things like Amazon and stuffhe shows you the opt-out policies thedata deletion policies which it may notbe perfectbut you definitely can do it to a degreeso I wouldn't say that there's very fewthings where there's a point ofno return where you can'tumreverse them or improve themso I definitely I don't think thatthat's a good argument becauseuh if it wasum if it was that hard to do we wouldn'tsee so much censorship on the internetwe see stuff getting taken down all thetime things getting lostso there definitely are ways touh delete yourself from the internet youcan always improve your situation yeahit's not a lost cause yeah and even ifyou can't you can also you know changeyour life move to a different locationand start fresh and if you learn aboutthe ways thatum you cannot do those things againthat's an improvement even if you knowthe the version of you that lived in theprevious place that you lived is fullydoxed you can go somewhere else andstill get a sense of safety and privacyeven if your former life doesn't havethatso one of the things that uhalways intrigued me about you is you'revery publicly proud about not carrying acell phoneuh why don't you carry yourselfeverybody carries a cell phoneyeah so again this is kind ofum sort of related tobeing a technophobeum I was one of those weird kids that itwas when it was becoming popular for youknow teenagers to have cell phones I wasnot interested in having a cell phone atall my parents actually kind of forcedit on me because they needed a way tocommunicate with me so I have I haveused phones I've used dumb phones Iactually still I've I've had so fewfilms in my life that I still have in mypossession all of the phones that I'veever usedum so I have used them but I've usedthem in very limited degreespart of that is actually not to do withprivacy it's to do with kind of thethe patterns of behavior that you getinto when you have a smartphone andyou're relying on it for everything allthe time for example I've never had theexperience oflaying in bed and reading something onmy phone or watching something I've I'vejust never used a phone in bed at alluh it's not the first thing that I lookat when I wake upum I when I go out to eat places or goshopping or meet with peopleum I am not carrying a phone I try topre-arrange plans and II've become very good at navigatingwithoutusing any kind of Internet connecteddevice to help me I use maps I use mymemoryI love to use the actual paper maps uh Ihaven't used paper Max paper maps verymuch part of that is because if you're aperson who's walking around carrying apaper mapum you get quickly targeted by peoplewho want to help you because they thinkthat you're a lost touristso I what I actually recommend to peoplewhoum if they want to stop using phones butthey need something to help withnavigation I actually recommend gettinglike a car like an auto GPS devicebecause a lot of them look like reallychunky smartphonesbut it has a limited function it tellsyou where you are and where you want toit helps you get to where you want to goso you can go around carrying a devicethat will help you navigate and it lookslike a smartphone so you won't look likea lost Taurus you'll look like everyoneelse who is using Google Maps to walkaroundum so and it doesn't have an internetconnection it's not tracking you I meanit might but like it's very limited it'slike only telling youabout locations well I know like thededicated garments don't yeahum like the maps are pre-loaded yeah youcan preload yeah you can pre-load themaps and yeah soum to yeah get back to the main threadum part of the reason I don't usesmartphones is just because I don't wantto I don't want to constantly be gettingnotifications I don't want because I'vewatched a part I've tried to actuallylearn what is the experience of like aperson who does rely on their phone andthen goes without it and it's usuallylike digital detox videos and a lot ofpeople say that they're even scared towalk out of their own house without asmartphone because they think thatthey'll get lost on the way and if theydon't have their smartphone then they'llthey'll not be able to find their wayhome and I find thatuh I find that amazing because I'venever I've never had that fear like Ipart of it is just I prepare so much butalso I just have a good understanding ofmy surroundings so if I do get lost Iknow okay I can walk to a train stationtrain stations have like area maps I canuse the area maps to get back to whereI'm familiar with the territoryum and so like navigation is one examplewhere II I don't want to rely on a smartphoneto be telling me uhthat information where without it I amlikeI'm like a ait may it basically makes me supervulnerable you would say it's like acomp It's a combination of uh privacyreasons and not wanting to be dependenton it you don't want to have thisdependence on this yeah and it's it'snot just yeah it's not just technologyeither I'm like in my daily life I trytouh with my with my dietum I I don't I avoid alcohol and drugsand basically my onlyI would say addiction is probably sugardependency because I can definitely feelwhen I haven't had sugarum what about caffeine I do not drinkcoffee no I don't drink coffee I drinkalcohol occasionally butum I used that was only sinceuh recently before that I never had itand uh that's kind of in the samecategory if I'm trying to avoid havingdependencies whereum I need to have something or itaffects my mood or my energy level andso that's all kind of in the sameterritory the the Privacy reasons fornot having a smartphoneis a very long list becauseuh smartphones have somany things in them that you do notcontrolthe hardware is unless you have like anopen sourcephone where you can actually take itapart and see how it functions there isso much happening with smartphonesthat is detrimental to your privacy likeevery time you unlock your phone it'snotifying if you have an Android phoneit's like notifying Google about yourumyour location I thinkum anduh it was once said that smartphones arebasically tracking devices that makephone calls rightum so II've there are ways that you can use asmartphone in a privacy preserving wayto a degreebut it's it's a it's I think it's muchharder than uh doing that with a laptopso I avoid smartphones as much aspossibleum yeah I mean it seems to me that yougrew up with a lot of these values Imean that you did you weren't postingpictures on social media you weren'tusing a smartphone at a young agewhen we see kids these days uh well Isound like such an old man kids thesedays uh you see a lot of kids come inthey're using social media they're usingassistance you know voice assistancethey're using iPads you go you go todinner you see a kid with an iPad at twoyears old three years oldit seems to me that it's a it's atroubling Trend do you are are youconcerned by that do you ever feel thatit's maybe a lost cause these the workyou doum and how do you how do you battle withthat like how do you battle with thefrustration of ofof this new generation coming basicallydirectly into the surveillance economyyeah it's especially difficult withchildren because I mean their parentsoftenare at an age where they didn't havethat much access to technology when theywere children and so they don'tunderstand the effects that that muchtechnology use at a young age willaffect their childrenum I'm not and I'm definitely notopposed to kids using smartphones ortablets if the purpose of it isfor example education like there aresome great educational apps that arethat can you know help them learn thingsin a very interactive and fun wayum but I think that a lot of kids arenot using these devices for Educationtheir parents give them these devicesbecause it's a good distraction it's adigital babysitterum it's a way for them to often notengage with their children and the scarypart is a lot of the time they don'teven have an awareness of who else theirchildren are engaging with when they'reusingum social media even these apps I'veseen some of the the the ads that playfor mobile games they are incrediblydisturbing I recommend like if you're ifyou're a person who's never done Mobilegaming I recommend looking up the kindsof ads that play for mobile games theyarethey are scaryum and I you know if I've seen them justby looking up like examples then I canimagine that kids who are playing thesegames are seeing them becauseum like a lot of these games you youclick a button to say yeah I'm 18 yearsoldbut of course there's no proof it'sgonna click that button yeah and I don'tknow if there should be proof I don'tthink it should be the responsibility ofthe game developer to verify a child'sage I think parents should beresponsible and like have a goodcommunication with their childum about what kinds of content they'reengaging with and when a kid gets to acertain age of course then it becomesmore their choice and they may mightmake mistakes but when you're dealingwith a child who does not understand theconsequences of their actionsum it really is the parentsresponsibility and children do notunderstand the consequences ofconstantly staring at a screen for hourson end every dayum and it's one thing for an adult to dothat and we kind of have an awareness ofhow that can affect your mental healthas an adult but when you have adeveloping child uh brain that probablyeven had like the effects are probablyof an even greater magnitudeso I'm definitely going to be the typeof parent that uhlike I I don't want to be the type ofparent that says no you absolutely can'tuse this and I just never provide it tothem I would explain to them you knowthe dangers of uh the technology thatthey want to use if they want to use itmaybe they won't maybe maybe I'll passon some privacy genes or something butum I definitely would explain to themlike here here's the reason I like forany kind of rules that I would have formy kids I would explain why I have therules that I doum and you know explain that it's aboutsafety and you know you'llto add some to some degree you'll haveto say you'll understand someday becauseyou can't explain everything to them butyeah I'm definitely worried aboutthe the current trend ofum kids using this technology and youyou can definitely tell thatyou can definitely tell that the peoplewho make it are aware of thisum because people are constantlymentioning like thethe children of like the social mediaCEOs right aren't letting that they'renot allowed to use this stuff and thatdefinitely like tells you that they'reaware that it can have negative effectswhat would you say what else what wouldyou say to parents that say you knowwe're living in an increasing DigitalWorld they don't want to you know puttheir kids at a disadvantage by keepingthem away from technologyyeah that's the other side is I mean alot of the time it's not even comingfrom the parents anymore it's comingfrom the schools a lot of the schoolsare requiringum like they're they're using Googlesystems to do like email and documentsharing and so a lot of the pressure isalso coming from the schools and theparents are being forced into it becausewe don't a lot of places don't haveschool choiceum which you know that's an aspect of itum and uh there's also countries whereyou're not even allowed to homeschool ordo any kind of alternative schoolingwhich is something that I also careabout I I definitely think it'simportant to have a choice innot only where your child gets educatedbut the kind of education that they areexposed to because I thinkum I've done a lot of research abouteducation systems and how effective theyare and especially in the US where it'svery age-restrictedand kind of assumed that because you'rethis age you should be learning thesethings and going at this pace it reallydoesn't make sense I think educationshould bemuch more individualized to the childand that children should be given morefreedom to decide actually what they'reinterested in and pursue thatum but yeah back to privacyum yeah children are reallydisadvantaged privacy wise because ofthe education systemumlikeall of their schoolwork all of theirlearning is often happening on systemsthat are surveilled and part of thereason is because schools want tosurveil children and make sure they'redoing their homework because the parentlike the parents or the community hasn'tinstilled in these kidsum oftentimes the kind ofuh they like have to kind of coerce themto get the work done they're not relyingon the kill the children having valuesof you know self-learning type valueswhichmeans that they try to solve that byimplementing surveillance systems and Ithink thatum using surveillance to solve socialissues is not a good moveyeah I mean I A lot of times I'm verygrateful that you know we were both bornin a time where uh surveillance at leastdigital surveillance wasn't soall-encompassing you know now kids arejust born basically into surveillancethey've never known anything elseespecially with the pandemic andeverything being on Zoomoh that was just like super accelerationthere and now they're talking aboutum if this you know if this happensagain if they keep doing this thenthey're they're going to try andImplement likeum software with zoom or any of theseother platforms where they actuallycheck like they read the the child'slike expression their their face and tosee if they're like paying attentionso they'reyeah I I don't like that road at all thepandemic definitely accelerated a bunchof things with surveillance andeducation that I don't like it's sointeresting because those types ofstories areit's like it's twofold it's both itmakes you frustrated uh when you work inthe Privacy space but it also at leastto me it it reaffirms why it's soimportant to to keep pushing forward andto keep trying toum at least at the very least improveeducation on that front so we have uhthis free Assange Cape behind us inframe why is this case important to youI mean in short the case is important tome because I mean it's had such animpact on my life thatum I don't think I don't think I wouldbe sitting here oron stage at Ozil Freedom Forum uh in twodays I don't think I would be in eitherof those places without uh his workbecauseum I definitely did not grow up in anenvironment whereyou know being interested in that kindof stuff was uh encouraged or evenacknowledged reallyum I was veryself-motivated to learn more about itand support itand I thinkI mean this is also a very critical timebecauseum not very long ago it became the datewhere the Home Secretary in the UK canannounce whether she approves or rejectsthe extradition request from the US andif she does approve it that's not theend of the game because they can stillappeal in the court system in the UK andthen they can appeal to the EuropeanCourt of human rights whichthe UK is still holding to even thoughthey've left the European Unionso it's a very critical time right nowbecause there's been a lot of protestsaboutthat decision because I think it stillis importantuh and but the whole thing isunfortunate in general because heshouldn't actually even be in belmarshprison right now because he technicallywon the case and most people whenyou know they win a case and then it'sbeing appealed by either sidethey are mandated to you know staywithin the state but they're not inprisonand the fact that he's in a MaximumSecurity Prison when he isn't evenaccused of a violent crime is insanelike he's sharing cells with people whohave beenaccused or convicted of terrorismum it's it's it it makes no sense froma criminal justice point of view it alsoespecially doesn't make sense becausethe work that he did exposeduh crime by very powerful states andpeople around the world and so if anyoneshould be in prison it's the people thathe exposed not himwhat would you what would you say topeoplewho say that him his work assange's workwith Wikileaks and leaking documents uhshould be considered a criminal actuhI would say that theyI mean for one the work that he didwasn't actually so different from thework that National Security journalistsand a ton of other journalists doalready the only difference is thatum most of them don't usually publishoriginal Source documents they dosometimes but not at this volumeand most people see that assomehow a worse form of Journalismbut I've always appreciated journalistswho publish their sources because itgives the reader the opportunity toverify the information for themselvesand not have to trust the person who hasyou know put it through their ownpersonal filterlike I I value the opinion much more ofpeople who say this is my interpretationof this information but if you don'tagree with that you can look at thesource documents yourself and maybe Igot it wrong maybe it says somethingelsemaybe the impact of it is differentI would also say that theone of the allegations that was made isthat the release of those documentscaused harmand both in the trial for Chelsea or thecourt martial for Chelsea Manningum that happened many years ago and evennow this case in the UK there wasopportunities for the US government tomake the case uh give evidence that harmwas caused as a result of thesedisclosures they could not cite a singleperson I think in the UK trialthey gave an example ofsomeone having to movethey had to like move out of the countryor something but that was theirreasoning yeah but no no physical harmno one diedthey did not provide a single example ofanyone getting harmon the other side what the documentsreveal is massive harm massive Carnagethat we would not even know aboutwithout these documents because the USgovernment and other stateswere actively hiding this information wewould not have any idea of the civiliancasualties from all of the wars that arebeing waged we wouldn't have an idea ofthe corruption involvedand I think the idea that we would tryto point our finger at someone like himand say you've caused harm but we haveno evidence of this and ignore theevidence of the harm that has actuallyhappenedum is uh I think it's it's simplydishonestum because the person is kind ofpresenting this argument usuallyuh implying that they care about peoplebeing harmed in my responses if you careabout people being harmed you wouldactually look at the data you wouldactually look at the source material andsee what it tells you not try tobasically put him outside the politicaltench of Journalism which means that hecan be put in prisonfor exposing crime uh having harmed nooneJanine I want to thank you again forjoining us if you could say one thing tosomeone who may not really understandthe importance of privacy and freedom intheir lives what would it beuh well I think going on for the lastquestionum part of the reasonthat I wanted to have this year todayespecially if they also free inform thembecause I'm going to be wearing it as acapeum is because the woman who came up withthe term cypherpunk Jude Millen alsoknown as Saint Jude she wrote for theoriginal Wired Magazine before it wascalled Wired Magazineum in 1993 she said another caped nerdfor peace Justice and privacyand I've always liked that phraseum and so part of the reason I am goingto wear this as a cape is because I'mkind of playing on that sloganand there's this phrase that we hear allthe time not all heroes wear capesand so I would say also not all nerdswere capesand these days a lot of a lot of Heroesinstead of wearing capes they're wearingprison jumpsuitsand as part of the foundation of Justiceis that you speak up for those who can'tspeak for themselves thenI want to wear this as a message that Iwill be or I will always try to be oneof those peopleawesome thanks Janine really appreciateit[Music]foreign",
