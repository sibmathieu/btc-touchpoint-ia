  "text": "welcome to the showthank you Marty glad to be hereLong Time Cominga lot of uhthere's a lot of I wanted to apologizethat it's taken so long but I'm gladthat we're here it's all good betterlate than nevera lot of chatter on Twitter about thisdiscussionI've been trying to think of how toframe it I think the easiest way is justto begin with the simple question isBitcoin violenceso I stopped using that word over a yearagobecause I don't think it's a productivewordand I actually changedhow I talked about it so anytime someonebrings that up they're they're talkingabout something I haven't said for overa yearbut I'm happy to talk about why I saidthat yeah what I guess why did you saywhy is it not violence or why isviolence not a productive wordyeah soso I'm the military dude and the waythat the military especially the U.Smilitary uses that word ismore so associated with how the Frenchuse that word back duringthe early days of the United States sowhen thewhen the French military was kind of thedominant global Militaryand back in those daysviolence was essentially a word thatmeant to bring Force at somethingso it's a combination of whis from Latinand pharaohso you combine those together it's tobring Force at somethingand so really when it comes to themilitary usage of that term what itessentially means is to bring Force atsomething for the sake of imposing aphysical costso the whole thing with NationalSecurity or any type of militarycampaign is that the way that youachieve security is by imposing physicalconstraints or an easy way to thinkabout it is every single animal orperson or Nation or group of people orwhatever you want to try to defendhas a benefit to cost ratio of attackwhere the they have some benefit toattacking and some cost of attackingand so the purpose of violence in thistheology is to increase that denominatoryou want to increase the physical costof attacking you so that you can dropyour benefit to cost ratioand so that's kind of how the U.S usesthe term and how theyhow we think about it it's it's notreallyuh it's not how the public thinks aboutit and especially how the an Englishuses it because in the English terms ofviolence it means basically to causeharm so likeit's like a catch-all word for like allthings badis violence like every bad thing you canthink of is bad whereas in the militaryterm it's to project power to impose aphysical cost in order to lower yourbenefit to cost ratio of attack it's notexplicitly to cause harm or to causeinjurythat is the side effect of imposingphysical costs does that make sense yepyeahso so so being the military guy who hasalmost no experience talking to thepublicI made the genius uh assertion on myfirst day on Twitterthat thinking okay well the whole pointof Bitcoin is to impose a physical costto secure your access to a piece ofproperty by lowering the benefit to costratio attacking you right you can'tachieve centralized Control AuthorityOver The Ledger because it is toophysically costly to do so so all theseminors are imposing a real worldphysical cost measurable in Wattstoto make it impossible to justify thephysical cost of attacking you and so tomein my limited smooth brain military mindthat to me looks like digital a digitalform of violence so I said Bitcoin isdigital violence it's taken the samephysical power projection game ofimposing physical costs on people forthe sake of Defending Yourself byby lowering your benefit to cost ratioof attack physically but it's doing thatin a digitized form so I said digitalviolence and that was a trigger word andthat took off and I still have yet toactually match the number of Impressionsthat tweet has made so most people onlythink about me for that tweetand howso you got past youbrought your military perspective tobitcoin saw hash rate andthe the cost that an immense amount ofhash rate could uh potentially be thruston a potential attacker at the mininglayer as violence decided that wordwasn't uh apt for this particularno asset so what is it I think a lot ofwhatpeople are worried about with theparticular framing they've been puttingforth recently is trying to pigeonholeBitcoin into a weapons-grade cybersecuritytool that should be thrust uh into thesecond amend or their production shouldbe thrust on the network via the SecondAmendmentwhy is it yeah that's the idea and Iknow that gets a lot of flack butum I think it's a logical approachand I don't think it'sum as radical as it soundsI also think it's a technically accurateapproachand I'm happy to talk through that tooif you'd like yeah let's talk through itOkay soI guess I think a useful starting pointhere isto think about the history ofactually we could go back I was going tostart in cryptography but let's go backfurther let's go back beforeanyone had discovered electricityso actually let's go back 10 000 yearsto the emergence of physical powerprojection and power Dynamic Dynamics inagrarian societyso generally speaking if you want tojust give like a general description ofwarfarewhat kind of seems to happen is thatpeople don't want to use physical poweras the basis through which they settledisputes or determine control authorityover resources orestablish consensus or achieve consensuson the quote-unquote legitimate state ofownership and chain of custody ofproperty people do not want to usephysical power as the basis for doingthat for obvious reasons it costs a lotof energy but it also harms people itcauses injury directlysoagrarian society in their capacity inpeople's capacities for abstractthinking try to come up withalternatives to using physical power asthe basis for settling disputes andthat's what gives rise toabstract power hierarchies orgovernments or any form of likeadjudication mechanism or some guy withimaginary power gets to decide whohow the dispute goes and so that's kindof the basis for mostmost governments is just this idea thatwe can figure out a way to do all thesethings to manage our resources toestablish a pecking order to solvedisputes in somequote unquote none I won't say violentanymore but non-physical powerprojection wayokay so there's Merit to thatif you have a trustworthy governmentespecially then that can work theproblem isgovernments are demonstrablyuntrustworthy anytime an abstract powerhierarchy is formedit becomes systemically vulnerable toexploitation and abuse people abusetheir abstract powerabstract power has a lot of uh justgeneral disadvantages compared to usingphysical power the the big ones beingit's trust-based so you have to trustthe person with abstract power not toabuse it against you it's rank based soit's in egalitarian not everyone hasaccess to itum it's permission based it's justit has a bunch of flaws that make itsystemically exploitable and at the endof the day it's fundamentally a beliefsystem there is really no such thing atleast in physical reality asthe government you can't touch thegovernment it's a belief system peopleare just agreeing in this higher powerand going along with itokay so if agrarian society start to dothat thenthat's cool that if the government'strustworthy that's cool but they theybreak downum so you have you have to get back tothe benefit to cost ratio of attackproblem the more successful an abstractpower our hierarchy is the moreresources that those people withabstract power can control there's amore benefit to gaining that control orexploiting that control so there's abenefit to attackand the less a population is willing toresist against that the cost ofattacking them is is dropping and so nowthe benefit to cost ratio of attackingor systemically exploiting a populationat at a large scale through their beliefsystem is actually increase the benefitto cost ratio of attacking thatincreases as they adopt these abstractpower hockeys if they do nothing to keeptheir government accountableand so that's bad because you'reinviting systemic exploitationalternatively another thing that couldhappen is people becomeessentiallyumpacifist they they get so comfortable intheir well-functioning government thatthey forget that there's a lot ofgovernments that there's Genghis Khanand Hannibal and Napoleonyou know neighboring themand if they do nothing to physicallydefend their abstract power hockey orwhatever resources they controlthey make themselves vulnerable toinvasionso either way if you forfeit yourcapacity and inclination to to projectphysical power you're going to either besystemically exploited at a massivescale through your belief systems oryou're going to be invaded and so wehave10 000 years of empirical records toshow that and then 5 000 years of ofwritten testimony to say that that'sjust kind of how it works and then thisis a recurring problem people adoptthese abstract power hierarchiesthey eventually get their benefit tocost ratio eventually climbs they theystart to get exploited they have arevolution or Civil War or they havethey get invaded War breaks outpeople become inclined to projectphysical power they're inclined toaccept the downsides of the energyrequired or the injury risks that you doand then that cycle just repeats itselfover and over and over again so there'sthis like unfortunatecomplex emergent property whereironically in agrarian societies attemptto adopt systems that don't use physicalpower as the basis to settle disputesand establish resource Control Authorityand Achieve consensus on the legitimatestate of ownership and chain of custodyof propertyin their efforts to not use physicalpower as the basis for doing that theyadopt imaginary power hierarchies theyadopt belief systems which aresystemically exploitableand then that breaks out eventually inyet another war and that just keeps oncompounding and compounding over timeuntil we get towhere we are today well as that processhas been going on for thousands of yearshumans have been doing their thing thatthey do best andmaking increasingly clever and efficientways to project physical powerso if you look at all the weapons of warover the past ten thousand years you cansee that what a trend and what humansare effectively doing is getting moreand more efficient at projectingphysical powerlarge quantities of physical power andwatts can be projected on people in thiscase it's kinetic power so it's Forceagainst Massand they can do it for Less size weightand energy requirements so they'regetting and money requirements sothey're getting more efficient atprojecting powerso ironicallyagrarian society has become so efficientat playing the kinetic power projectiongame that they got to the point wherethey have nuclear weapons and they riskMutual Annihilation so like we're now atan existential threat where it's like wecan't actually use our most efficientpower projection Technologies becauseiconoclastically it'sinefficient it's too efficient to beuseful because if we usedyou know if we went on a peer-to-peerstrategic level Warfare with nuclearweapons that would not be winnable itwould be too costly in terms of liveslost so it may be efficient in terms ofhow many watts you can projectfor how cheap but it's actuallyinefficient and how many lives lostokay so that's a problem because ifagrarian society must continue toeffectively revert back to thesephysical power projection games to kindof resettle their disputes andre-establish consensus on the legitimatestate of ownership and chain of custodyof the resourcesthen that could be a problem and and onething I wanted to note about that is ifyou zoom out and you look at humans fromlike an alien point of view and you lookdown at all the resourceswhat you'll notice is that it isprecisely because of this global scalephysical power projection competitionthat has been waged for the last10 000 yearsthat control authority overEarth's resources is decentralizedso the the complex emergent socialbenefit of warfare is thedecentralization of control authorityover resourceswe have 195 different countries with a195 neatly defined and well-defendedbordersand so the abstract power the imaginarypower of these people that are in chargeof these governments cannot expandprecisely because they're physicallyconstrained from expanding and anytimesomeone tries to effectively 51 percentattack the Earth's global resources ifthey want to pull a Genghis Khan or poola Hitlerand try to project a whole bunch ofphysical power to try to physicallycapture resourcesthey get constrained it's really hard tosustain thateveryone kind of Unites against them andmake sure they can't 51 percentattack the resources and so that'snoteworthy because what we're showinghere is there areimplications of warfare as effectively aproof-of-work protocol it is a way forpeople to engage in a global scalephysical power competitionto achieve decentralized controlauthority over our physical resourcesand up until the event uh the inventionof like computers and electricity andstuff that was purely kinetic so it'spurely forces against massesbut it was still a power projection gameand I think so that's just worth notingnowwhat I'm describing is what Tesladescribed in in 1900he he you know had that essay theproblem with increasing human energy orsomething like to that effect any and hebasically said we're getting tooefficient at uhdoing this power projection gamethat the in-state of this is people aregoing to have to basically take humansout of the loop and let machines engagein energy competitions with each otherbecause if you go if you continue to godown the kinetic routehe says that's just going to be toodestructive so he was a sin he was kindit sounds like he was predictingmutually assured destruction 40 yearsbefore the invention of of nuclearweapons and he was actually inventingthis before both world wars beforeairplanes before aerial bombardment anda lot of thethe law of the nastiness that played outright after he made those predictionsbut the bottom line is he predicted thateventually humans would become sodestructive with their physical powerprojection technologies that they wouldhave to turn to this like machine likeapparatus where these machines competeagainst each other using some energycompetition and like the way the windthe energy competition is one way to doit is to become more efficientso I say all that becausethat makes sense fromfrom kind of just a big picture ahead inthe cloud level and and we see it playout at the nuclear strategic levelnow some will say wellwe're not actually strategicallystalemated at a global levelbecause there's other ways that you canproject physical power and you seeit all over the news right you still seepeople using kinetic power and engagingin competitions with each otherthe the issue with that is we actuallydon't know if that can solve a strategiclevel policy disputebecause it's only been asymmetricthere's never been two nuclear powers togo up go head-to-head with each other sowe don't actually know if we could usethese deliberately inefficient ways ofprojecting kinetic power to solve adispute and it's worth noting that it'swe governments are deliberately choosingan inefficient way to project kineticpower to it to engage in thiscompetition because they know theNuclear One the most efficient one is istoo ironically too expensive to useand soum okay but if you pull that threadlet's say it let's say two nuclearPowers go to war against each other theychoose inefficient power projectiontechnology so non-nuclear Warfare as themechanism and they use just traditionalmunitionsum if you assume that they couldactually solve that dispute withoutescalation to the nuclear level which Ipersonally don't think but who knowsthen the problem with that approach iswhat you're going to do is agrariansociety is going to continue coming upwith increasingly cleverways to project kinetic powerefficiently at each otherso what that means is they're just goingto discover another way to mutuallyassure destructionso right now the only way that we canmutually assure destruction is throughis through nuclear weapons but if wecontinue this non-nuclear kinetic powerprojection game we're already seeingthat Trend it's becoming humans out ofthe loop it's becoming drones fightingdrones it's becoming swarms of dronesfighting drones and maybe in the futureit could be something like AI powereddrone swarms just like TerminiTerminator style Skynet StyleMass drone Warfare and so it's so thepoint is just because wehave temporarily found a way to engagein physical power competitions toattempt to settle disputesdoesn't mean that that mechanism can'talso meet the same in that nuclearwarfare has which is effectively astalemate we it's we've we justlike we would will probably go extinctif we tried to do a full-scale strategicnuclear warokayso why do I say that well becauseumfortunatelytheyou know if you go back to Einstein hesays well matter is swappable withenergyokay so instead of projecting Power bydisplacing the piece of matter across adistance you can project Power bypassing a charge across a resistorso you can produce Watts electronicallyand it's physical power so you can dothis in a permissionless way you can dothis in an egalitarian way people canaccess their Watts all across the worldand so then the idea iswell what ifwhat if agrarian society learned how toengage in a global physical powercompetition electronicallyrather than kineticallyso you would still get the benefits ofphys using physical power as the basisto settle disputes andachieve consensus on the legitimatestate of ownership in China custody ofproperty and determine control authorityover resources butyou would do it in a way that couldactually be oneso you could actually win a physicalpower competitioninstead of just stalinating it therewould be a clear winner there would beclear losers and and so for that reasonit's actually usefuland so that's interesting okay so thenwe then you have to start thinking rightin the future if we ever did need to getinto some massive level strategic Warfightumis it reasonable to expect it to be akinetic fightif we know that's already stalematedor is it reasonable to expect it to be anon-kinetic power projection competitionglobal scale Warand then back to my earliest pointifnuclear superpowers are stalematedagainst each other then that doubles asa stalemate between the ruling class ofthose superpowers and the ruled classso you've created a massive asymmetrybetween the nuclear the nuclear-poweredruling class and the non-nuclear-powereduh ruled class and sojust like it has been for the last 10000 yearsthere it is very possible thatit's it's very logical to believe that astalemate at this level represents amajor systemic security hazardof Oppression notNations fighting against each other butNations oppressing their own classesbecause their own own classes their ownpopulace has no real realistic way tostand up to a nuclear-powered stateand so add all these things togethermaybe the future of War wouldn't bemaybe it's not reasonable to believethat the future War would be a kineticWar because that's a war that isincreasingly less likely to be winnablemaybe it's not likely that the futureglobal war would be a war between statesmaybe it would be a war between theruled class and the ruling classand it's very plausible to believe thatit would bean electronic Waror something using a non-kinetic form ofpowerand so you add those together and it'slike okay well what would that look likeif how would that work what would itlook like and so that's kind of whereyou start getting towards Bitcoin butI'll stop there if you have anyquestions thanks for letting me talk solong noumyeah I guess the big question isin terms of like the history of warfareand these hierarchiesthat have been erected that's that's whyI've been drawn to bitcoin why I likeBitcoin it allows us to get awayfrom these uh these hierarchicalstructures that are thrust onto people throughout the world and itjust allows us to opt out and use thispeer-to-peer digital cache system tocooperate maybe yes compete on the openmarket to provide goods and services buthaving a a global sound monetarystandard which will allow us tocoordinate and settle that competitionvia the free marketyes solet's sayum where20 or 30 years afterthe invention of nuclear weapons so theinvention of kinetic power projectiontechnology that's effectively tooefficient to useand we have created if we just assumefor the sake of argument that we havecreated a hazardous situation wheregovernments are asymmetrically powerfulagainst their own peoplethenumsituations like or Technologies likecryptographyrepresenta way for people to secure themselvesagainst systemic exploitation and abusefrom their own governmentsand I think that was the originalargument with all the crypto Wars andthe drama with uh Zimmerman and andand pgp and all that stuff is if youlook back and just kind of read aboutthat stuffthe core argument the kind ofoverarching likeethos of that of that time period wasthis is a type of technology that we canuse to secure ourselvesagainst systemic exploitation so in thiscase specifically Mass surveillanceagainst our own asymmetricallyoverpowered governmentand Zimmerman it seemed like people likehim and the and the cypherpunks werereallytrying to empowerthe publicto have this access to this technologyand soit it has very second amendment likeundertones to it right it's not thefirst time I have a rightyes well yes somy argument it's bothbut my main argument is firstamendment's weak Second Amendment strongsobut if we go back to that before thewhole First Amendment thing popped upreally it's like okay people here is awhat the government defines asmilitary-grade munitionsthat people can have access to thatpeople want to have access toso they can secure themselves againstsystemic exploitation abuse from theirown government and the problem was thatgovernment was trying to prohibit themfrom doing that that's what made peopleso angry it's heyif there is some non-lethalway that I can secure myself against theasymmetric power of you then I deserveto have access to that like what is thewhy should I not have access to that andwhy would you stop me and that was oneof the main big undertones of thatmovement and I know that the angle thatZimmerman took and especially the publictook to support him was to make theargument that heyRSA encryption is is is code code isspeech people have the right to freespeech this is unconstitutional and Iknow that like MIT pressprinted out RSA code on like their andthen like exported it just to like outof solidarity and the people would weartheir shirts toobut while the although the public wasreally pushing the First Amendmentargument I think that the SecondAmendment argumentwas also a strong argument that couldhave been takenandandas that case was going forward and asthe Zimmerman's legal defense was kindof starting to pressure thethe government on thatthey backed off real fast so it'simportant to point out that it wasalthough they tried to play that heyyou're violating the export Control Actby exporting this what we Define asMunitions as soon as the public startedpushing back on them they backed offreal fast that case was never settledand and then follow-on cases because ofthe popularity of the First Amendmentargument follow-on cases were prettyable to like set the formal precedentthat speech represents codepeople have a right to free speech etcetc but thenbut you know for sure we know for surethat it wasn't just the first amendmentargument because of the Clipper chipdebacleso when after the Zimmerman case NSA waslike okay fine you can have yourencryption you can have your free speechuse our Clipper chipbut that was encryption technology thathad a back door to it it allowed the NSAto bypassthe keys and look at everyone's messagesencrypted messages and so policy makerstry to argue it's like hey you can haveyour free speechand you can have your encryption justuse this encryption and the publicraised hell gave him the big middlefinger why because the pointis not just free speech it is the rightto be secure against exploitation of myown government so Clipper chip stillgives the government the means to massPrevail me or toexploit me another way so it's likeclearly not just a First Amendment likeangle because if it were then peoplewouldn't have been so upset about theClipper chip and then fast forward threeyears finally we get to executive order130 46 for whatever it was 1996 whenBill Clinton essentially changed therules and and how the rules work is notnecessarily that cryptography is nolonger considered munitionshow it works isthe secret squirrels do the they developthe encryption technology and thenessentially the president decides whichof that technology to release to thepublic so it's like when you know whenmilitary grade encryption starts when itthat baby is born it begins as amunition and then by some internal legalprocess it's popped over to theDepartment of Commerce or something andthen it's publishedand it is be precisely because of thatVictory because we were able to convincethe government to allow the public tohave this security technology which theyDefine as weapon grade munitionto allow the public to have access tothis security technology explicitly forthe case of defending the the publicagainstsystemic exploitation abuse from theirown government that we have shot 256that shop 2 was published by the NSA in2001 so this this battlethat was fought is the precursor to thecore enabling technology of of Bitcoinand Bitcoin relies exclusively on Shot 256 right nowwhich was by the own government'sadmissionMunitions that the public ought to haveokayI'll stop there any questions so farno questions a couple comments goingback to Second Amendment stronger thanthe first amendment I would disagreewith that and thenonsort of building on what you just saiduhI think this proves it like that likeyes we canwe can agree that encryption was definedas Weapons grade Munitions by thegovernment but I think why they had toallow Zimmerman and Company uh succeedin getting pgp into the hands of thepublic is because at the end of the daycode is Free Speech it is uh simply textand there's a more recent precedent thatdoesn't involve cryptography at all itreally drives this point home and that'sdefense distributed which one a massivecase uh and basically got their filesthat allow people to print to 3D printactual physical Munitions that can harmpeoplein the real world they got that definedas speech and so that's the firstamendment is the base layer they have toallow these Technologies because at theend of the day they are software theyare code they are text they are speechyeah sowe have toso my argument is not that the firstamendment is we that we should continuethat we should not continue to use theFirst AmendmentI think that's still a good angleI don'tI think there are a lot of ways that thegovernment could and hasusedum like public health emergencies orsome you know it's important for thepublic safety measuresto prohibit this type offree speechand so my concern is that if you look atlike the ESG movementthat is greasing the skids to make itpolitically feasible to sayBitcoin is bad for the environmentand therefore it's basically greasingthe skids to do another Clipper chipwhere you can try to convince the publicall right you can have yourcryptocurrency but just not Bitcoinbecause bitcoin's bad for theenvironment there's a public safetyconcern there that's usually the publicsafety angle is usually thejustification forwhy speech is prohibited like whatconstraints can be applied to freespeech and so that's concerning becauseyou can see themclearly starting to try to grease thoseskits there's clearly like this campaignto Market Bitcoin as quote unquote apublic health hazard because it'scausing you know it's boiling the oceansor whateverandand so that's just worth considering nowanother I would argue there is we'regoing to destroy ESG ESG is killingitself we actually don't even need todestroy it we're finding out in realtime that the policies that have beenenacted due to ESG or like-minded ideasseeping into the public policy spherehave made life materially worse off forthe people who have been subjected tothose policies obviously what's going onin Europe with their energy crisis herein the United States and California withtheir energy crisis with the E it'sbecoming very obvious that thesepoliciesdo not work and do not benefit humansand Humanity overall and then you get tothe S and the G and Sam bankman freedhad a higher sscore in the ESG then then Exxon C CEOCEO and it's proving that it's all LARPand you get into like the woke boardrooms and stuff like that and and peopleyes they can grease these wheels theycan try but economic reality and socialreality is beginning to really rear itshead and prove that this stuff does notbenefit humans at the end of the dayyeah soumand especially like in TexasI think there's a Herculean effortthat's working on helping people see theclear benefits to the gridand the optimization of of Bitcoin andI'veum I think I've been able to help policymakers see that in a different way tooum that's definitelythat's definitely a good angleokayumthere'sthere's another issue too which is thecrypto attacksoI think that with the cbdcs and withlike uh proof of stake systems and allthis other crapthatthat attack Vector is effectively are-emergence of the Clipper chip ideawhere it's like okay convince the publicthat they can have this cryptographictechnology so long as it's the one thatwe have the back door access to sothat's really what cbdc's inproof mistake represent is here's a youknow decentralized in here's a Dynosystem that we really do have onimpeachable control authority overdespite how muchwe put people to yeah to LARP about itright like POS is a POSum but people don't see that and and thethe long con is to say well it's gotcrypto in it so it's got the samesecurity as crypto as like you knowBitcoin so you should you should valuethat but what they're missing isthe importance of not just cryptographybut the importance ofum of digital power of being givingpeople the means to impose large sums ofphysical power against each other infrom through cyberspace for the sake ofmaking it too physically prohibitive tosystemically exploit the protocolso so like proof of so for exampleBitcoinum I my new favorite saying now is tosay that Bitcoin is proof of proof ofwork workingand so if you want to make peopleunderstand likethe value of Bitcoin as a securitytechnology they have to understand thevalue of proof of work which means theyhave to understandpower dynamics and the benefit to costratio of attacksituations and how enabling a globalSociety to engage in a global scalephysical power competition creates thecomplex emergent benefit ofdecentralizing control authority overthe underlying resourceum so you you when I when you explainWarfare you're explaining proof of workand when um but just in a andtraditionally it's kinetic but now itcould be it might be becomingElectricokay so let's say for the sake ofargumentlike I understand that the concern isthis could givepoliticians and attack Vector on bitcointo say and to reattempt the same attackright say this is munitionsand try to ban people from it is do Ihave that right is that the main concernthat you haveyeah I mean certainly if the governmentespecially considering again going backto like I don't believe the SecondAmendment is as strong as the firstamendment particularly right nowin 2022 Americauh if you somehow get Bitcoin deemed asmilitary-grade Munitions it seems thatthe administration that's in place andmany that have come before it or arehell-bent on uh taking away gunsparticular types of guns right now andif that erosion around the security ofthe Second Amendment continues movingforward it's easy to see firstly takeyour AR-15s and then they take away yourability to to holdBitcoin to mine Bitcoin to run a fullnode to validate Bitcoin which gets backto anotheruh topic that we really have to touch onis what provides security to the BitcoinNetwork because I thinkthat's one of the assumptions thatyou've been running with that I woulddisagree with is that hash power createssecurity for the network when it'sreally the individuals runningthe consensus rules on their own fullnodes to have the power at the end ofthe dayyeah I know there's the ongoingumthere's the block size Wars and thatdebateI don't think we can I don't think wecan know yet for sureum I I think it's probably like a checksand balance thing I think it's probablya combination of bothum the the only way we're really gonnawe would really know is ifif Bitcoin got 51 attacked would thenotes be able toinvalidate block out of itI mean the nuclear option is to to forkand change theconsensus algorithm move away from shockyeah so like adopt a different like uhyeah adopt the different cryptography sothat's true butthat net wouldn't necessarily stop thethe vulnerability you would just have anew chain with the same vulnerabilitylike you could the the same type ofattack could repeat itself if you Forkyeah and does that make senseit doesum certainly and that's why it's anuclear option you don't want to do itobviously this topic came upa lot in the summer 2017 leading up tothe failure of segwit 2x which had 90 ofhash rate signaling for itum but then you get into like the wholewhat is my again mining is a businessright like individuals take Capital riskto they need money toget these assets too and then find cheapenergy to plug them in and hopefullymake a profit margin not only is it abusiness it's an extremely ruthless oneand I do think we have analogs fromhistory that provethatum it's probably not wise forgovernments tooembark on these types of Endeavorsbecause it's it's very well suited forthe uh the private sector andentrepreneurs as opposed to a monolithicgovernment and then I want to talk aboutthat too but let's wait because thisbecause that's a separate train ofthought yes but we have analogs in termsofa nation or a group of people havingcontrol of the production of a commoditysimilar to bitcoin golduh that really don't have anycontrol over the gold markets or don'thave a lot of gold at all so like inninth or 20th centurySwitzerland amassed a a large Trove ofgold they have a ton of gold they'venever produced gold in their lifewhereas Uganda has produced throughoutthe 20th century produced immenseamounts of gold but doesn't hold any sothey they had the power of theproduction but they were no better offuh at the end of the day because theydidn't actually hold the asset smartercountries like Switzerland just realizedthat gold at the time was the bestmonetary asset that existed on theplanet and accumulated itthey didn't need to dogold mining to to accumulate that typeof welfare that type of power that thatwealth eventually gave them and theabilityfor them to become one of the wealthiestNations on the planetyeah and I thinkumI think the way that I differ a lot fromso I I tell people on Twitter that I'mnot I don't consider myself a BitcoinMaxi I consider myself a proof of workMaxiebecause I try to to stay true to theidea of Bitcoin being a reusable proofof work system and that there could beother use cases for reusable proofs ofwork Beyond specifically serving as afantastically secure base layer monetarysystem that would be very secure againstsystemic exploitation and abusivepeople who control computersum and so that kind of is like I take adifferent approach to to thinking aboutthat kind of stuff and I thinkum a lot of people doyeah I mean I I wouldn't argue thatthere aren'tother work other use cases for proof Imean the original use case approval workwas email spamprotectionum Adam back did not have a difficultyadjustment so it turned out not to be uhas useful as it was when it originallylaunched but again I think thatthat's tangential toBitcoin I think Bitcoin leverages proofof work certainlyum but again it brings back to the realvalue of Bitcoin whyI'm a quote unquote Bitcoin Maxi this isIam a monetary Maxi as well I believethathumans once they come into contact witha really good money are going tochoose to use that money over others andthat's basically the the ball thatSatoshi started rolling in Januaryof 2009um and I see thatfree market money as being a way to optout of the bloated federal governmentsystem that exists all throughout theworld and will allow individuals likeyou and meto coordinateand to accumulate wealths to coordinateeconomic economic activity and reinvestin the economy like I don't I don't seethe need for nation states to spin uphash forces and do all this the freemarket economies already done anincredible job of building outthe infrastructure of the BitcoinNetwork whether it be full nodes fullnode software full node devices whetherit be mining A6 energy contracts energyinfrastructurefree market is has taken care of thatprettypretty miraculously and prettyincredibly in the first 14 years at thenetwork has existedso I can give you an alternativeperspective if you're interested let'sdo itumasnuclear weapons were being designedso too were the first operationallyproven general purpose State machinesAKA modern day computersin fact the first operational generalpurpose State machine the first programsthat it was running when it was it wasat Harvard it's the Harvard mock onemark oneamong the first programs that it wasrunning was the design for thedetonation device for the for theManhattan Projectso Von Newmanum was coming here in into Cambridge toreplug thethe transistors or the the plug Boardsof this computer in order to have it runthe program to design the bombs or justsee what's the best like implosionmechanismanyways the point isum as humans were kind of starting toget to the point where they'reprojecting kinetic power to to the pointwhere it's too devastating they're alsostarting to create this the verybeginnings of what would become the nowvirtual reality we know as cyberspaceand really what computers represent is abelief systemit's we choose to assign symbolicmeanings to State changes in a statemachineand we choose to abstract that at higherand higher levels we started withmachine code where we're just usingBoolean logic to convert State changesto to information ones and zeros andthen that scaled up to Assembly Languageand that scaled up to general purposelanguage and and now we don't even talkabout software as if it'sa general purpose language anymore wetalk about software at such an abstractlevel that we call it things like coinsorthumbnails or clouds is it a beliefsystem or is itI mean it's object like you put ininputs and you get objective outputs isthat yeah or is that isn't yeah isn't itweird so so this gets to like the coremind-blowing pieces of like computerscience which isthe machines are obviously real themachines in front of us and the statechanges that that we can see in front ofus in this and this array of lightemitting diodes that we're using to talkto each other and the like that'sobviously something real and sharedobjective physical reality but the waythat is being presented to you is thathumans effectively inventeda symbolic language a syntactically andsymbolically complex language calledmachine codeand learn to apply that symbolic meaningto I wish I had a I usually have like aprop for this here we goso here's ayou see thisyouso this is a state mechanism right it'sgot two stateson and offokay this is a state mechanism the statespace istwo statesso what humans decided to do is theydecided to call that State Oneand that state zeroso they digitized a state change in astate mechanismso the the state thing that this is realright this is clearly a state and thisis clearly not a statebut this is not one this is not zero weare applying that meaning to the statechangeif that makes sense it's a symbolicwe're using our prefrontal cortex is toimply symbolic meaning to a state changeand we're choosing to decide what we'revolunteering to decide to call that oneand call that zeroand that's a machine code in a nutshellit's just this mind-bendingly miraculousthing where we can assign symbolicmeaning to State changes in a statemachineand then with general purpose storedprogram computers that Von Neumann andthe people invented in the 40swhat they figured out how to do wasstore information so store State changesas information within machines and thenhave those machines recursively runoperations on their own instructions sowhen a computer programmer is likeprogramming a computerthey're essentially justconverting State changes intoinformation and having the computerthey're basically created a way forhumans to speak to machines and then formachines to then take that informationand then speak back to humansand so you're having a computer speaktheir machine code but then translate itback to the symbolic language that youcan understand or in some way that youcan understand so what you see in frontof you is what has been programmed tolook like what you normally see in frontof you but really all you're doing isjust looking at a light emitting anarray of light emitting diodes it's likeyou don't know for sure that I'm realif that makes sense you just know basedoff of where we are in technology andand howhow kind of like your own kind ofexperiential knowledge thateven though all you are doing is lookingat a computer screen right now I'mprobably realI know it's trippy it's computer scienceis pretty miraculous are you an AIyes to be determined I no one so youhaven't seen me around right like I'venot we have not been in personyeah so I could be and even if we hadhow could I know this isn't a deep fakebut that's truebut how does this pertain to Bitcoin inits natureyeah sosoumwe have two parallel pathsthat are developing people can no longerumuse kinetic powerbut at the same time people are learningways to apply symbolic meaning to Statechanges and they're becomingincreasingly more important or betterfaster cheaper computersbetter you know slower size weight andpower requirements more efficientComputing requirementspeople have figured out how to applysymbolic meaning to all sorts ofphysical state changes in in the worldaround us anything that can change itsphysical state can be a computeror can send digital information that'swhy we have things likewireless internet because what thecomputer does is they change Statechanges in electromatic waves they applysymbolic meaning to thoseto this phase and frequency andamplitude and stuff like thatum and so you can digitize State changesin the environment to sendinformation wirelessly from one computerto other so the point is you can changeany physical phenomenon into informationokaywell we at this point we're getting sogood with that like we have photoniccomputers now where we're sending laserlike we're transmitting informationthrough laser lightso you can change all the same stuffwith normally with electromagneticradiationum and it's becoming super efficient youcan send a lot of data like the fastestcomputer chip right now can send theentire internet's worth of data withinlike three secondsokay what has been unspoken thisunspoken engineering assumption thatpeople have been tacitly makingthat people have not been admitting tois that they are believing that moreefficient Computing is betterthey believe that it is virtuous tobuildState changing mechanisms where the thetransistor states are cheaper andcheaper and cheaper to change requireless and less energy or smaller andsmaller and smallerthat's what's driving likethe performance of AI and stuff it'sjust so cheap so small that you can haveyour Nvidia 380 3080 and run like Raytracing on Call of Duty and stuff likethatokay well what people aren't asking iswhat if you did the oppositewhat if you tried to create a computerthat has very difficult to change Stateslike it takes a lot of power to changestateum what would be the advantages of thatand sothis is where it comes back down tobitcoin becauseI think a lot of the reason why people Ithink a lot of the reason why I have avery different perspective of Bitcointhan most people is becauseI do not look at Bitcoin as aninnovation in softwareI look at Bitcoin as an in an innovationin the base layer of the tech stack itis a fundamentally different base layerState changing mechanismto where today we're not just using ourwhat we know as our regular computerswe're not just using floating gatetransistors as the state changingmechanism through which weuse our software program stuff I thinkwhat proof of work does at thefundamental levelis change quantities of electric powerand use quantities of electric power asthe state changing mechanism of thecomputer so that's just a complicatedcomputer science engineer nerd way ofsaying that we're effectively turningthe global scale electric power gridinto the base layer computerreturning the world the entire globalscale electric power grid into a baselayer State mechanism and then pluggingit into the internetand then the question that's like themind-blowing that's like kind of likethe big thing about my thesis is ifthat's true then it's like holy crapthat's pretty mind-blowing what wouldthe benefits of that beand the benefits of that would be is youhave a computer that isglobally decentralized like the computerthe the the global electronic grid isthe motherboardthat is the thing that's storing theinformationand the physical change the statechanging mechanism is quantities ofphysical power not transistor Statechanges like on our computer chips andhere but quantities of physical Powerand electric grid is what we're implyingBoolean logic toso we're converting quantities ofphysical power into bits and then we'resending those bits back into cyberspaceso to me I see Bitcoin as bit powerwe're converting power itself quantitiesof physical power drawn from theglobally decentralized electric powergrid into bits into information that canthen be transferred through the throughcyberspace I'll stop thereand again I would push back again Ithinkthemisconception is that like the miningcontrols the network where it's the fullnodes where in that scenario just laidout likeif you think of like a world computerand you're pulling hash rate off soyou're using less electricity one wouldthink if it is the mining industry isthe the motherboard the base load thatit's being deprecated but that's why thedifficulty adjusts and really themotherboard the basslayer of the global computer if we'regoing to use that analogy is thedistributed Ledger and its history assecured by full notesyeah soummaybe we should go back to the data filethat's not really the electricityor the gridso let's go back to FinneyFinney makes reusable proofs of workconverting if we just assume I'm rightfor a second just for the sake ofargumentconverting quantities of electric powerinto informationthat you can choose to call you canchoose to call these bits of informationyou can choose to abstract them as coinsor in his case reusable proofsa challenge with Finney'sefforts was that it still essentiallyrelied onthe a pretty much a trusted server likea centralized serverright and sothe one of the big changes betweenFinney's approach andum satoshi's approach was okay takereusable proofs of work this whole ideabut you don't want to have to rely on acentralized server to manage thatbecause then you had to trust in thatserver andthat's not a very trust is not a verygood security protocol right you couldeasily be exploited by thatum and sohe he his approach of course obviouslywas to use a distributed network but ofcourse and so there's your notes theproblem of course with using distributednetworks as you run into the Byzantinegenerals problem rightuh where how do you get all theseglobally distributed nodes to achieveconsensus on the legitimate state ofownership and chain of custody of thereusable proofs of workso like yeah you can haveum I think you're right that distributednodes are a linchpin and a core part ofthe technology and definitely a corepart of decentralizationbut but it's also true that it's notjust the decentralization of nodesit'sum it's decentralization of controlauthority over The Ledger I iev quoteunquote legitimate state of ownershipand chain of custody of the reusableproofs workso that's just a long way of saying isto solve the Byzantine generals problemit looks to me my argument is it looksto me that Satoshi effectively inventedsoft War a soft form of global scalephysical power projection where peoplecan compete for Control Authority OverThe Ledger the right to add transactionsto the block rightum but because that's a it doesn't givethem control over The Ledger thoughso if you have the ability to addtransactions to The Ledgerthen you have the ability to withholdtransactions from The Ledger so that's atacit denial servicevulnerability right likethat's the problem with proof of stakeone of the main problems with proof ofstake is these validators can and aresince during the blockchain bywithholdingumnon-compliant yeah right yeah and thisis wheremining the mining industry specificallymining is a mechanism beinga ruthlessly competitive business comesin because miners[Music]can onlycan only incan only enforce enforces in the rightword they can only try to subject thattype of controlOver The Ledger until it's economicallyunviable like the miners are slaves tothe full node consensus like they havethey are economically incentivized toplay Within the consensus rules setforth by the full nodes and then if youdo have one minor in one part of theworld who is withholding transactions ora number of miners working in a cabaltwithhold transactions the beauty of theeconomic system that Satoshi designedand launched is that users have theability to attach transaction fees andat some points the fee will be highenough where a minor who is running agood business and is profit driven willwill include that transaction or manysensor transactions in a blockso they'resort of beholden to the willof of the full node operators andindividual sending transactions they areslaves to these actors in the economicsystem with multi multiple stakeholdersso consider what would happen ifwell but before we go thereum I agree that there are there'sobviously that Dynamic that Dynamicsobviously true because we saw it with ablock size Forceum what we haven't seen likewhat we didn't see during that isI guess there's a lot of different waysthat could have gone down so let's sayyes totally the the the notes couldability blocks or refuse to payum their Defenders right refuse to paytheir their minersumlikewe haven't they weren't thattheoretically could have made them supervulnerable to a 51 attack as they weredoing that and it and it might have justbeen the case that that didn't happenif that makes senseyeah you can't prove it negative butyeahso yeah so like I guess there's I'msaying there's a whole lot of ways thatyou can compromise the security ofBitcoinand I'll give you another we've only wehaven't tested them all I mean we'vetalked about the four cores we have hadone other testum in 2015I believe 2014 or 2015 where I mean thisis a testament to the individual actorsparticularly in the mining industrybeingeconomically driven where you had onemining pool G hash dot IO accumulate 55of the network hash rate he had PeterTodd who's a Infamous uh was an Infamouscore developer I'm not sure he's workingon core anymore but he sold half a stashbecausejihash acquired 55 of the network hashand had the ability to uh 51 attack thenetwork uh what you saw there isuheconomically rational actors being theindividual miners who are pointing theirhash at jihash at the time immediatelyleaveG hash and flood to other pools becauseum they didn't want to be contributingto a potential 51 attackyeah sobut but the whole idea of a 51 attackproves thatminers do have some form of controlauthority over The Ledger like youwouldn't be afraidof a 51 attack if miners couldn'twithhold transactions or couldn't abusethat control authority over The Ledgerthe the fact that they can do that isthe reason why the the 51 attackvulnerability existsand and so that's just I guess just itjust kind of proves the point thatthere isum there is an attack Vector thereandthere is where there's good defenses tothat attack Vector as well economicallyyes driven individuals and then thenuclear option ofdoing something at the consensus layertostop the attackyeah so if you take my kind of radicalTheoryand you look at it as a soft War type ofdynamicpower is the ultimate free marketwhether it exists in kinetic form or orelectric form like your ability to findsources of power to wield sources ofpower to come up with increasinglyclever tactics techniques andTechnologies to project power moreefficientlythat's the in my opinion that the realfree marketandumand so in when you couple this abilityto add transactions to the blockto the projection of power what you dois you create all you recreate all thecomplex emergent benefits of powerprojection that we already see inkinetic Warfare but you effectivelyreplace itnow in in the cyber cyber domainum and so that's just a long way ofsaying likeyou know how the whole point of proof ofwork is to impose a physical cost to youknow to prohibit a denial service attackthat was like the original pointyou can't send an email unless you solveit but you go through the burden ofspending the electricity of solving thehash function has cost functionwhat Satoshi did wasum he coupled the ability to addtransactions to the blockhe basically used proof of work todefend thatcontrol action so you cannot addtransactions to the block unless yousolve the hash cost function so he'susing proof of work to secure The Ledgeragainst systemic exploitation in that inthat way does that make senseis he securing The Ledger or is he justcreate leveraging proof of workparticularly with a difficultyadjustmentto create a fair way to add transactionsaFair Way on a globally distributedNetworkI think it's both I think it'sdefinitely fair I think it's zero trustI think it's permissionless I think it'segalitarianbecause I think all power projection isthat wayand but you know you have to go back tothe whole point of proof of work in thebeginning which wasproof of work is a denial of servicecountermeasure and a 51 attack is a formof denial of service so it just makessense to use proof of work to prevent aa 51 attack by not allowing people toadd transactions to The Ledger unlessthey solve the hash calls functionso you effectively Park The Ledgerbehindthe proof of work protocol it'sconfusing because it's recursive Bitcoinis effectively proof ofthe Merit of proof of work or proof ofproof of work workingthe fact that it can't be that it hasn'tbeen 51 attack the fact thatall these dynamics that you're sayingwhich I also agree with are play out inthe and The Game Theory plays out isproof of this proof of work idea workingand and so so what that means is Bitcoinproves its own Merit that if you enablepeople the opportunityto use power itself Wattsto impose physical costs to make itimpossible to justify the physical costof Performing these types of systemicexploitsthen you can achieve a level of cybersecurity that no other type of softwarehas ever been able to achieve beforebecause predating this type of proof ofwork system the only way to attempt tosecure software is using logicalconstraints not physical constraints soreally what Bitcoin or I guess reallywhat proof of work represents is thefirst viable way to physically constrainsoftware to achieve software securityusing physical constraints and it's notthe only way and so there's definitelymore ways you can exploit Bitcoin andI'm not trying to argue against like thethe stuff that you saidbut it's just worth considering thepotential computer science precedentthat what what how well whatspecifically added back may haveunlocked here is a total transformationof the game of cyber security thatwe just weren't able to achieve yet andhe did it by tapping intothe power grid as the base layercomputerso so if you need to send a transactionlike if you send a transaction acrossthe Bitcoin Ledgernormally so like if you go to proof ofwork and you send a transact eachtransaction what's happening at the baselayer is transistors floating gatetransistors in my computerchange stateit's like essentially nothing happensit's like basically no power's nude inorder to send a Bitcoin Across TheLedger in order to send informationacross this thingvery large material sums of physicalpower has has changedso there is a very real and sharedobjective realityum very expensive quantity of physicalpower has changed its state and sothat's that gets pretty cool because nowyou can prevent unsafe control actionsor you can secure unsafe control actionslike the ability to add transactions toThe Ledgerby physically constraining it so it'snot that like people don't know what theexploitation to bitcoin is and it's notlike it's logically constrainedeverybody knows that if you can havemajority hash rate you can systemicallyexploit your Control Authority yourtacit control authority over thisover this Ledger it's not that theydon't know it and it's not that theycan't logically con um they can'texploit that logic it's that it's toophysically it's expensive it's an it'simpossible to justify the physical costof doing that in Watts not just and alsomoneybut really in Wattsum that's game changing I think in termsof cyber securityI agree I mean that the immense amountof energy needed toadd a block of transactions to thenetwork doesset Bitcoin aside as something that'sincredibly uniqueum and Innovative and revolutionary to adegree and then I guess this justdovetails intothe whole question why why do we have toequate it with war why why can't it justsimply be free market actionsby profit driven individuals and actorswho want the ability to profit fromaddingtransactions to The Ledger and thenthose individualswhose transactions these miners are areadding to The Ledger simply want to beable to cooperateum amongst each other outside of thestate's purviewum yeahso I I guess just from first like a justa very first principles approach if wesay okayfrom a cyber security perspective thisis revolutionary we have figured out away for people and programs to imposephysical costs on each other and fromthrough cyberspaceto empower literally Empower people todecrease the benefit to cost ratio ofattacking them or exploiting themthrough their softwareand there's definitely somethinghappening at the base layer that'sdifferent like there's a physicalmeaningful physical difference betweenthe way that the Bitcoin protocol Techstack works in the way that like someother poser uhcryptocurrency Tech stack works likethere's a whole lot of big ass machinesprojecting a lot of power so there is amaterially physically differentphenomenon happening that's happening atthe base layerwhat that means is what is really whatcould be really happening is that wherelike I said we're learning how to usethe globally decentralized electricpower grid as a base layer computerand then we're plugging that into theinternet and then why would you want todo that it's because the state space sowhat does the state space remember thisthing has a state space of two on andoffbut if you sum all the all the potentialState changes you create a state spacethe state space of This Global computeris physically constrained and physicallydecentralized in ways that no othercomputer that's plugged into theinternet has ever been and may ever willbethat means you've created a part ofcyberspace that is physicallyconstrainedand that allows you to impose physicalconstraints or secure your own softwarewith physical constraints in ways thatno other piece of cyberspace has everexistednot to mention the fact that it alsogives you other use cases like givingyou a way to settle disputes in a zerotrust egalitarian fashion or giving youa mechanism through which you canachieve consensus globally distributeddistributed consistent system alegitimate state of chain and legitimatestate of ownership and chain of custodyof underlying stuffthat is basically just a long way ofsaying this is so much bigger than justmoneymoney just happens to be the firstobvious use case of making a a the mostsecure place the most physicallyconstrainedplace and what could be the potentialfoundational base layer of the internetmoney is just an obvious first use casefor it because of course you want yourthing to beyou want your money to be secure like ifBitcoin is proof of proof of workworking then that means Bitcoin is proofof the the cyber security Merit of thistechnology which means if you useBitcoin as your money you have the mostsecure thing that's ever existed becausewe created it it's just been created andit's uh essentially impervious tonuclear scaleWarfarelike you would have to like the internetwill survivehumans if we get into a nuclear war likehumans would go extinct faster thanthe global uh you'd have to destroy theglobal internet and the global electricpower grid in order to stop Bitcoin ifif this theory is trueum and so you know it's back to yourquestion why frame it as War becauseI think that well that goes back tobut we were talking about earlier Teslapredicted that in order for agrariansociety to prosper long term they wouldhave to find some other means throughwhich theyengage in their power competitions andit pro it can't be kinetic powercompetitions because they'reuh they're too lethal we're getting toogood at killing each other they're toodestructivehe predicted that we would go towardsum some form of electric you knowmachines competing against othermachineshe did this before he knew aboutsoftware before he knew about computersgeneral purpose computers hadn't beeninvented yet at the same time you've gotthe people like Ford's and and standingnext to Ford you've got people likeEdison saying if you want to solve WarsturnPower electric power itself into moneywhat both of those Titans ofof American industry were missing wassoftwarethey didn't have a waylike if you create you know a globalscale physical power competitionindustry competitions with machinescompeting each other how do you manageit you need some form of softwareand if you created energy money howwould you manage it you need some formof softwareI think what Bitcoin might represent isthe marriage of both of those two ideasinto a single systemwhere J just as valid as it would be tosay that Bitcoin is a form of electronicmoneys was the Edison argument I think itwould be equally as technically valid todescribe Bitcoin as Tesla's vision ofthe end state of agrarian Warfare wherepeople are competing against each otherin a zero trust and egalitarian wayusing an electric form of global scalephysical power competition I thinkthey'reI think they both saw the same in-stateand I think Satoshicreated it yeah so it brings about peaceit's not war it's uh and so that's onething that anything just to becompletely up front like I've had I meanI've said publicly I've tweeted out thatthe hash Wars commence and I've thoughtof itthat way as well as like this global warfor hash rate but as I've gotten moreinto mining as an industry specificallyas somebody whoum runs my own personal miningoperations anduh connectedum uh professionally involved with acoupleum mining companies as well like it'sbecoming glaringly obvious to me it'snot reallya war at all it's it's ruthlesscapitalism drivenby profit motives that and so that againgoing back to the whole framing of yourthesis and trying to get Bitcoin to findas Munitions gradecryptography or crypt or cryptographygrade Munitions or whatever the word isyeah the phrase uh thatscares me personally I won't speak foranybody else because if it does getdefined as that and The Narrative of theworld is in a soft Warto control the Bitcoin Network or havetheir stake in the Bitcoin Network andnot the world but uh governments of theworld which areextremely corrupt arguably the mostdangerous entities that exist on thisplanetum and really have proven particularlyin the last three or four years thatthey don't really care about civilliberties or freedom in the digital ageuh pigeonholing Bitcoin as Munitions uhWarfare grade munitionsI'll creates a acrack in the door for the state to sayoh this isuh Warfare grade Munitions only uh wehave the right to declare war andcontrol those types of Munitions sowe're going to take overthe the hash rate industryso there's a couplecouple points to impact there soyou say Okay clearly Bitcoin is peacenot warum so this is the Bear in mind I'm themilitary dudeso I'll give you just a my perspectiveonthis idea of peace there has never beenum a meaningful duration of time in thelastlike 12 000 years wherelike humans haven't beenengaging in power projectioncompetitions against each other tocapture resources or to capture controlauthority over resourcesthis like idea of peace is not in myopinion a replacement to war like youcan't replace war with peace peace is areprieve from war it's that temporarystate of high trust between Wars whenpeople and governments can betrustworthy with alternatives tophysical power as the basis to settlingthere's disputes but to your pointit gets corrupted governments getcorrupted people get drunk off theirimaginary power and start abusing peoplethrough their belief systems andexploiting themor they just flat out get invaded theyjust they're just weak and they getcaptured so like this idea of peace tome is just a thing it's an imaginarything that has never existed it's just areprieve a temporary reprieve betweenphysical power competitions where ourdemonstrably dysfunctional abstractpower hierarchiesum are somewhat functional if that makessenseyeah I meanyeah that does make sense and againthat's the whole point of Bitcoin it'slike anti-state separate moneyfrom State because we don't want thesecorrupt hierarchies getting us into oresuh we don't want to fund them or allowthem to fund themselves via the Fiatmonetary system toperturb the ability of Peace time totake holdyeah I mean that's definitely oneso I when I look at when I try to lookat technology I try to be as likeum what's the wordlike it sounds bad but I try to be aslike sociopathic as possible I try tonot apply any type ofum ideology to the technology despitewhat its inventor might have called itthere's there's a lot of examples inhistory where likeyou know the person invented a thingintending it for to be for one reasonwhere it it ended up not being for thatreason so if you just look explicitly atthe technology here's the technologythat allows people to digitize convertpower into bitsand then pass it across the internet andby doing so you canessentially send packets of power youcan convert real world quantities ofpower into packets of information andpass it back to each other and by virtueof doing that in post physical costs oneach other but that again I won't getinto like semantics of how Bitcoin Worksgoing back to like full nodes like whenI send a transaction from my node tosomebody else's on the network in apeer-to-peer fashionit is getting confirmed in a blockin that process to get confirmed takes alot of energy but actually me sendingthat transaction is the same amount ofenergy as sending a tweetlike so actually extending thesemessages doesn't really like and this islike something that's gotten Bitcoin andtalk about like the ESG slant and thisis what that dude from dig Economist hasreally leaned in the energy pertransactionuh metric that he made a thin air thatis objectively just not how this worksat allwhen you send a transaction you'reessentially sending a tweet and takesthe same amount what takes a lot ofenergy is confirming that and confirmingthat transaction in a block is on thefront end of that is a lot of capitalrisk uh by an entrepreneurwho wants to make a profit for providingthe service to the Bitcoin network ofgetting these transactions confirmed sowhen we talk about Bitcoin securityI do think when you talk about we needto separate two things the securityof a transaction in a block so howconfident can you be that yourtransaction isn't going to beoverwritten by somebody who reworks thechain and then security of the consensusrules and what people are allowed to dowithin the Bitcoin Network which isdetermined by full nodesso maybe the more the better way ofsaying it isconfirmed information likeum once once some type once it has beenconfirmed enough to have successfullyachieved consensus across the nodes thatconfirmed state of informationrequired a substantial amount ofphysical power to toachieve that yes foryeah so for to pass confirmedinformation right to pass this bit ofthis packetfrom one node to another and to getthose in the alt nodes all agree andAchieve consensus on that passage ofinformation across cyberspacea non-trivial materially relevantrelevant amount of physical power had tobe expendedso if that's true then when you observea Bitcoin a Bitcoin passing acrossthis Ledgerthat technically represents symbolicmeaningthat you have applied to a materiallylarge quantity of physical power thathas changed its stateso you are so like if I'm like what I'mlooking at you like when I'm looking atyou right now or like anything on myscreens hereum that is symbolic meaning I haveapplied to transistor State changesbut if I were to see a Bitcointransactionand like be able to validate it througha node that is like a valid Bitcointransactionthat's completely different thananything else in cyberspace thatrepresents not a not just so to yourpoint yes it does still includetransistor State changes because that'swhat nodes do that's what they're madeout ofbut it also does include materiallylarge quantities of physical powerthat's changed state so it's not onlyjust transistor State changes it's largequantities of physical power Statechanges that means a Bitcoin transactionor any information that's passed throughthe Bitcoin Ledgeris fundamentally different in thecomputer science perspective at the baselayer at the state mechanism layer it isa totally it is a totally different typeof computer that's never existed beforethat's now plugged into the internetthat our peop people are using throughthe internetI think I don't know these are justtheories yeah just talk about theinternet too like that takes an insaneamount of energy I mean this is justhumans harnessing energy yeah indifferent ways well the I think one ofthe core problems is people for whateverreason they think thatum inefficient or power intensiveumyou know requiring a lot of power tosend information across cyberspace is isonly bad for whatever reason they thinkthat and for whatever reason people justtacitly assume that the cheapest way tosend information across the internet isgood but what Bitcoin proves is thatactually there are major important usecases for making it physically expensivein watts to send information acrosscyberspace and the obvious one issecurity because that is the mechanismthrough which the reusable proof of workLedger itself is secured againstsystemic exploitation at least in theform of 51 attacks so it gets back tothe same thing I keep harping on whereBitcoin is proof of proof of workworking it's proof that the ability toimpose physical costs it's it's proofthat a uh a a computer that isphysically hard to change States isactually useful as a security protocolbecauselook at it it'sbrilliantum so that was the first point there wasanother Point Uh crap I forgot where wewere likeum why Warokaypeace doesn't exist it's a reproduce ohyeah so yeah so pieces are we repeatfrom war it's the thing that happensthat consider this thought experiment ifWar didn't cause injury if there was away just hypothetically speaking that wecould fight Wars withoutwell physically causing people wouldpeople think it's fat would people evenwant abstract power hockeys I think weneed to take a step back first like whyare wars foughtumtalk today to focus on today's day andage check wire or wars fought a lot ofindividuals would argue U.Smilitary industrial complex exists toprotect the petrodollar systemat the end of the day so Bitcoinscreated this peaceful alternative whereyou don't need that kineticWarfare to go into far-off lands andoccupy them and use Force to intimidateother countries to convert their localcurrency to Dollars to buy oil on aglobal scale you can just Nix that andparticipate in this peacefulmonetary system that does not need thatthat level of force or the the cost ofthethe cost of attacking Bitcoin is so highthat's not even worthgoing through the kinetic process of ofattacking individual actors globallydistributedum like so that like why humans foughtWarshistorically most importantly todayumtofor the U.S perspective to protect thepetrodollar system and one could arguethat the U.Sis the biggest war Monger on the face ofthe Earth right nowumand then two if Bitcoin providesus the ability to peacefully protect amonetary Network without having to go togo flex around the world why why wouldit be crazy to think that that couldbring aboutan extended reprieve of peaceyeah no I I think that's a very logicalargument so when I think about what isuhwhat is war why is it causedI go first principles in everything I doso when I think about War I think aboutwhy do animalsprey on each otherjust generally speaking it's beginninglike beforebefore human beings existedum why do pack animalsconstantly fight with each other toestablish a pecking orderI think at the end of the day there'sjustum there's no replacement for physicalpower as the basis for settling disputesin a zero trusts and egalitarian way Ithink power projection is the only freemarket so I think war is the only freemarketum and I'm I'm not I'm not saying thatas like a like a for humans I'm sayingif you look at justyou go outside or if you you know take aspoonful of of sea water and look at itunder a microscopewhat you see is a whole bunch of animalskilling each other over resourcesand so I don't understand why why isthat because they weren't imbued withlogic to figure out a way to cooperatetooit yes yes so so yeah so that's whathumans did is humans were like okayyou know we we uh we got our uh firewe started cooking food we startedgrowing having a lot extra powerall that power went into thinking powerso we grew these prefrontal cortexes andthen we started thinking abstractly andwe started developing ideologies and westarted coming up with all sorts ofinteresting New Concepts like ethics andmorals and theologies and and all thisstuff especially once we got to agrarianmodern societyuh and behaviorally modern human beingsor sapiensand so I think you're right I think whatwhat makes sapiens completely differentfrom all these other wild animals isthatthey have the means to actually think ofalternatives to killing each other tosettle disputes anddetermine resource Control Authority anduhall this all the stuff I keep sayingachieve consensus on the quote unquotelegitimate state of ownership and chainof custody of property humans can thinkof alternativesto physical power as the basis for doingthat to killing each other as the basisfor doing thatthe problem is they're just they'redemonstrably dysfunctional they do notwork they keep on breaking down theylead uh it's obviously true that humansstill use physical power as the basis tosettle their disputes they still killeach other to settle their speeds andthey do it at a larger scale and use farmore energy and cause far more injurythan theybecause of their desperate attempts toto try to find a replacement it ends upbeing a battle over ideology yeah wellthen again we have to get back to theCoreof these disputes whichmany would argue myself included thatthe core of these disputes revolvesaround some perversion of the freemarket particularly the free market formonetary Goods where you have thesecorrupt governments gain control of themoney printer and that gives themcontrol over these other aspects of theeconomy of society which createsrestrictions for individuals to accessgoods or services or doand say what they want which leads tothe boiling point which creates the thewar the dispute the physicalconfrontation and going back Idefinitely agree yeah and soit hasn't been until and this is whyI think we need to be veryparticular veryum specific with howBitcoin is framed forsociety as we move forward it is thisrevolutionary technology that allows usto get away from that morass created bythe perversion of monetary systems bybloated governments that allow them tocontrol the purse and then controleverything else from there we finally Ithink it is we were born at this weirdinflection point in human history wherewe've been given this tool that allowsus to get away from that andmy perspectiveum probablysomeone considers himself ananarcho-capitalist would would say heywe should not betrying to convince the governments thatBitcoin is a weapon of War we shouldsimply say hey Bitcoin is text it'sspeech it's softwareif you do believe in free speech itshould be protectedthat way I should be able to send atransaction send a message to appears onthe network without fear of Retributionfor my governmentthank you for attempting to provide megoods and services but doing a terriblejob over the course of my life at leastI opt out and I'm deciding tooperate within the consensus rules thatset forth by the Bitcoin Networkum when it comes to interacting withothers throughout throughout the economywhen I exchange money for goods andservicesyeah soum before we go into the I know we'rethat's the meat of the convo is whycalled Bitcoin War but before we gothere since we since we can follow up atthat point it's like why Wars arestarted or why they happenum it's important to note that likeit's kind of unclear to where theboundary betweenhumans just fighting with each otherover stuff to like War like actual beingqualified as War large enough to bequalified as War startedbut what's what's very clear is thatlikePaleolithic sapiens startedum they stopped at early in the like youknow maybe 30 000 years ago they didn'treally have property they just carriedaround like what they could walk withand they were just constantly huntingand Gatheringand it wasn't until they figured outirrigation and and agriculture wherethey started parking themselves in thesame place so they started becomingum just like they just started notmovingand and then that's when like thatcorrelates to awareness thing that youcould call Warfare started when peoplestarted like actuallytaking over people's agriculture Agratheir land and and or trying to capturecontrol authority over that landso this phenomenon that we could callWar started after agrarian society wasinvented after people started usingAgriculture and started coming up withthese abstract ideas about quote-unquotelike governments or at least some formof what would resemble a government backin the dayand all that happened and all those warswere fought thousands of years beforewhat we now know as money or controlover money emerged before even gold wasused and adopted as as money so it can'tbe true that the onlydriver of warfare is is like a fightover money but I definitely would agreethat's one of the main ones nowand yeah but if I want to focus on warin today's day and age because obviouslythere's beena progression a evolution of societyso if you think about it uh money is abelief systemyou're applying symbolic meaning to uhsomething right you're saying this hasvalue is it not some it's a beliefsystemyou're choosing to say this piece ofwhatever shell or gold isof some certain valueuh this gets into like the wholeYuval nurari or Harare is a sharedillusion which I don't think it is moneyand the market has shown slowly butsurely over time and arguably willhappen more quickly as we move forwardinto the digital age thatyes at the end of the day you have toagree with somebody I believe that'smoney and you should give it to me butuh and I will give you these Goods butum money does have certain propertiesmonies do have certain properties thatmake some better than others portabilityso yeah for sure scarcity divisibilityverifiability all that stuffyeah interesting thought experiment it'sgoing back to the u-val thing isdoyou think that animals that aren'tcapable of abstract thinking that don'thave the prefrontal cortexes or whateveruh do you think that they can conceiveof moneyor is that a uniquely human thingbecause if it's a uniquely human thingand no one else can recognize it thenthat could be a leading indicator thatit is in fact ait is symbolic meeting applied tocertain things and and to your pointsome things are better to him to applysymbolic meaning to than others goldbeing an obvious one because if youimply the symbolic meaning of value togold and gold is physically constrainedor physically scarce then you actuallycreate a defensive mechanism where youphysically constrain people fromexploiting that belief system by tryingto increase the the supply of goldyeah yeah I mean there's plenty ofexamples out there of scarecrows andmonkeysum scarecrows putting Twigs into avending machineto get goods and monkeys exchangingsomething for grapes in return so thatthey I think they have the ability torecognize a value exchange at least sayI put the stick in this vending machineyeahbut okay let's let's fast forward a bit1971. Gold's no longer the basis of ofuh the monetary systemum it'sthat means there's no physicalbasis of the United States dollar rightwould you agree on that like it's justpurely an abstract idea it's backed bynothing at allrightthat'sI mean technically it's not backed bynothing it's backed bytreasuries with different durations thatessentially say hey we're going to giveyou these treasuries and we'll promiseto grow our economy at X percent in thefuture and that is going to be the valueof the future production of of our ourcountry's economyyeahand future anything is an abstract idealike the future me doesn't exist rightlikeI don't know for sure that I'm going toexist in the future so but yeah so likeFiat in general like I think one of theproblems with Fiat in general is it'stoo much of a belief system it doesn'thave enoughphysically backing it and I thinkanother argument that could be made isthat the United States dollar systemspecifically is essentially just a pieceof softwarethe the issue is somebody has controlover that ledger and with a keystrokecanchange itrightso if money is a if you can if you cansay well the modern state of the UnitedStates dollar or the Fiat system iseffectively just a globaluhsoftware piece of softwarepeople are just looking at their Ledgerand and that's controlled by someone whocan change that ledgerthen that would mean that what Bitcoinrepresents isis a way to physically constrain thatsystem like is a is a piece of softwarethat cannot becontrolled in that way it's a it's aphysically decentralized physicallyconstrained piece of software that noone person can achieve full-scaleControl Authority which is precisely theproblem of the USD Fiat systemis it does that make sense yep and sothat gets back to the war thing okay soWar thingumyou know why why it starts I think a lotof it has to do with belief systems Ithink peoplehave ideologies I think they want tobelieve inum some greater good or some right wayof settling disputesand some right way of managing resourcesand establishing a pecking orderintra-specially between sapiens I thinkwe all want that and we want a way to doit withouthaving to cause injury and but theproblem is when you use abstractionswhen you use abstract beliefs orideologies to do that you implicitlygive someone controlso like if you use a judge to adjudicatedisputes that judge has abstract powerthat judge has imaginary powerby virtue of our morals by virtue of ourethics and theologies and ideologieswe create belief systems which can beexploited we make ourselvessystemically vulnerable or we give anattack Vector to ourselves through ourbelief systems that we would not have ifwe continue to use physical power as thebasis to settle disputes and establishcontrol Authority because using physicalPowers the basis to do it is effectivelyjust going choosing the heuristic mightis right the most physically powerfuland most intelligent person capable ofprojecting power in the best way getsthe pecking order and yeah it's a bloodyfight but at least it can't besystemically exploited there's nochanging goal posts about like whatconstitutes right what you know there'sno body trying to fight orsay like what the correct ideology isand I think a lot ofwhat you see in agrarian Warfare ispeople competing they're essentiallyfighting for the right to Define rightthey're like fighting for the the rightto Define what the morally or ethicallyor theologically or ideologicallycorrect way of settling disputes withoutphysical power isand if that's true then the problem ofwar is just that it's kinetic that itcauses injury and that you can solve allthis by just converting it into anelectric form and then everyone justchoose they pick the might is Rightheuristic again and they just letyour belief system be founded onsomething that's zero trusts andegalitarian and permissionless and I Ithink these are all kind of theseDynamics are all happening in play rightnow I thinkI think that people can believe inBitcoin and use that as theirfoundational thing to believe in like wecan stop believing inUSDbecause we finally have an alternativethings to believe in and it's securedand it's it's uh it uses the exact sameglobal scale power dynamics as Warfarebut it just does it in a non-lethal wayand that's that's not just disruptive tomoney that's disruptive to all beliefsand to include government so it's likeif we can use a zero trust egalitarianpermissionless system to settle ourdisputes what is the point of governmentwhy do we haveumwhy do we need somebody with imaginarypower to determine what the thelegitimate state of ownership in chainof custody of property is when I can dothat in a zero trust egalitarian waythat can't be systemically exploited bymy government that doesn't have thatsecurity vulnerabilityand so again again it gets to this likething where it's like I think this ismore important than just money I thinkthis is I think this is such a big dealthat it is disruptive to the entireconcept of agrarian society in the firstplace it's not just disruptive to moneyit's disruptive to the idea ofgovernment itself and the idea that weeven need an alternative to physicalpower to settle our disputes anymorebecause if it's not causing or hurtinganyone then whywhy is it bad it can't be bad like howcan you morally justify that's badunless you try to use the attack Vectorof ESG and try to quantify its powerusage asquote unquote unethically badthat's why we have fixed the money fixthe world and neon lights right up overhere I do believe I meanI mean that's why it's fixed the moneyfix the world I think it's much biggerthan money yes because the sounddistributed peer-to-peer Cash System uhwill allow us to coordinatein a free market fashion to fix theworld that these governments have[ __ ] up pretty massively as it standsin 2022 and I guess I I think this getsback to the whole what I again I'll justtalk from my perspective is like whatI worry about by like lobbying thegovernment and trying to convince themthat this is a weapon of Warparticularly in the U.S again gives theman open door to say all right we need tocontrol this weapon of War which woulddefeatthe purpose of Bitcoin in the firstplaceand that's why I'm verysteadfast and Ardent about reallyleaning into Bitcoinas a First Amendment Free Speech rightum and I I think you could apply Bitcointo many amendments many of the first 10potentially allumThird Amendment prevents the IRS fromfrom uh courting your bank account orquartering in your bank account I thinkMichael Goldstein has said that beforeFourth Amendment unreasonable search andseizure they cannotumthey cannot seize your private Keys uhif you if you have them protected in theright wayum they would have to go prove that in acourt of law and have you hand them overum again yeah I think that'sthethe biguh issue I have with the framing ofBitcoin isfirst and foremost the Second Amendmentissue when I think it's a free speechissue and it could potentially I willconcede it could certainly apply to orfall under the Second Amendment in somecontext but I think the firstamendment's strongest and then at theend of the date is moneyum as wellum money is speechin a certain way you're basicallyarticulatingthat you're willing to exchange adefinedunit of value for a good in serviceum yeah not to sound too nerdy butspeech itself represents syntactic andsymbolic meaning that you apply to Statechanges inaudible wave patterns right like it is abelief system of speech itself thismanner through which we communicate witheach other issemantically and syntactically complexmeaning and that's precisely what we'realso doing while we establish symbolicmeaning to things that we choose to callus our like you know moneyso yeah I think they're literally thesame likeum from the foundational levelum okay real quickyou saidBitcoin is money or like that's what itspurpose isI want to make the point thatumwhenI don't remember how many years ago like900 years ago or somethingwhen the Chinese folks were when when abunch of doctors were trying to developnew concoctions for medicinal purposesthey came up with black powder and tothem black powder was a form of medicinebecause they were doctors and to need tobuild medicineand they thought it could have medicinalpurposes like cauterizing wounds orother stuff like that because they didnotice that it was quick to hold a flameand for hundreds of yearsthe doctors perceived black powder as amedicine it was to them the purpose ofthis thing was medicineand they even had monetary value theytraded this thing it wasn't used I don'tthink explicitly as money but it hadmonetary value but the point ispeople created a new type of powerprojection technology and they thoughtit wasmedicine and thenin the future it started ended up usingas something more than medicine itdidn'tit changed the perception of it changeto gunpowder once guns were invented oronce the mechanisms through which peoplecan project this power at each other toimpose physical costs at each otherchanged and so now we look at gunpowdertoday and we think do just take it forgranted like of course this is a weaponbut for hundreds of years people didn'tthink it was the point is physical powerprojectionthe mechanisms the Technologies tacticstechniques that we use to imposephysical costs as measured in watts oneach other changes over time and soone of the big assumptions that wecannot make is that the future ofwarfare will look the same as the pastwe can't expect the next War to looklike the last waranytime that's ever happened it'sit's not turned out well for examplewhen orb and the engineer showedConstantinople that you can usegunpowder to build a cannon andconstantinople's turned him down and ayear later the walls of Constantinopleare are being shot down like there'sthere's a lot of lessons and precedencein history where it's really importantto keep an eye out on the basics whichispeople are going to come up withdifferent Technologies to imposephysical costs on each other to lowerthe benefit to cost ratio of attackingand it's not necessarily kinetic andit's not smart to assume that the futureof warfare will look anything like thepast your job is to understand what thefuture of power projection will looklike and then to posture your whateveryou're trying to secure to win thatI say all this because one of the mainreasons why I keep like saying thatBitcoin could represent not just amonetary system but also could be usedas like some type of soft or non-kineticform of War fightingis is because I it could be accuratethat could very well like I know thatit's like it sucks to admit it and Iknow that could be an attack Vector butit also could be true like it just couldbe rightum we have to consider that possibilityat least my job is to at least considerthat possibility because I'm not here towin last Wars I'm when here to win thenext Forceyeah let's play it through though likeif that software scenario plays outnation statesget control of material amount of hashrate and then engage in hash Wars witheach other either physicallybombing mining centers or censoring eachother's transactions or one gets 51percent of cabal gets more than 51percent begin censoring transactionsjust completely defeats the wholepurpose of Bitcoinunreliable system of value transfersoyeah that's an interesting train ofthoughtum so here we can bring up the wholehash Force thingso I do not believe it is logical let'sassume it is software just forum this strictly for the sake ofargument and we'll address why thatsucks and why it could be an attackVector later but just for the sake ofargument now assume it could be asoftware protocolI don't think it would be smart for thegovernment to try to runthe hashingum I don't see like why do somethingthat you can get for free is effectivelylike my point of view on that it's likeif the commercial industry is willing toto run it just you know to have acommercially decentralized hash Forcewithout us having to pay for it then whythe hell would would the government wantto pay for that oror or try try toum ifyou know it's like it seems like betterto just buy Bitcoinum unless there was a threat of like anation-state level 51 attack so to yourpoint in these hash Wars like if Russiaand China had like these hash pools andthey started to attackthe United Statesmaybe it might be necessary for theUnited States to seedthe operation the Opex or the capex ofum a commercially decentralized hashForce but like it's already true todaywith the military industrial complexthat we don't like the space forcedoesn't build its own Rockets we letcommercial build the Rockets we don'tbuild our own satellites we letcommercial buildings the satellites wejust seed money to them to do that andyeah it's not a it's not a very goodfree market so it would it seems like itwould be better to just letthe free market do that because I thinkto your point it would be far moreeffective way to guarantee that we haveif this were the case that we have themost robust hashing infrastructureyeah but againI definitely think war will change andI'm notnaive to think that war won't exist inthe future but going back to the pointyou just made war in the future becomessignificantly more expensive becauselike you said the governmentdoesn't build its own Rockets doesn'tbuild its own weapons it prints moneyand pays Raytheon to do it or SpaceX andthis is inherent inthe problem that Bitcoin is trying tosolveum that that ability to print money exnihilo then allocate it towardsthese warmongering Endeavors number oneisn't fair number two isn't good forhuman progress or overall quality oflife on this planet and so yeah I Iagree that the printing of money to fundthe war machine as it had started100 years agouh seems to have backfired significantlyon the public because of that exactreason I think that a large part of whyworld the world wars were such a bigdeal is becausewe effectively set that precedent andumandand we we kind of but but the theproblem with that is it becomes theshelling point so like if it's anexistential imperative to win the war orelse you're going to get invaded andyour adversary is using a belief systema corrupted belief system where theycould print money add nihilo or ADDinfinitum and uhyou know like just basically to baseeveryone's savings to fight for the warcampaign that is a material advantage inwar fighting that thou becomes yetanother power projection tactictechnique orum or shelling point and so like youknow an interesting thought experimentis could the Allied Forces havewon the war if they weren't printing orcan a country that doesn't printcompete against the country that doesand and how would that change if thatmechanism uh is is changed I agree withyou I think that it would improvesubstantially people just adopted adifferent belief system a different typeof money I think that couldsubstantially improve and I think thatif Warfare is indeed a measure throughwhich weessentially compete over belief systemsto include like the United States dollarlike what value that isthen then yeah if you convert if yousimply just choose to assign value tosomething different then you couldtotally end the military industrialcomplex if you can get enough people tobelieve in it and that's something thatI do want toum encourage people to considerI think that if you simply like I havepersonally decided to no longer believein the value of the United States dollarand I only use it for just because otherpeople believe in it and I you know theyhave they you know when in those caseswhere they're not going to accept what Ibelieve has value I still need the useof the dollar and I obviously have tostill be paid in the dollar but I'dstill convert it I have simply chosennot to believe in thatand by virtue of doing that I haveeffectively completely undermined boththe physical power of government butalso the abstract power of governmenttheir ability to gain access toresources or secure access to resourcesorrandomly change theyou know press a keystroke and randomlychain that I'm no longer affected bythat by just simply changing my beliefsystem I think that we can get morepeople to do that they have to see whythat would be useful and I think a corereasonis because we have fundamentally changedthe mechanism through which weproject power through which we securethe stuff that we the the property thatwe value and the policy that we valueusinga physical power projection competitionlike we fundamentally change byfundamentally changing the mechanism ofWarthen you fundamentally changethe government the money the everythinglike you can create an entire new formof organization that has never been seenbefore that transcendseven this concept of a nation-statewhich is not even like a like the nationstates have only existed for like 200years the you know the scale of what weconsider Nation States todayI I agree to your point their failurethey're not working they're brokenpeople are getting exploited atextraordinary scaleI think what we've been missing is justan alternative and I think that Bitcoingives us the alternative because itprovides all the Alternatives it's notjust the money but it's also themechanism through which we secure zerotrusts in egalitarian access and anddecentralized control so it's it's notjust the new form of money it's the newform of governance it's the new form ofwarfare and all people have to do isjust believe in it and start to kind ofalign to thatokay so moving forward let's get to thereal convoI I think thatthe message that agrarian society hasinventeda soft form of warfare is fundamentallya positive message so long as peopletake the time toto understand really what it means if ifit's true that we've created a digitaldigital electric or Electro digital formof global scale physical powercompetition then we've all we'veobviously created a non-lethal form ofwarfare and so the the thought processeswell holy crap if we created anon-lethal form of warfare that'sremarkable that could dramaticallyimprove theour ability to secure ourselves andum and prevent destruction and all thehorrors that we've seen throughout thelast 100 yearsand so I think that's fundamentally likea a goodum a good thing but alsoit just make it another reason why it'skind of a cool idea to think about is ifyou think aboutum what we talked about earlier withTesla and the problem with KineticWarfare is it becomes too efficient likethe more efficient you come atprojecting kinetic power you get thenukes and then you strategicallystalemate yourself and then you get intoa systemically exploitable hazard wherepeople are like basically reallyvulnerable to being oppressed by theirruling classbecause the the asymmetryan electric form of warfare would wouldcould get increasingly efficient adinfinitum they're likethere's no limit to how theoretically nolimit to how much power that honestpeople can project to defend theiraccess to the stuff they value not justagainst their own governments butagainst there's other thingswhen it comes to hashingso so in terms of power like how muchwatts that people can sum together inorder to impose a physical cost in wattsof in this case 51 percent in attackingthemtheoretically it's hard to think of likelike a limit to there might be somepractical ones obviously right nowthere's practical ones but like aprofitability limit once it'snon-profitable like why would yourun it at a losssopeople routinely go into non-profitumso likewell I guess you could argue it's stillprofitable so like for example you knowone of the arguments for why people gettaxed is becauseit's not exactly a profitable Endeavoralwaysuh not strictly speaking about theUnited States military but othermilitariesstanding militaries are just bythemselves super inefficient like youhave to feed all these armies let's justgo back not nation states but let's goback 500 yearslike if they're not going aroundcapturing anything they're notprofitableright it's like a a standing armysitting around doing anything is justOpexum and sothere I guess there might betimes wheremaybe probably only temporarily therewould be a motive if especially if thereare nation-states and especially if itwas like a national scale hash War wherenation states would be willing to dipinto the red in order todo their attack but I think to yourpoint long term that's not really viableyeah because I can't print money to doit because it'll be on a Bitcoinstandard and is that the way they areyeah but they can get more efficientthoughthey can get more efficient so like theycan make the watts per dollar watts perBitcoin basis more and more efficientand I I guess just that's just somethingto think aboutum that's an interesting kind of thoughtexperiment whereas whereas there arehard limits to how efficient you canmake kinetic power projectionthere might not be a strict of a limitto how far you can make electric powerprojection efficient okayso putting that aside orum would it be badif we frameslet's just assume that maybe even if itis accurate to call it a potentialwarfighting technologyshould we because with that andintroduce a an attack vector or thegovernment could try to use it againstusum I thought about that a lot andand this is kind of the way I thinkabout it soI can demonstrate it let's do a thoughtexerciselet's say they're um you're like a likea flight squadron commander you're incommand of a squadron ofumlike uh A10 fighter jets or somethingthe A-10 fighter jets take off they'regonna do some campaign some powerprojection campaignand they get pretty wrecked like five ofthem get shot down only five make itbackout of the tin and you notice a patternfor every single one of these a10s thatare landing they barely make it homebecause their wing tips have beenshredded offand like their tail fins have beenshredded off and they just like finallymake it home and landso you're a squadron commander you'vegot some Engineers it's like okay wellyou need to do a new sortieand you need these like fighter jets toyou know like be a little bit moreresilient like they need to be able tosurvive the fights that they're they'retakingand you have the opportunity to like addsome reinforcements to these Jetswhere would you choose to place thereinforcements on these jets that arecoming back crippled with their wingtips blown off and theirand they're like Tail Fins blown offhave you had to make that callif you had to replace parts of the planeorlike if let's say you fix the plane upbut you you keep on you notice thispattern where their wingtips are beingblown off and their tail fins are blownoff and it's like barely giving them theopportunity to like land and half of theother ones are are never making it homeif you have the opportunity to like addreinforcements or like add likelightweight armor to make them like moreable to like withstand blowswhere would you put itif they're wingtips and their tails arebeing blown offI'm not I'm not uhwell versed on the physics of airplanesso I'm trying to decide what's uh moreimportant foryeah the functioning of an airplane thetail or the wings I would assume the uhthe wings butthis was actually a problem I worked onas a blast and ballistics engineer itwasn't specifically this we hadlightweight armorand we had to figure out where to put itokay soum yeah it's totally rational to thinkall rightyou should reinforce the wingtips or thetail whatever one's more important toflight and light controls right it makessense that's what your gut tells youthe the problem with that is it'stechnically totally irrationaland there's a logical flaw that'shappening it's called the survivorshipbias this is a problem anytime anythinghas to survive some type of like uhnatural selection process maybe notnatural selection but like a rigorousselection processit's called survivorship bias and thebias that happened isyou're only paying attention to theplanes that made it backso you're ignoring the planes that nevermade it home and you're only payingattention to the planes that made ithome and you're noticing the pattern inthe planes that made it home is thattheir wing tips were blown off and thattheir tail fins are blown offbut you're ignoring the fact that whatmade it home went through a rigorousselection process in other words whatyou see is what survivesyou are looking at where the plane canactually handle the hits where it canactually take the hitsand if you need in in all the placesthat isn't being shotthat's where actually you should bestarting to consider reinforcing orplacing armor because that's the placesof the planes that didn't make it homelike you're only the thing that survivedthe natural selection okay so that's ademonstration an easy demonstration ofsurvivorship bias you can Wikipedia andthey use pretty much the same exampleby the way the way we would do it is wewould giveum The PJs uh these armor plates asseats and so they would sit on the seatso they could take shots and it wouldn'tlike shoot them uh the rest of theairplane could get shot but the peopleinside the planes would wear the armorokayI say all that because let's get back tothe whole big shebang and this whole bigargument about like we don't want togive thethe government ammunition against usbecause they might try to repeat whatthey did where they call it a munitionand then try to prohibit the public fromhaving access to it in my opinion theThe Logical flaw there is thesurvivorship bias flawyou are looking at the thing thatactually survived like the last time thegovernment actually triedthat form of attack was a demonstrablefailure so you you know based off of thefact that it's already happened that ifthe government tried towithhold Munitions grade ormilitary-grade security technology fromthe publicthat it wouldit would have a difficult time doingthat because that's what alreadyhappened you know exactly that's likeyou know we like we there's thistendency for people on Twitter to belike this is what the Government triedto do and I look at that and I'm likeyeah that's what the government failedto do so you're that's the demonstrablyfailing strategy of the governmentthat's why they pulled their punchyou're seeing where you can take the hityou clearly can take that hit becauseyou've taken that hit before and wesurvived itit and so and then also to go back tothe point that we made earlierIt's like because of surviving that hitand because of getting to the pointwhere likewe're finally able to get some of thisencryption technology this what thismilitary grade Munitions technologytaken off of the Munitions list or atleastgiving to the public like in a thegovernment already decided to do thatthey already made the conscious choiceto export this let's call it a Munitionsor an arms worldwideso if a government wanted to try toattack this narrative thatBitcoin is a Munitions or try to takeadvantage of that narrativethey would have to do two things firstof all they would have to uh try toexplain how it's logical that somethingthat they've already chosen to exportpublicly globallyshould suddenly be restrained but notfor everyone only for the United Statesso like we've already decided to givethis technology out to you to everyonebut for at this point likeonly like Americans only Americans can'thave it everyone else can have it butonly Americans can'tand then because that doesn't actuallyprotect them from the threat of like itbeing used against them that just onlyprotects them the threat of it beingused against them by their own peoplelike other countries could still do itso it's just kind of like a rationallike hard to justify argument but thenit's also The Proven failure strategylike they already tried to do this andit already failed you already know thatyou can take those hitsand so in my opinionit's like you can gain the benefit ofthe First Amendment and the SecondAmendment and maybe like maybe the firstamendment is stronger than the secondbut like the first amendment and theSecond Amendment could be stronger thanjust the First Amendmentargumentbutbut also likeyou want to take the fights you can youknow you can win and II think this is a fight that we know wecan win because we already won it itwould just be round two and then I thinkit would be highly politicallyunfeasible or at leastat leastumless feasible than strictly onlyattacking the First Amendment wayI don't know about that though becauselike especially when you'reposturing this argument in the eyes ofthe public thatstill is a bit ignorant to bitcoin whatit is and is a bit fearful and seeswhat's going on in FTX and mount Cox andall this stuff and has a naturalaversion reaction to bitcoin that for Ithink we could probably see most peopleis somewhat negative again thrusting weneed to predict this as as a weaponnarrative could have them double down onon that negative connotation like wait asecond the bitcoiners are or holdingweapons with their private keysthat's one yeah it's onerobot I would have to that line ofthinking then too Survivor [ __ ] biasyeah I meanum I think bitcoiners specifically haveproven to have extremely adversarialmindsets whereagain like that I think that's where Icome from it's like why evengive this narrative legs to run onum when we have bigger things to worryabout like social attacks FTX potentialsocial attack we don't know what's goingon there like dude because that could bethe attack Vector the attack Vectorcould be to not let the public toessentially take advantage takeadvantage of the Public's misperceptionas Bitcoin being strictly money and nota military-grade security system forthemselves that they could use to defendthemselves against their own governmentlike it could be the case that thegovernment is deliberately trying to notbring that up because they don't want totake that fight because they know theycouldn't win it last time yeah but thenyou have to get back to why Bitcoin is agood money in the first place and whypeople can have confidence that it's agood money becauseit is distributedit is verifiable it is scarce like ithas it is a good money because it hasvalue because it has value because itprovides fundamental utility that doesnot existelsewhere yeah but one of those majorutilities of Bitcoin isweapons create security ormilitary-grade security like the TheNarrative that Bitcoin is money but alsothe most secure money so secure that noteven the United States can exploit it inmy experience explaining this to peoplethat that resonates with people it theylike they people just understand thevalue of security and more so than likemoney it's like harder to explain moneyI found but that's might just be becauseI hang out with military dudesbut like for whatever reason the idea inmy experience and I've just been testingthis publicly is that for whateverreason it's resonating like I can cutthrough so much BS by just cuttingstraight to we've created a new form forpeople to secure themselves byprojecting power and from throughcyberspace this is a revolution not justand money but in computer science andand cyber security and that's just likefor whatever reason that connects I'veseen and I think that there is somethingto gain by combining all thesenarratives together and I think thatthis the fear that the government woulduse it against youum is ignoring that the government couldjust as equallyuse the fact that you're not thinkingthis way against you like they could bebenefiting from the fact that you arenot considering it from a Securitiesperspective that you're only consideringit from a monetary perspective and thefact that people justdon't understand money theyand I think that's why you see like thegovernment arbitrarily deciding to binand categorize Bitcoin as just a cryptoI think they're deliberately trying toconfuse people and then steer them offthe path right there and I think thislike last cycle has just been is provenhow effective that strategy is is to getpeople into the [ __ ] coin path insteadof thethe path that they ought to be onyeah I know it'sincredible attack vectorI just like for the sake of adversarialthinking we just can't rule out the factthat like for me when I'm talking topeople especially at the oppodis or osecdeaf level it is I feel like I'm takingcrazy pills that no one is recognizingthe elephant in the room that this isNSA technology that they made publiclyavailable to the to to everyone they'reno one's recognizing the use cases ofthis as anything but a monetary systemand so in my military trained brain I'vebeen trained to believe to to know orrecognize that if you want to understandthe strategy of your adversary look atthe thing they're not doing and to meit's a red flag that no one is willingto acknowledge Bitcoin as anythingexcept a monetary system or that they'reonly acknowledging that as its only usecase it's like why aren't they what aretheylike that that to me is an attack vectorand we could be complicit into that formof attack by refusing to acknowledge itas anythingbut just the monetary system that's justsomething we had to considerand I don't think theseI think these two ideas are like Bitcoinit's first and foremost money right likeand it just so happens to Leverageshot 256.distributed proof of work with thedifficulty adjustment like that is howyou get the money that is what providesa value likeyes it uses cryptography that wascreatedby the NSA but and that that is a pieceof the puzzle that makes Bitcoin workand gives the the monetary asset valueat the end of the day like thethe use case is Muddy like peer-to-peervalue transferso this gets back to a more annoying uhcomputer science like technobabble butanytime any computer programmer decidesto use whatever abstract or semantic orsyntactic language to describethe intended behavior of anything theywrite any form of computer programthat software engineer is making anarbitrary decision based off of what hethinks what information he thinks isimportant so if like I'm a if I'm acoder and I write a computer program andI want to explain to someone how thiscomputer program works I choosearbitrarily based off what I think isthe most effective way to explain thisI choose what to call it so I can callit a cloud or a thumbnail or a string ora cointhat that is technically an arbitrarydecision and it's guided of course bythe intent of the program but justbecause I intend for this program towork this way it doesn't mean that's theonly way that program or that's the onlyuse case that program could be used forand I I demonstrated this in in thespace force because when I was adirector of operations for uhfor for the second space launch Squadronwe would use a special piece of softwareto monitor all the alarms that are goingoff on the Rockets before they launchand so we would just keep track of thealarms and it just made it easier tolike bin them and close them outwe took when covid hit we took that atliterally the exact same Pro programthat's exact same software no changesand it's source code at alland instead of using it to monitoralarms in a rocket we just changed thename and we just changed some of thewords in itand we used it to do contact tracing forclosely tight-knit uh combat Crews thatwe needed for like our satelliteoperation so just to make sure thatwe're keeping track ofum it's just an easier way to make sureof keeping track of who's got covid andhow to structure our our staffingbecause we have like really tight-knitoperation screws the point is I took thesame software with the exact same sourcecode that was on in one room a launchmonitoring software and I used it as acontact tracing software and that becamelike it became more of a big deal as theas the contact yeah facing software thanit did as last year so like the samesource code can be used for multipledifferent use cases it doesn't matterwhat the who wrote it and what theythink but the plugin doesn't changeapplied to bitcoin you just Fork thecode and created a whole newconsensus Network that would not havethe net in the distributed systemexample will not have the network effectand valueof Bitcoin yes I mean many people haveforked Bitcoinand created othercryptocurrency systems that do differentthings like coin forexes Supply aquarter of the block speed differenthashing algorithm yes you can do thatand that's the beauty of Bitcoin andWyatt is purpose fit for money isbecause even if you do Fork off and dothat stuff it is has the best networkeffect has the best properties has thebest distributionand therefore is the best money andthat's why let's consider thislet's consider this when proof of workwas first created by let's sayum Adam's Adam back's version of itthat proof of work token which he calledthe stamp but later cashthat was not intended to be used as amoney that was intended to be used as adenial service countermeasure in hisspecific case as you mentioned earliertoimprove email spam yeah I get whatyou're saying the proof of work beginsas not a moneyand then it's use case and Satoshi tookthat so it like the precedent was thisis not moneyand then Satoshi was like oh this couldalso be used as money in a specificapplication known as Bitcoin so likethat specific application the Bitcoinnetwork has side load value purposeutilityand network effectslike you can somebody will use somebodyother people have is proof of work withthe difficulty adjustment which wassatoshi's innovation in othercryptocurrencies but not to haveattained the valueof Bitcoinum and so like thinking it like likethinking like Bitcoin will be somethingdifferent in the future yes maybe thesource code will be fork and somebodywill create something else but thatwon't like give actual Bitcoin utx'sdifferentuse cases that will exist on that otherchain that other code baseso I tried to demonstrate with my massblocking campaign a potential use caseof Bitcoin as something else Beyondmoneyand so I know like we've had you knowyou've got the uh Michael saylors outthere that that implies stuff like uhthat have like bounced around ideas likeumorange check right isn't that what hecalled it the orange check ideaokay so if we just consider that for asecond if it requires if you have tolikepost Bitcoin as collateralor something in order to have theability to tweet or something I thinkthat was kind of like the idea behindthe orange check yeah it's a sphinx chathas done this there's some lightningNetwork enabled apps yep yeah so you'veseen a couple like that yeah you can'tsend me an email you can't send me amessage unless you collateralize it withBitcoinso you're choosing to see that as apaywall or you're choosing to see thatprotocol as a payment system becauseSatoshi Nakamoto described this protocolas a coin or a peer-to-peer paymentsystembut if it's also true that from afundamental computer science perspectivethat Bitcoin represents bit power ordigitized power symbolic meaning Booleanlogic applied to quantities of physicalpower from the globally decentralizedelectric power gridthen what you're doing when you say youcan't send me a message unless youcollateralize it with Bitcoinwhat you perceive as a paywallcould equally as could equally beperceived as an energy wallI am creating a power wall like youcan't send me a message unless you havethe power to execute that transaction orat least hold thatbit quote unquote coinsoyeah you can so you can you can't accessthis unless you send me value asdenominated in satoshi'syeah okay so that is a security protocollike I'm I'm degrading that is a denialof service countermeasure like you can'tsend me and spam me with a bunch ofemails unless you you collateralize ityou're choosing to call that a paywallor or a payment transaction based off ofnothing other than the fact that someAnonymous guy arbitrarily decided tocall this thing a coinif that makes sense it's it's like it'sa value transfer though like if theyview the content or the message behindthe paywall or the energy wall whateveryou want to call it like you give upsome satoshi's for what you perceive tobe valuable on the other side yeah soyou can use semantic cases like energywell whatever but at the end of the dayit is a transfer of money for a goodthe content soyou're applying value to power so you'reeffectively choosing to monetize poweroh this well no this goes backespecially if it's over the lightningNetwork this goes back to what I saidearlier like me sending a lightningtransaction over my phone to unlock oneof the newslettersI've yeah it doesn't take a lot ofenergy um I try to think only on baselayer so yeah I totally agree onLightning net on Lightning layer that'strue just thinking even on the baselayer like I'm not expending energy I'mjust sending Bitcoin the miners areexpending the energyyeah you've deferred that energyexpenditure to okay so I think anotherway to think about it is thisI think this is where we're gettingconfused because I think this is a thisis another computer science thing andlike peoplethis might be explainable by virtue oflike understanding how literally uh likethe base layer State mechanism layerlike level at the bottom of the techstack it's a physically differentphenomenon that's happeningwhen i s when I choose to call call apiece of software like a normal piece ofsoftware operating on a normal computera cointhat is semantic that is semantically asa semantic thing rightI am abstracting the complex emergentbehavior of this computer as a what Iwill arbitrarily choose to call coin ora cloud or a thumbnail or whatever okaywhen you choose to call Bitcoinbit poweryou are nottechnically only abstracting becauseactual power is the state changingmechanismin other words in computer sciencepeople hypothesize they they treatabstract things as real things that'show object oriented design works andthat's how we talk about software asobjectsbut ifif the state changing mechanism itselfis power and you're assigning Booleanlogic or machine code to quantities ofphysical power and then you choose todescribe that as bit powerthat is not hypothesizationhypothetization that is not abstractthinking it is literally power like youare literally like literally quantitiesof physical power are transferring whenyou call it I'm transferring bit powerto you or I have a bit power walllike there's actual literal power thatis preventing that transaction or orapplying that physical constraint that'swhy it's like that's the whole reasonwhy Bitcoin is just like mind-blowing isbecause it's the only thing that is likethat in the wholewhole interneteverything else is an abstractionand so so you can choose to call bitpower a coin but once you've called bitpower a coin then you've abstracted onsomething that is otherwise actuallypower like actually bits of power likeactual digitized power actual power thathas been converted into ones and zerosjust like any any state changingmechanism can be converted to ones andzerosand so they like in my opinion the moretechnically accurate way to describe aBitcoin transaction is actually a bitpower transactionyou are collateralizing you can't sendme a message unless you send some somebit power with it and by virtue of doingthat I have technically imposed aphysical cost and Power on youso I'm like making it harder to justifythe physical cost of sending me messageswhich is deterring you it's a it's aclassicturret strategyand that has a lot of applicationsit's still money you're just changingthe name to bitpower instead of Bitcoinit's yeah butbut you could also equally argue thatit's bit power that you're choosing tocall Bitcoin because you're choosingthat this stuff has monetary valueI mean by itself it was launchedregardless intent of having monetaryvalueas a peer-to-peer digital cache systemI mean if you want to get reallytechnical you're actually transferringit's not Bitcoin you're transferringunspent transaction outputs andas denominated in satoshi'sumyeah so like let's consider this is goldmoney or is gold gold that we choose toassign value to as moneyis a shell gut money or is a shell ashell and we decide touse our abstract thoughts and beliefsystems to call that valuablelike physical quantities of thingsphysical objective realityis ontologically like different thanthese abstract things or this abstractmeaning that we assigned to it a shellis a shell regardless of whether we callit a money gold is a gold regardless ofwhether or not we call it money bitpower is bit power regardless of whetheror not we choose to call it money andwhether or not even the inventor whatthe intent of the inventor wasyeah but again they're stillthere's no money you're just calling itsomething that really your value isbeing Trans Energy is beingexpended right yeah it's being convertedbut to electricity hashes are beingproduced blocks are being added andwtxos are being spentas inputs and new utxas are beingcreated on the back end valueis being transferred like now we're justgetting to likea very deep semantics argument which Imean I love it because I love gettingmetaphysical but like it is howproductive is it at the end of the daywell it's important becauseif you're trying to pigeonhole thisthing into money then we could bemissingvery different use cases for itandyou're just you just have this hugeblind spotbecauseI'm trying to think of like differentlike you can'tyou can send messages Bitcoin is amessage you can send an OP return with amessage attract attached to yourtransactionum maybe that's another use case of likean actuala graffiti wall where you can put yourmessagesumyou can do things with utxos lock themup in multi-cigs that have conditionalspends but again at the end of the dayit's all value transfer as denominatedin satoshi's which is a form of moneyso thinking about how software Works howsoftware gets hackedanytime software gets hacked it's notbreaking it's just a systemicexploitation somebody figured out how toexploit the logic of that softwareso the way that you can secure softwarepre-bitcoin is you can only try to finda way to make enough complicated logicso that people can't figure out how toexploit that logic but the problem is nomatter what type of logic you use youcan't actually stop someone fromexploiting that logic like logic doesn'tstop the exploitation of logic andthat's why they're that's why cybersecurity is so difficult is is becausethere isn't a way touhto physically constrain the execution ofcertain control actions or controlsignals except there is nowand so in terms of like well what otherpurpose could this have besides justmoney the purpose is we've created a wayto impose physical costs on each otherand from through cyberspace people canimpose real costsand physical objective reality asmeasured in watts on other people andfrom Foods cyberspace and so canprograms too why why do they do itbecause doing sofacilitates the movement of this moneythis money has value all this cost thatis being expended at the end of the dayis because the utxos the tokens havevalue as monetary Goodsit doesn't make sense if it's not moneybecause there's no reason to buy the A6to line up the energy contracts to buythe Transformers plug that in and it'sdone because people want toproduce a profit for facilitating thetransfer of this monetary goodyeah I do agree that this systemwouldn't work if people didn't monetizeitif if that's what you're saying likelikeit needs people to Value bit power asmoney in order toto function and to have as much of arobust ecosystem as it has now like thisthis whole globally decentralizedhashing industry wouldn't exist ifpeople weren't monetizing yeah as moneyand this is where like Austrian Theorycomes into play again with monetaryGoods like the opportunity cost of usingBitcoin is something that is not moneyis too high like that is extremelyvaluable as money so once you begin towaste it onother use cases againso other than like some messages likeI'm finding hard to like think of otheruse casesumlike just at the end of the dayevery software problem like almost everysoftware problem hack or systemicexploitation is because some controlsignal was sent that shouldn't have beensent like somebody sent a control signalthat placed this system into a hazardousstateand there weren't enough logicalconstraints to prevent that fromhappening yeah it's happeningbut if you happen to use instead oflogical constraints you just saywell okay if if we know this is anunsafe control action that could sendthe software into a hazardous stateand we don't want to try to logicallyconstrain someone from sending thatsignallet's justnot real allow that signal to be sentunless it's collateralized by 10 Bitcointhen you have create you have securedthe system the same way physical systemsare secured like I secure my systembecause my my money's safe and my safebecause it costs too many watts to getthrough ityeah but the systems thatyou're using the bit power wall thepaywall whatever you want to call it orexternal to bitcoin like it's beinglike it's securebecause people don't want to lose theirBitcoin because it's valuable moneyand their stake they're if they'restaking it they're saying all right I'mtrusting that'll get good value back andwe'll get taken from meumlike again those things are external tobitcoinBitcoin can be used I mean I use it onmy website as a paywallum hey if you want this content yougotta pay me 25 cents worth of setsum but yeah everything everythingis completely external to bitcoinbut imagine if you had apis that saysyou can't access or you can't sendcertain control signals across theseapis unless you collateralize them withBitcoin so let's just go ahead and sayit's still only a monetary system nowyou've created a way for people tosecure themselves with what we'll callpaywalls but are actually physicalconstraints because there is a materialreal physical presence required to sendthese things hey I need to put up valueto get value you need to pay money andthen yeah yeah and then you do it in azero trust and egalitarian way that nocountry or any group of people has everbeen able can have control authorityover so you have a zero trust andegalitarian system through which now youcan secure software not to accesscontent but to prevent unsafe controlactions to physically to to constrainum to basically make your software moresecure we know this works because like Ikeep saying proof of Bitcoin is proof ofproof of work working so you can usethis exact same protocoland you can nowuse it to secure all kinds of thingsthrough all kinds of apis that useBitcoin just collateralize controlactions just like a firewall but withBitcoin I don't know that doesn't reallysecure the software at the end becauseat the end of the day somebody couldhave somebodyhey means that's the paywall my websitethen my back end front-end developmentteam could be [ __ ] coders and still haveit insecure system on the back of thatyeah I mean it still requires gooddesign but it's impossible to say thatit wouldn't work as a security protocolbecause it's working as a securityprotocol like the fact that proof thatBitcoin hasn't been hacked is proof ofits Merit as a security protocol becauseit uses proof of work to secure its ownLedger at Bitcoin has an isolated systemyes when you yeah I agree I think Ithink API calls are going to be here Igive you packet of data you give methree sets like I think that'sthe future of data transfer or valuetransfer via data and API calls in thefuture I think that's it but again Ithinkthe security of software that you'regetting a return is external to theBitcoin Networkuh yeah I I guess soum one way to think about it is if youhave a global computer like let's justassume that's rightwe've created a globally decentralizedcomputer with a globally decentralizedState space made out of all thethe power gridsum if you are not allowing software orinformation and software or statechanges in your software to changeunless it's collateralized by Bitcointhen what you're doing is you'reconstraining the execution of yoursoftware tothe base layer State mechanism that isthe global computerso like your software cannot move orstay to State change States or send newcontrol signals unless it'scollateralized by Bitcoin and so whatyou've done is you've made your softwareslave to theto bitcoin to the transfer ofinformation off the off the Ledgerand so you can actually use like singleSATs as not just money but asas physically constrained pieces of ofbits of dataand I I think it's a probably a morecomplicated way of what you justdescribed but the point is that's hugethat's actuallythat is totally game changing in theentire like 80 years of computer scienceand because we are already in asituation where the where whereumyou know we're already fighting there'slike already cybercom there's already aU.S cyber command there's already cyberwarfare's already thingumelectronic warfare is already thing andnow if you've created this new way tophysically constrain or secure thingsthrough Bitcoin then it's not a big leapto think okay wellcrap we this could become game changingforthe entire industrialized mechanism ofcyber War fighting that we've alreadycreated yeahI mean it's happening people are goingto listen to this podcast they're gonnabe streaming SATs to my lightning nodethat's not on chain butyeah I gotta do want to take the againand then I think I agree I do think itwill increase the security of softwareand the Integrity of services and thequality of services but it's notit is because if people are going togive up their sets they want somethingof extreme valuein return so that will just make it sothe people developing these softwareprojects and these services will ensurethat they are providing the best codethat the market has to offer and butagain like the paywall it's likebitcoin's not inherently securing thatsoftware it is creating the incentive toprovide extremely secure softwarebecause people are really going to partwith their sets if they're receivingwhat they believe to be a commensurateamount of value in returnyeah I mean it's kind of like the socialincentive of it the pure free marketeconomic incentive like hey if I'mgiving you Bitcoin I get back to likeHuman Action Austrian Theory like fixthe money fix the world the world getsfixed because we fix the money and themoney because it's such a good money uhincreases the opportunity cost of ofproviding a shitty service becauseyou're recurring Revenue will dwindlepretty quickly once you Swindle somebodyout of their sets and provide them [ __ ]service we're goodyeah I mean it I I guess it's just twoways of looking at the same thing and ifif you want to choose to look at itstrictly as a monetary thing and it onlyis working because of its value as a asaum as a monetary system that's that'sfair but I think it's underselling it Ithink if you look at what's physicallyhappening in shared objective realitywhere bits aren't moving or at least nothaving consensus of having moved untillarge quantities of physical power havetransferred then what you are doing byrestricting a piece of software fromsending a control across an API orchanging its state is actually applyinga physical cost in watts to doing thatand so in that sense you are physicallyconstraining the execution of an unsafecontrol action just like a safety switchphysically constrains the pulling of atriggeryeahsee again yeah I think I think wedisagree here whereall that is external to the BitcoinNetwork yes a lot of energyis expendedum but again it's internal to the biggerlink utexes or produced coin basedtransactions are released to minersall external to the system and thenthatclosed loop network of Bitcoin allowsyou to go create these efficiencies andquality improvements and everythingBitcoin touches I do I think Bitcoinwill touch everything I mean we have acompany in Ohio sonodoI believe that's how you pronounce itbut they're doing immediate valuetransfer uh you sent me a lot of energyI'll send you stats back uh you're gonnaprice your Watson stats so as soon asyou send it to me I'll send you SATsover the lightning Network likeI thinkyeah that's certainly how the economy isgoing to work in the future it alreadyis working that wayum podcasting 2.0um it's justat what point the the tentacles ofBitcoin extend throughout the wholeeconomy it's going to take timeyeah and so yeah definitely agree thaton its own it's its own independentsystem and that other people who useBitcoin for other different reasons areits other systems right they're theirown independent systems and there issome boundary where they're connectedbut that doesn't mean that Bitcoinwouldn't necessarily be that they're thesame it's just here's the core thing andother people are using parts of it asits own independent system and there'smaybe like a boundary or you know youcouldwhen it comes to systems you can put thecontext or the boundary anywhere youwant it but yeah it by itself Bitcoin isis its own entity as this thing thattransfers bits ofum we can call them coinsutxs yeahOkay soyou can but we have established thatthere are securitythere are ways to use that for securitypurposeslike it's undeniable that this couldchangehow people choose to secure theirsoftwareit might not be inherent exclusively tothe Bitcoin Network itself it might beit's like an independent thing but itwould still be attachedbecause it's still requiring that youcan see where the security comes in likethe paywallpay get something in returnyepI think it could be [ __ ] it could havebad like your website could have badsecurity it could still have uh someshitty database code written that allowssomebody to inspect element or I don'tknow how it happens but get access toumuser information emails whateverlike that's not because you can't justput a paywall andall that security magically manifestyeahum it like we can get into SoftwareSystem security butlike kind of what I said alreadyis Software System security isfundamentallysomeone sent a control action which putthe system in a hazardous state so howdo you prevent someone from executing anunsafe control action maybe they shouldhave sinned it but they didn't or theyshouldn't have sent it but they did orthey sent it for too long or they sentthat control action for Too Short eithercase if you collateralize or if youprevent that control signal from beingsubmitted unless it's accompanied byBitcointhen technically what you have done isnot apply a logical constraint which ishow software is normally secured you'veapplied a physical constraintthat's a logical constraint both it's alot of people saying like you don't getthis unless you give me five sets yeahit's both yeah so if the logic is youdon't get it unless you collateralizewith Bitcoin but Bitcoin itselfismachine code applied to quantities ofpower so like Bitcoin cannot betransmitted unless materially largequantities of physical power are changedthey change their stateand this physical constraintagreed butagain so like again difficultyadjustment hash rate fluctuates so let'sjustzoom out hash rate can fluctuate it hasbeen fluctuating it's been going downthe price of bitcoin's been stablelast week so technically for going offthis example likecompared to last week the price ofBitcoin is about the samebut you need uhwe had an upward difficulty adjustmentlast week so you need a little bit morepower to get this transaction confirmedbutyou knowing monetary value thattransaction is the same and so this thisreminds me a lot of the big meme thatwent around years ago or that Bitcoinmining is a battery which is not trueyou expend the energy you create thehashgreat trillions of hashes one of one ofwhich allows you to add a block ofum transactions to The Ledger butthere'syou're not like again when you'reunlocking that pay wall as a user yesthe Bitcoin network is expending energyto order transactions and propagateblocks but Ithis connection ofumlike powerbeing expressed doesn't it make sense orisn't it accurate to say that it can'tbe like people literally don't have thewatts to 51 attack like the reason whyit's secure against a 51 attack isbecause not just the hash but you alsoliterally need the Watts like you justneed the power to do it you just don'thave it so that right there is aphysical constraint it's not constraintlogically because you know exactly howto exploit the logic you just literallycan't do it because you don't have thewatts to do it even if you had all thehat like if you have a bunch of s19s doyou actually have the power to do it ifyou don't then that's a physicalconstraint that's completely differentthan how most software is secured yeahand again that'sspecific the Bitcoin not theother softwares that areuh implementing it as a payments Gatewaybut if you usebut because it requires so much power tochange the state of The Ledger to addanother blockwith the etxosbecause it requires so much power if youlogically constrain the execution of asoftware control action to bitcoinit says this cannot take place unlessthis transaction hits the base layerthen what like unless I see this paymenton the blockchain this Command actioncannot take place then because it takesa materially large quantity of physicalpower to change the state of The Ledgerand because that's coupled to thecontrol action required to change thestate of the software then what you'vetechnically done is you've not onlylogically constrained it but you'veapplied a physical cost because thatstate cannot change unless thematerially large quantity of watts isexpended to solve the to find the knotsor do whatever else is required to getconsensusagain I think they're distinct andseparate because again that'slike Diet trying to like think throughthis logically I guess some transactionstake longer to confirm than others mayyou and pull may be full you may bewaiting 100 blocks instead of twoum yeah and then on top of that thoseblocks are confirmingthousands potentially tens of thousandsof transactions orum hundreds of thousands of paymentsrepresented by one similar transactionso to try to equatetheall the energy consumption or all theenergy conversion that goes into findingthe hashthat adds a block that your transactionis confirmed into this oneGateway it justit does not compute for meum yeah I mean that's just one use caseI could think of there's there's otherones there is of course theorange check idea again if you choose tostrictly only look at Bitcoin as only acoin these will get paywall these looklike paywalls or these look at like waysto make it too expensive inin monetary valueto uh for example like run a bot farmand spam a bunch of bots I think thatwas like the yeah it's all the monitorbut that's justbut like you can measure the value of ofBitcoin in Wattsbecause it is digitized Wattsso likethat's just some I I think you can Ithese are all theories that could be Imean here but we have hash valueum so you have hash values metric uhsets per Terra hash per dayright now it's300 and then look at how many watts perterahash yeah agreed like you can dothat but again it's it's money at theend that you're just changingI think that's eventually what willhappenum yeah but again it's still money theSATs are money measured in wattsyeah I agreeum but likethe watts are unlike like alike a machine so like unlike steak orunlike an eths are like you said our watts areconvertible to wattseth is an imaginary BS thing it doesn'tphysically exist in any material realform it's just totally an abstractionapplied to State changes in a computerand so that's the difference is it'sactually hugely remarkable that youcan't even make that conversion betweenSATs to Terra hash or Terra hats to whatwhat's that's likegoing back to Nicola Tesla and HenryFordyeah I agreeum yeahbut again but it goes back to see this Ithink this is where we disagree is likewhatdrives the value is it the energy or isit the token that the energyuh gets you at the end of the day as aminor so like that'swhat drives the value is Bitcoin ismoney it's perfect money it's the bestmoney we've ever seen and that's why allthis electricity isbeing expended to facilitate thecontinuation of blocks being producedyeah so and I think that's where mypoint of view is so unique is I seeBitcoin as powerthat the Bitcoin is is valuable for thesame reason strength is valuable is isthe same reason why military power isvaluable is because the more power youhave the more ability you have to keepsomething secure the more ability youhave to decrease the benefit to costratio of attacking a certain thing andpeople like security and so Bitcoin isproof of its own Merit as a securityprotocol and if you have something supersecure that can't be systemicallyexploited by anybody then obviously thatquantity of bits would double as afantastic thing to monetize because itwould create the most secure system andthen the most secure money that you'veever seenagain it's onlygot all that wattage all that securitybecause the token has value because it'sgood moneyI know it's like a we got this Loopright well no I mean this is no it's nota loop this has been a very ongoingdebate in the history of Bitcoin whatwhat leads what hash rate or priceum price price leads hash rateit's undeniableum we're seeing it right now the priceis going down hash rate is fallingbecause it's unprofitable to my Bitcoinso people have to turn off becausethey're running businesses that yeahthey cannot run them profitablyumbitcoin price guys that token price goesup people start plugging monitors backin because that token has more value andit makes economic sense to to plug yourA6 back inhere's an interesting thought becausebecause I understand the maybe therelationship between hash rate and andprice has anyone donethe relationship between total watts andpricelike how many total lots are spent overthe network and then what the totalvalue of the network is because that Ithink that would be interesting would bebut how could you calculate it rightbecause of the fact that I knowmissionless yeahum yeah you don't know you don't know sobut the point is a theory could be thatmaybe it'sum maybe there's a direct correlationthere there could be it could beuh it seems like it's using more powerthan it did before and it's also morevaluable so maybe there's we'veuncovered some weird complexrelationship that has been at play forthousands of years but it's never beenmore explicit than now that we haveBitcoinyeahand by the way this wouldn't beunprecedented because it's no secretthat usually the most powerful Nationshave like thethe world observed currency maybe therereally is like a no kidding relationshipbetween power and valuethatthat we just are discovering as like aas like a general Humanity yeah becauseyou're starting to get some into somedeep combo here I knowwell that if that were the caseVenezuela would be a world superpowerumso I think I think that was a brilliantplay I thinkum max Kaiser is gonna is a Napoleoniclevel geniusum I think that they are going to showthe world that El Salvador Nationalso I said because Venezuela's got whatlike the third largest one oh sorry ohsorry yeah the El Salvador yeah I thinkthey made a great move as well ElSalvador not only do I think they'remaking a great move for money I thinkthey're they're gonna prove to the worldthat they can stand up to a superpower anuclear superpower multiple nuclearsuperpowers okay the IMF represents allof themyes exactly and sothey are proving the point that likethis is a military-grade securitytechnology becausethe world's combined greatest militariescan't can't stop me from my Bitcoin likeit'sum I think that has a lot that willshowcase a lot of valueand maybe there is some relationshipbetween power and value and who knows ifone leads the other or if they'recompletely separate but like the pointis holy crap that's huge and holy crapyou now have an example of anation-state standing up to Globalsuperpowers on something that used to belike a fundamental thing that peoplefought over kinetically and it's justgoing to totally change the game agreedthereyeah stop talking because again they'reforcedlike the incumbent system that they'rewalking away from the dollar ReserveSystem the petrodollar systemlike you're forced toact within the rules set forth by thatmilitary-industrial complex a Bitcoinyou opt outyep in your forced to operate within therules of that distributed consensusthat but before Bitcoin you like if youhad opted out of the USD and tried to goyou would still have to be like youwould just adopt the Chinese superpowerversion or the Russian super like thepoint is people didn't have an option tonot choose a or you could be except forthey kind of did with gold but then thatgot captured so yeah back to Gold he gota knife stuck up his ass rather quicklyumthat's yeahyeahit's been a fascinating it's justit's just something to think about yeahum I know that I I I know that um Iunderstand every single argument I Iread the stuff I coded I go throughthese commentsandum andif anything just can maybe just try toconsider it as an alternative point ofviewand I'm not necessarily even trying toconvince anyone that this is the waythey should think of it I'm just tryingto convince the people that it's likehey you've got to understand that thishas major implications Beyond money thisisgoing to change the way that humansorganize it's going to change the roleof government it's going to changethe necessity of our traditionalmilitary industrial complex I I couldtotally agree with all that stuff Ithink and I'm I'm testing out theseideas in public and they're they areresonating they are helping some peopleget orange pills soonerum and I know that it's like scary tothink about it but maybe just considerthe the arguments that that I made onwhylike it's totally legit to beconcerned but like just think thatthroughbecausethere could also be benefits to it thatare worth consideringyeah no I agree I think Bitcoinjust already has changed energy it'schanging payments changingpodcasting kind of changemany other thingsum but again that's why they fix themoney fix the world it fixes thesethings because it's better and it forcespeople to act differently they cannotthen the opportunity cost ofmisallocating capital is going toincreaseso high that people are forced toactually produce good [ __ ] and providevalue to the world they can't justsit there and ride the gravy train thatis the money printer anymore they'reactually gonna have to sit down andthat's how Bitcoin impacts the world inmany different facets Beyond moneyum because we have a good money allthese other facets of our life improvebecause people are forced to produce abetter good in serviceif we do chooseso one other benefit that I didn'tmention is by Framing it when I frame itas a cyber security technologythen I immediately undermine theauthority ofthe treasury Department and the FederalReservebecause they're not qualified to betalking about the Merit of cybersecurity technologythey should not be in charge of thenational especially a conversation aboutthe national strategic implications ofof this cyber security technology Iwould argue they're not qualified totalk about money either yeah that's afair argument of those systems as well Idon't think I don'tI don't think I hate the federalgovernment I don't I do not like them Idon't think they provide valueand that's what again so I guess we canwrap this up with meumjustexplain my point of view which is Idon't think we shouldparticularlywith the weapons grade munitionsstatus of Bitcoin I think that providesthe federal government who is set tolose out massively in a world in whichBitcoin succeeds with an arrow in thequiver of an attack Vector with ohyou plebs are using weapons gradeMunitions we actually have to step inexecutive order we can't allow this itis a national security threatbut that would be true for foreignerstoo it would be true for all people soyou could just as easily say holy crapeveryone's you figured out how to usethis we mustwe must stockpile it we must be good atthis because this is if we want tocontinue to be and so I think we justdon't want to get pigeonholed into theidea of only the United States againstonly its own government because this isa global thing okay so if we make thatargument it would say hey we can'tafford to let China and Russia have moreof this than we do or like that would bea a primary concern agreed but I alsothink our government has helped bent onrepeating the Chinese social creditscoring system exporting that here toUnited States I don't think thesociopaths in charge of our governmentreallycare about that they see China's controlover their populace and get enviouscome out and send it and it's not theexact terms but this has beenarticulated by people in the defensedepartmentthe if Bitcoin is what I think it is itdoesn't matterit doesn't agree it's not a this is nota negotiationit like they're gonna yeah so come tothe private sector stop trying to helpthem out just comecome work on the energy sector inBitcoin and uhit's tempting it should hey umbefore I go I oh the umI wanna I owe the people all the peopleI blocked in explanationsso I thought you were going toumbe like how is it possible that you'renot a spook on this like governmentsanction site psychological operationI'm surprised you didn't ask me that Imean or like why is and I know that'slike an understood like assumption thatyou're making but and you know why Ieven bothered to get me to try toexplain why I'm not because why would ityou should be not trust sweet nottrusting mebut one explanation for anyone who'slistening that just can't come up with aa viable explanation for why I becamesuddenly so discussed so quickly isbecause I think there is like a symbolicrelationship happening wherepeople's likelike hatred against the state or atleastyou know like they're discontent withcertain words I think that is likeactually causing me to become morediscussed or like bring more attentionto meyeah like well so yeah so essentiallywhat I wanted to prove was likeI can show you that like I I like ifthis hypothesis is true then all I haveto do is what I did wasanyone who said by the way no one'sblocked I unblocked everybodyumso all you have to do to kind of likeshowcase how this phenomenon works is byusing well-known Network targeting ormarketing fixusing the systemic exploitable featuresof Twitter and so all I did was anyoneanytime anyone said an ad hominemargument so just like just not reallybeing rational just like talking crap orhad like a preachy posts of like somelike like virtue signaling thing aboutlike how War's bad or if they used anyof the top three common arguments that Iusually get so the argument that it'sdefense only the argument that itssoftware can't be used as a weapon or anargument that it was first amendment itshould be enoughI didn't block the people who made thoseassertions are made those memesI blocked only the people who echoedthose so I only blocked the likers andthe retweetersand then I liked the people who made theyou know the insults so that I could getthe feed of all the people who aremaking the ex the the insults and then Ionly liked the echoey people and so whatI was doing was I was essentiallyblocking the people most likely todisagree with me or most likely todislike me and the most likely to likeand retweet itand and it started this like likeDynamic vicious cycleyeah but but I know it's a vicious siteyou destroyed my notifications thisweekendthat's that's what happened to me I saidpeople like you blocked me I was likeI don't know so the the point is II don't that's not intentional I'm likenot trying to well in this case itliterally was because I was actuallytrying to experiment but likeI can't help it if people are liketalking about me all the time andbringing all this attention I thinkthat's why if you're trying to come upwith a viable explanation for why I keepon the Streisand effect of thebitcoinersyeah it's kind of like that yeah andthen in the process what I was hoping todo is show that like you can usedefensive only tools as an offensivetactic because I was targeting youI was targeting your network and justtrying to like force you toyou know not be able to see me and kindof just constraining you and so this isa network talking strategy and then alsoumumI'm just kind of trying to show you thatthese are the types of systemicexploitations that are happening rightnow all the time Twitter has way moredata than I can like all I can see islikes and retweets towards trackingeverything every website you go to istracking this you are being surveilledat massive scaleand you are being exploited at massivescale I just use a basic exploit that Ithat I know of but like what Twitter andFacebook and all these social mediapeople can do is extraordinary and andthey're constantly doing these socialexperiments on you without your noteyou're noticing they're constantlyrunning these a b tests on you withoutyour noticing they're figuring outwhat's causally inferable so they'reactually now able to prove that they cancreate a response not just a correlationbetween behaviors but they're actuallyexploiting you like forcing they cancause actual Behavior changes and likeso we're already in this state ofsoftware being used not just governed bygovernments but also just by commercialindustry to systemically exploit peopleat extraordinary scaleand like this is the type of thing thatBitcoin could help out withlike maybe these types of paywallscould help out with this and so that'sjust like what I'm trying to to show butbut we just have to start thinking aboutthisin um in a different way and the lastthing I I I'll say isumthe two the two reasons why this workedwas because people think alike sohomophily is a thing birds of a featherflock together so we if youare inclined to dislike me then you'reyou have a high probability of being afriend of someone who's inclined todislike me and so that's why I canproduce this like kind of Streisandeffect or at least fan that flameand then also when we talk and like ifyou go to like a like a public forum andtalk and say somethingradical softwarewhat you'll see in a normal situation isa normal distribution of responsesso on the extreme right of thedistribution there'll be people that areangry at you and on the extreme left ofthe distribution they'll people who arein support of you but most people willbe totally indifferent they'll just notcare so it's a normal distribution sothe top 10 percent are okay and so ifyou're like in a public forum that'swhat you'll see people will give youthat feedbackbut with these social algorithmsespecially when we start using socialmedia algorithms that rewards likes andretweets and and AIS that arecontrolling what we see on our feed it'sbeen proven it's very showcased there'sactually a whole book about this if youwant toif you want to read it call the hypemachinethere is a what you see online isnothing like what you experience inperson it is a J curve especially onTwitter meaning a J curve meaning on theside where there's like a lot of peopleor on the side where people agree withyou there's like a uptick then it dipsso if you're looking at the actions ofpeople on Twitter there's people who arein the Middle With Youthere it dips people who are justindifferent are doing nothing so peoplewho like you are kind of you know likingand retweeting people who don't care aredoing nothing but then the people whohate you or are angry or you know upsetfor some reason that's the other thetall side of the J so what that means isanytime you're on social media likeyou've ever wondered why you just feelangry on Twitter all the time is becausethe way the algorithm works and what yousee is the the angry peopleself-identify they're the ones mostlikely to like they're the most onesmost likely to retweet and that isdistorting our perception ofof reality in ways that we at least needto understand in ways that we couldmaybe one day fix if we can find coolerways of using things like Bitcoin to tokind of quill that stuff and and in thiscase I exploited that feature and Ibasically figured out okay the peoplemost likely to write and retweet are theones that are most angry so what can Ido to anger them will I block the onesthat like retweet and so you can startthat cycle but it is creepy how wellthat worked Marty I know that is againyou destroyedyou destroyed my mentionsand and so please just be aware thatthese risks are real these the systemicexploitation is happening now and likethese are the conversations I think areproductive aboutwhy how can we use mechanisms to fixthat because Elon Musk isn't going tofix that you can't fix that with a godking who has full control over thesoftware you would have you just have totrust him not to exploit you with itbut and you can't fix it with a bluecheck mark because of the United Statesdollar because that gives ControlAuthority to the people who control theUnited States dollar we have to findsome decentralized way of doing thiswhich I I know is like what the likewhat um Jack is after you know finallylike maybe some but like these are thethings that Bitcoin can solve these arethe things that we should be thinkingabout and uh just you know ifum I am a spook I have worked with theintelligence Community I don't deny itthat's what that's why I call youbecause you're literally a spook andthen yeah I'm literally a spook and I'mand I'mum and yeahbut I don't understand why people don'tthink that's like a transparent thing Idobut just be aware like you might beyou there might be other explanationsfor why I get so much attention thataren't triceps yeah I think I thinkthat's the most logical explanation andand I tried to kind of showcase that andI am I I'm very concerned about howeffectively it workednono I think everybody okay thank you forletting me do that to get everybody uhback on your side just have to convinceBitcoin Twitter that you're uh that yourfifth pillarthe columnum I'm gonna get you're gonna come tothe private sectorJason I would how ironic would it be ifyou converted meit's gonna happen that would be like theultimate success story for youwe're three and a half hours in hereit's been a pleasure we've talked thanksagainum yeah thanks for coming on I mean Iknow you've been getting a lot of [ __ ]some of it coming from me self incurredyeah but also some of it because I bringit on you know it's my fault that's whyI like uh I like these long long formconversations can hash it out punintendedum it's a pleasure man I'm lookingforward to our next talk I am as wellhope you uh enjoy the rest of yourMonday nightfreaks I hope you enjoyed theconversationfollow Jason at Jason P Lowryum correctyep that's itanywhere elsewe should say no not yet no just thatall right go follow Jasoneverybody enjoy the rest of your daystop stop screaming with people onTwitter go read a bookPeace Love freaks okay foreign",
