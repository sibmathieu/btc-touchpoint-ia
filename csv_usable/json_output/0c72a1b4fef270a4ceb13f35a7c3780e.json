Thompson welcome to the what ismoney showthanks for having us Robgood to have you guys here uh just byway of quick introduction you are two ofthe three founders of the Bitcoin Talentthe cowhich is I think the first recruitingfirm dedicated exclusively to bitcoinum congratulations sounds like somethingimportant for the Bitcoin spacethank youumlet's just get started with your guysindividual Journeysinto Bitcoin personally and thenprofessionallyum I know the lines get really blurredwhen you work in Bitcoin kind of likeBitcoin becomes your life life's work orpeople turn their businesses into orangekilling machines like it seems like itgets really consuming souh maybe we can start with you Andy howdid you journey into Bitcoin and thenhow did you find your way into foundingthe first Bitcoin recruiting firmsure so yeah the personal professionalside they do intertwine you know at somepoint as they do for all of us but ifstarting professionally I'll say this Imean my my entire career has been spentin recruiting so that that is mybackground it's my expertiseum I've been working here and in SiliconValley for 12 plus years now working intech companies so I was actually anearly employee at Uber way back whengoodness almost 10 years ago back whenit was actually a startup very differentthan the company we know today soworking with that team to scale you knowone of the the highest like fastestgrowth environments of any tech companyever there's an incredible experienceum also worked in agencies and thenultimately culminated to me starting myown recruiting firm back in 2020. umJanuary of 2020. all the time to start abusiness two months before uh you knoweverything points to but yeahstarted that business and and at thattime it was still very focused in thetraditional Tech landscape so my clientsat the time were you know your insertname of series a series B Venture backcompany across a pretty wide array ofIndustriesum I'll pivot to the professional sorryto the personal side because that'sactually where the the intertwiningstarts happening but for me my personaljourney to bitcoin I was curious yearsand years ago now I remember I firstbought Bitcoin perhaps back in 2017 like100 bucks on coinbase type thing but Iunfortunately didn't dive in yet yeah Ican't really call myself class of 2017right yeah I put 100 bucks there kind ofleft it went back to my day job didn'treally think about it again FlashForward to March 2020. that was reallythe bomb for me and I think againprobably the same for a lot of peoplelistening right where what the justhappened like learning so much about Imean just yeah the rabbit hole that weall go down like learning abouteconomics why why are things crateringwhat's actually happening across theglobe how is this all intertwined sojust that that journey I mean it was itreally was a bomb that went off so thatwas what two months after I had startedmy business right and so for the nextlike three years or so these journeys ofyou know me as a business owner likegrowing this this business and then wepersonally diving deeper deeper down thethe rabbit hole kept running in parallelultimately to the point where I couldhave that be the case anymore rightagain I think everyone has the storywhere you just can't have those twolives you're a Bitcoin Obsession andyour Fiat job you're you know regularlife right kind of running in paralleland so it seems so obvious now but therewas a period of a couple months probablywhere I just kept thinking man how can Ihow can I work in Bitcoin how can I howcan I support Bitcoin how can I you knownot have to like divide this life inthat way and and the light bulb justwent off it's like well I've beenbuilding a business that probably canprove relevant to the space right theycan have repositioning repurposing allthe infrastructure all the experiencethere to now support Bitcoin onlycompanies and so that that kind of seedwas getting planted towards the end of2022um thought that as as I was going tointend to launch this new like BitcoinFocus recruiting firm I wanted to takeall the learnings from my previousbusiness I've been running and do it inthe right way and what that meant to mewas actually having a strong team inplace beyond just myself so I knew Ibrought the recruiting expertise but Ireally wanted experience operating inthe Bitcoin landscape and so I reachedout to the two co-founders so I reachedout to Eric here reached out to Michaeltanguma who's our third co-founder andto these guys credit you know I reachedout as a recruiter does that coldreached out on LinkedIn it's like hey Ihave a side idea like what do you guysthink is this something that would beneeded in the space both of themimmediately yes this is great let'slet's keep chat and so very quickly fromprobably December 2022 over the holidaysinto the new year we put the foundationin place where it would become Bitcointalento we officially or unofficiallylaunched I should say like right at thenew year and then we had our publiclaunch a couple months later which Ithink it's been probably six six weeksor so now since our public launch andyeah goodness it's come together soquickly we're off and running we'resupporting clients we've filled rolesright we're doing we're doing the workwe set out to do but we know it's stillearly days so uh the excitement tofinally like mesh those two worlds theFiat life you know my traditionalexperience with my Bitcoin Obsession Imean it's just it's been the best thingever yeah the best decision ever by farthat's really cool uh just out ofcuriosity when you were going into theBitcoin rabbit holeuh was there a particularanswer to that question what is money oror perspective on money that gave youthat that helped give you the light bulblet's say was there something inparticular that resonated with you yeahthere's a couple things actually Ishould say this I mean going back to mylike my schooling I mean I was aneconomics major in college never used itnever went to accounting or anythinglike that but I had this like smallFoundation where I thought I knew whateconomics meant right very converselyyou know kind of University degree thererightum I was graduating right around 20082009 right so I saw that maybe not withthe lens as a career professional oreven an adult so to speak right so Ikind of knew it was happening but notenough and then when it all startedhappening in 2020 it was like there werethere were like things I was thatresembled what happened 2008 2009 butnow I had the lens of like having afamily having a job having a careerright so it's a really differentperspective nowum and yeah I mean there are a lot ofthings I can I can point to like youknow why you know why would certainInvestments that I'd made over the yearslooking differently now why were I whywere companies going through layoffsright I mean my my industry my fieldtech and especially recruiters haven'tforbid I mean they're the first to go atthese companies like why are thesenegative things happening when I knowthe companies are so well capitalized soit's like what is money how is moneyused right and and how is it misusedmore importantly it's misused almost bydefault because of like what money hasbecome over the past several decades soso yeah I mean this is a whole theconversation we can have right if I'mstarting to to Really and I think tothis day I'm still you know solidifyingmy decision of or my definition of whatis money but there was a big Veil liftedtype moment in March 2020 for me forsure without a doubt yeah that thatsounds like similar experience for a lotof people just the the shock and wake upcall that happenedum Eric what about you what's your yourpathway into Bitcoin personally andprofessionallyyeah sure thing so I've been workingfull-time in the Bitcoin case coming upon three years now or so but to take itback uh I was back I'd say like 2012 orso I was in high school actually and oneof my buddies was trying to buymarijuana on the dark web and he showedme this Bitcoin thing you know you haveto buy it with dollars and that's whatyou can use to to buy drugsum obviously we didn't do that but thatwas my first touch and then 2017 uh asthe market began to rise againI was in collegeum and there was a blockchain clubactually at Penn State University so Istarted attending the meetups there acouple times a month just getting a feelfor what is this I guess cryptocurrencyspace overall and honestly I just wantedto get rich like I just don't want a bigmoney here like why not buys them nowand 20x or whatever it may be and Iquickly learned that's not the case so Idabbled in the altcoin trading if youwill got wrecked and then that kind ofopened my mind to okay why is Bitcoindifferent than all the recipes thethousand plus other tokens coins so thatreally started the my journey down therabbit hole and then I remember probablylike late 2019 or soI had this Instinct I for some reason Iwanted to like learn how to start a bankother than I just looked at on thisvideo economy I was like wow all theserich dudes are all Bankers why can't Istart a bank and so I startedresearching how to do thatfound out all the barriers that were inplace to do so I was like that seemslike a lot a lot of work and that led medown to asking the same question what ismoney how is it created and why do thesepeople get to decide who can start abank who cannot who can print the moneywho can't uh yeah so that was the theimpetus I guess for my Bitcoin journeyand then as you know March 2020 comes uhMarket tanks and that really opened thefloodgates to me wanting to vote myentire career and all my time intolearning what this thing is and how Ican help itjust grow and achieve the globalstandard for what is what we know ismoney soum and one more point I wanted to maketwoum during January 2020 I actually had uhemergency surgery due to Crohn's diseaseso I was out of work for I was workingas a civil engineer and I was had towork for like six months or soand that gave me some time along withpandemic just to take a pause andI guess take a a an overview look atlike my life what I want to do with mylife and from there that's that's whatled I guess me going down the BitcoinRabbit Hole even more so at that time uhshortly after I quit my engineering joband I started a Bitcoin educationcompany called Bitcoin EDU and the wholegoal with that I think was just reallyto solidify my understanding of Bitcoinby teaching it so because if you couldteach it that means you understand it soI was helping others the friends familyand just random people on the internetreally understand Bitcoin and then fromthat uh or laid that into a job atBitcoin magazine and the Bitcoinconference so let's work at an accountmanager completely transitioned my myfunction my role so I was Transit asengineer now I'm working as an accountmanager on the business side of thingsand just yeah networking the Bitcoinspace and from there I'm putting thecontent online about Bitcoin and that'swhen Andy reached out to me cold and hesaid I have this idea for a BitcoinFocus recruiting company and obviously Isaid yeah let's do this so that I thinkthat catches us up to now and gonna behappier to be working in the Bitcoinspace with other bitcoiners it's trulysomething special yeah shout out Ericsorry real quick I want to shout outEric um yeah you talk about this a lotonline just you're encouraging people toto be active to be present to you knowestablish some kind of like you have tobuild a 10 000 Twitter following butjust put put stuff out there right andthis is a testament to that like Eric Ithought did a great job but he's one ofthe people that I was kind of followingyourself included Robert like peopleyou're just reading like yeah how howwhere can I go to learn more and I wasthere in many ways so yeah just he wasout there he was present and I reachedout to him because of it and look wherewe are now yeah yeah I was going tocompliment him on the same thing that itif there's a will there's a way right sofor anyone that's out there listening tothis that wants to get into Bitcoin butis currently working a Fiat job that youprobably don't like as much as yourideal Bitcoin job just know that there'smany people that have walked that pathand it really does come down tothe value for Value right like you'vegot to find you got to make connectionsand then try to add value to thoseindividuals that you connect with andthen just let the the Serendipity kindof take its course rightum bitcoiners tend to be very receptiveto people that are honestly you knowputting skin in the game trying to addvalue working hard all those thingsso yeah I think you're a good example ofthat Eric and uh it's it's cool to seeyou come this far and start your ownthing now soyeah what whatso again you guys are basically thefirst recruiting firm dedicated tobitcoinumand so that I mean I guess this is themission or vision is sort of related tohelping Bitcoin companies scale byfinding the right peopleum what is the state of the industrytoday likeand and where do you draw the linesbecause obviously there's you know theBitcoin industry I gotdon't know exactly which companies arein that and and excluded from thatum where where is the industry today andand how how do you circumscribe itsure I think I'll take it here uh thinkback I'd say five years ago or so therewas no lie I think every company in thespace was more of a crypto company justtrying to take advantage of the themoney being poured into the space and Ithink around the 2017-2018 time you sawa line being drawn where there werestart very Bitcoin companies Bitcoinonly companies starting to come out uhand I know Bitcoin magazine was one ofthem they put out their blog post inlike 2018 or so declaring thatum and it's I think it's been provenvery beneficial for companies that thatsay we're only working on bitcoinbecause that kind of uhthat gets rid of all the noise and andshows we're focusing on one thing that'sgoing to actually revolutionize our ourmoney as we know it today so that wasfive years ago or soum and you see more and more companiescoming out of this Bitcoin only andmaking product services around Bitcoinand now I'd say the city industry Idon't have an exact number I have anongoing list of about like 800 or socompanies that are primarily Bitcoinfocused so most these companies Bitcoinonly but I would I would also say thatyou know they might make additionalproducts likeuh touching on ethereum or any otheraltcoin but still their their primaryfocus is Bitcoin so I would considerthem a Bitcoin company so to me anycompany that is making a product servicedoing anything to accelerate theadoption of Bitcoin not hinder itum is a Bitcoin company and we arelooking to help them hire because Iguess our overall mission is if you ifwe bring in the best talent around theworld to develop Bitcoin products andservices that's only going to speed upadoption worldwide so the degree towhich we can help do that is that thefaster hyper break organization is goingto happenyeah but we talk about a lot internallylike what where do we draw the line youknow change your words are what whatwould be a relevant client what wouldnot be I mean the truth is there thereare enough Bitcoin online companiestoday to to have a good business rightnow obviously we want to do more andcontinue to expand upon that so what wethink of like yes there's there's thethe rivers the swans there's Bitcoinexclusive Hardware products and thoseare obvious we all know those right nowif you're in a world where like Bitcoinis the focus you dabble in other coinsperhaps yeah it's Eric's Point likemaybe you're not our primary you knowclient but if you come to us it's morelike how you position your needs if youcome to us saying like genuinely want tohire someone to develop you knowsomething on the lightning Network forour product that touches other thingsyeah that's fair if you come to us thatsame company with you know multipleenvironments they come to us and say heywe need solidity developers thanks butno thanks you know it's just just we'llbe honest with you that's not what we doright so we're not we're not furtheringother you know development on otherchange or other spaces right we arehiring Bitcoin Elite Talent for Bitcoinonly companies or for other companiesthat hire Bitcoin Talent if that makessense and this becomes more relevant Ithink down the road where I think manyof us think this right there's there'sthis idea that like Bitcoin itself itbecomes so ubiquitous where it's notjust like a Bitcoin on a company likeevery company has to integrate Bitcoinin some way right and so whether it'straditional finance company or even ayou know like an old you know techcompany right who is now finallyunderstanding what's one seeing thelight when they want to hire BitcoinTalent we'll support them we certainlywill right but right now in this earlystage I mean all the clients on ourroster will say right they're Bitcoinonly companies and it'll probably bethat way for some time rightwhat of theplacements and clients you're workingwith is there a certain maybe like apercentage breakdown is it like 50engineering 20 accounting like what whatis what are you seeing right now interms of what jobs are being posted andplaced I I do love this question becauseit's it's helpful for the market broadlyto understand what's happening so againstate of the industry this is thistouches on that as wellum ballpark here probably 50 50 I'd saybetween Tech and non-text well simplifythem that way but but why that's reallyexciting is because in past Cycles itwas probably nearly 100 Tech and notthat that's a bad thing but at thisearly stage in the infancy of theindustry I know these companies likeyeah engineering is King I think we cansay that that's not a bad thing but whatwe're seeing now is companies that werefounded in past Cycles are now reachingcertain levels of maturity where theyneed a more robust team across you knowFinance accounting sales marketingeverything that's that's outside ofengineeringum and so but yeah we're even in the inthe stage right now where hiring overallis not as as high as it was near as pastfor all Industries it's not just Bitcoinright we're still seeing diversityacross roles which is great and so yeahI'd say 50 50 between Tech and non-techat this point we're also seeing a gooddiversity in terms of leveling of rulesso again these companies that are maybematuring at this point are hiringlegitimate seasoned execs we're alsostill seeing obviously a ton of entrylevel opportunities so yeah the point tomake is that if you're at home thinkinglike how do I get into space I'm not anengineer I don't know you know Bitcoincore or lightning development kit likeanything like that like that's okay whatdo you do what experience do you comewith let's yeah figure out how we canmatch that to what's available in thespace todayyeah one thing I want to add realquickly to in the city industry is thelast few years we've seen a a rise ofBitcoin only VC company yes which isgreat so now pair that with the last fewyears Bitcoin companies have beeninvesting heavily engineering r dbuilding out the products they're readyto go to market and they have access toCapital now through these Bitcoin or VCSso pair that with yeah it's just theperfect storm right now to really launchthis industry into the mainstream and Ithink that's what's happening in realtime right now hmmyeah that's a group of point so I meanobviouslyBitcoin only VCS coming online fundingthese startups these startups that needto go higherum that they tend to carry the sameethos as the funders right so they'relooking for Bitcoinuh I guess orange pill candidatesessentiallyum what is okay in terms of likedifferentiatingBitcoin recruitment from something likea bitcoinerjobs.comwhich I think is more like just a jobboard what how what is thedifferentiation between those two uhbusiness modelsI think it's it's a pretty cleardifferentiation but I'd say that bothare important right and yeah tip of thecap to bitcoiner jobs they've beenaround for several years they've beenyou know someone I've looked to in thespace we've all looked into space islike the place to go if you're curiouswho's hiring in Bitcoin right that'sgreat that's that's absolutely requiredit's needed it'll continue to be neededbut in that it's just a job board itdoes it's not even half the battle Iwould say maybe this is my my trip on myshoulder My Lens like as a recruiter mytrade for you know decade plus the theconversion rate of like candidatesources if you will inbound is alwaysmuch lower compared to referrals firstand foremost which obviously drive a lotof hiring in the industry and thensecond it's the you know active sourcingof passive candidates outbound sourcingright so going to Market finding someonewho you know on paper or LinkedIn or onTwitter right seems to be the great fitand then pitching them about the worldthat they may not have heard about yetso that that's like that's the value webring that's the recruiting team orrecruiting agency does is going toMarket to find the right talent for youand so yeah we're really tapping thesame problem I'd say from from twodifferent angles right posting jobshaving visibility it's great for thesignal right but then now us like reallydoing the the heavier lifting of likegoing to Market defining candidatesthat's that's just going to augment thepipeline it's going to bring the rightkind of talent that are tailored to yourrole based on like our whole intakeprocess to understand your needs rightum and so I think that's that's the thegeneral difference between the twoRico are you applying any I know youhave a background in recruiting so areyou applying any of the methodologies orFrameworks that you use in traditionalrecruitinginto this and it if so like is itdifferent at all in what you're doing inBitcoin or is it trying to take thosesame tried and true methods and justapply it to a Bitcoin Focus spaceyeah I mean sure that process wise againit's it's the same yeah and I thinkthere's now these are processes orthings you learn over over you know adecade plus over a career right you knowhow to run a process how to make sureit's a Equitable interview process thatcan efficiently you know parse out whatyou're trying to find how are you beingmindful of like metrics around time andprocess and quality of candidatesquality of process like there's a lot ofthings we get thrown around like reallyyou know granular recruiter metrics andprocesses rightum but the the special part is like youknow focusing on an industry in whichyou're passionate and then obviouslylike a space that you know as we've saidhasn't really had this kind of supportrecently so yeah I mean not giving awayour secret sauce here but like we're notReinventing the wheel we're recruitingas a profession has existed for fordecades and recruiting firms have beensuccessful businesses for decades rightum sometimes the most successful onesare industry specific or even likediscipline specific for us you knowtaking taking that kind of like nuggetit's it's yeah yeah we're certainly ableto offer a high level value by beingBitcoin focused only the process thetools you know the everything we bringto the table like to actually get thejob done is similar to what you'd see inother environments but we just have thislike

earlier likekind of post block size Wars 2017 therewas this you knowprior to that every company was kind ofa crypto company and then post that westarted to see Bitcoin only companiesBitcoin only VCS Bitcoin only recruitingfirms so there was this distinctseparation I think between Bitcoin andcryptowell how where do you see thatdistinction going into the future isthis something that's going to continueto diverge wider and wider uh it youknow will there eventually be cryptofocused recruiting companies versusBitcoin focused recruiting companieslike how do you guys anticipate thatgoing well it's already hard yeah theyalready are there's quite a few actuallythe recruiting firms focus in more ofthe broader crypto spacebut the way I think about it is it'smore High Time preference thinking surethese recruiting firms they can go andhire and engineer let's say for a 300000 role they collect a big fee off ofthat they can place those all day rightnowbut over the long term I think those aregoing to fizzle out and the more loadtime preference thinking is thinkingabout working like focusing your energyon bitcoin so Bitcoin jobs right nowmight not pay the mostum but as the Bitcoin price acceleratesI think needs for hiring will onlyincreaseyeah that's funny I mean that that spacehas been more saturated for quite sometime now there are several Terex Pointrecruiting firms in there before us yeahfocused on that slides that's why Ialways say when people ask us you guysin the first yeah we're the first and itblows my mind that we're drawing theline the first to draw the line in thesand same Bitcoin only right because ofhow much support the the other side ofthe fence has but again maybe it's justTestament to how early we are and wethink it's so obvious that we should befocusing on this but that's not the caseyou know generally speaking across theindustry right now which which again issurprising um and so what I seehappening too to to piggyback up Eric'spoint it's like there'll be some sort oflike circling back coming back to thefold like some of the companies likeother chains will just die right they'lljust go away all together and all thefunding they've raised will justevaporate you know that's whatever thesepeople learn their lesson right butthere will be some companies hopefullywho have been in that space and thenthey do want to kind of pivot to comeback to bitcoin right so it's not likewe're just cutting half of thisearthquake has happened and we'll nevermerge again right there will be somecompanies and and individuals as welllike people who are engineers andethereum companies or yeah marketers atnft marketplaces whatever like thosefolks will also eventually some of themwill see the light when I come back andI would say we would welcome them withopen arms like you've already shown upyeah a willingness to jump into a newtechnology and try it you chose thewrong one we could all right right butif you're yeah yeah seeing the lightyeah accepting Bitcoin now as yoursavior right then you come back to theto the side of the fence like that'sthat's great yeah we want that Talenttoo so just like sorryone more point I want to make about itis I know Robert you're not the biggestfan of governments uh but thegovernment's actually helping us youknow in the Bitcoin industry in a wayright now the recent Crackdown of theSECum it's basically labeling every othercryptocurrency as a security and makinga distinct stream Bitcoin is a commodityI think if we play that out over thenext decade or so yeah you're gonna seeway less funding into the space so lessfunding means less companies being builtin crypto overall and a lot of the thetalent is going to be more focused inBitcoin uhyeah that's a good point Idefinitely not although I am making thedistinction now which we always usethese terms as if they areinterchangeable the government and thestate but they're really not the samething government is you know governancerules contracts this whole Nexus ofagreements but the state is thatinstitution that'sinstitutionalizing plunder right they'reactually aggressing against privateproperty or aggressively enforcinglegislation by Fiat so there'sdefinitelyI'm trying to be better about thatreally focus the the vitriol at thestate not government per se becausegovernment is something that's necessaryfor so when you put the SEC and likemore government bucket then no I thinkthey're more State because a lot of it'slegislation by Fiat right they passthese very arbitrary rules and then theyforce them on companiesum you know the big argument is consumerprotection maybe there's some need forthat at some level but the way I look atit is if it's notyou know it's it's life liberty andproperty so there's not an activedeception or an active theft occurringthat the realm of government the scopeof government should not even beinvolved government exists to preservelife liberty property nothing elseum a lot of these laws that the statepasses they're not you know that we'rebuilt on the English common lawtradition which is likewe see disputes happening over longperiods of time we see how differentgroups resolve themand then we sort of codify that into lawit's like a legal Discovery process it'snot like there's one guy that comes upand like writes a law and that's thething it's this has been going on forhundreds of years here's how we'veresolved it and now we're codifying thatinto law slowly over timethat's natural well that's Englishcommon law something closer to naturallawbut legislation by Fiat is there's a guyin office and he says you know Hammurabiuh 250 000FDIC Insurance limit you know just thesearbitrary things that can be essentiallyGary Gensler yeah exactly they'll comeinto being with one guy in office andthen the next guy will repeal it and putsome other arbitrary law it makes thingsvery confusing and very subject to humanerror and Corruption and all thesethings so I think all of that just needsto goumbut uh to the to your point thoughI guess it is and this is sort of like abenefitof crypto for Bitcoin is that itprovides this kind of smoke screen likea lot of the regulatory energies aredevoted to squashing these crypto scamsrather than trying to to squash Bitcoinor disadvantage Bitcoin somehow soumit's definitely kind of an ironic weirdthing like these crypto copies that aretrying to emulate or out compete ordisrupt Bitcoin or take market sharefrom Bitcoin end up providing some coverfor it from a regulatory standpointum just reality we're living in a timewhen the state is still very powerfuland so if I mean if we have to adhere totheir rules then all right we'll take itand let them squash crypto and pave apath for Bitcoin yeah there's a counterargument that to that though that somebitcoiners hold and that isthe state would actively would have anincentive to actively promote and defendsomething like an ethereum or some otherlarge Networkthey could pretend like oh ethereum isthe next Bitcoin and they could pump alot of money into it and build someregulatory mode around it trying to getpeople to switch right and then they youcan capture and co-ops ethereum rightthat's a network that's not actuallycensorship resistant not immutable andso there's another argument there thatthere's a potential threat to bitcoinbutat the end of the day I you know I thinkit's individualactors that determine what succeeds orfails in in the broadest scope of thingsand then so the network that best servesindividual interests will will win andthat is obviously Bitcoinum there's very cautious optimism Ithink I think we all have right many ofus in the space right and then it's userexample yeah it's everything you saidabout ethereum is absolutely correctright but but I don't know if that'swhat we're seeing right there is somesense of like uh negative thingshappening to ethereum right now as itrelates to like classification securityEtc right so if if what you we've justsaid that is true about that being ableto be you know co-opted and likecontrolled and then maybe even justturned into the cbdc like if that's nothappening right now or at least nothappening so obviously does does thatgive us even more optimism or hope Imean me every optimistic maybe thinks sobut you know at the end of the dayyou're right too where it's like we justgot to keep doing what we're doing youknow on on the ground floor right tokeep using this keep driving circulareconomies to keep building companies tokeep like having more Venture Capitalcome in that's Bitcoin only like allthese little things eventually pile upwhere it's like we've read we've reacheda certain sense of size or someinflection point where like it is hardto kind of have this go away alltogetheryeah theum the old quote comes to mind is likeif you want to change things you can'tfocus your energy on destroying the oldyou have to focus on building the newand so the extent to which people justfocus on bitcoin that seems to bejust the win-win right because otherpeople also emulate your strategyuh you Bitcoin has like a moral andethical High Ground you know there'sit's because it's a decentralized it's aLevel Playing Field no one stands tobenefit at the expense of anyone else soum for all those kind of thatConfluence of reasons I think Bitcoinjust naturally went so as it has beengot a an interesting analogy for youthere too like using the idea of justblock out the noise just focus on what'simportant thrower lens what we see asbeing the biggest benefit of Bitcoin orABCs or just Capital Financial Capitalcoming into the space with the rightincentives to again support the industryin just the one industry it's the factthat we we will start to break awaysomewhat from these you know on averagefour-year price Cycles right likeBitcoin goes up everyone wants to workin the space companies are spendingmoney they're hiring Bitcoin goes downthey leave everyone off like we've seenit up and down now uh when a companyraises a let's say a 50 million dollarseries B right likethey in the same way don't really careabout the the noise in this case themacroeconomic Cycles or even the Bitcoinlike price Cycles they have 50 millionin the bank they know what they need tobuild their hedge down building thatthey're hiring the teams to do that andthis will start to happen you know againand again and again over time where likeevery company is kind of in their ownindividual cycle now and so there willyou know I think this next Bull Run atleast from a hiring standpoint willnever cease all right we'll see someprice activity of course we will that'sjust that's kind of you know by defaultwe'll see with with Bitcoin the way it'syou know the way it's you know createdrightum but hiring I think will start in thisnext Bull Run and it and it won't slowdown for a long time which is excitingto think aboutyeah that hopefully that is the casethat these Bitcoin early stage companiesthey start to adapt to the price cycleright not getting overly optimistic inbull runs or pessimistic and Bear runsum yeah you would expect to see thathappen althoughum yeah still seeing layoffs in Bearmarkets and speaking of bear marketsthat was actually my next question iswhatobviously we're still in oneum I think a bear Marketpersist until we break the priorall-time highwhich was what sixty nine thousanddollars maybe a year and a half ago atthis point something like thatum as we're at like a thirty thousanddollar bitcoin price today so we've gotyou know a little more thanthat's right barely halfway there let'ssay not even quite halfway there from aprice perspectivewhat are the difficulties of building anew recruiting firm in a Bitcoin BeerMarket uh I assume thatagain if we're in a bear Market hiringis probably less uh rampant than itwould be in a bull market so how are youguys dealing with with the challenges ofthe bear Marketyeah the cliche is you know best time tobuild is in a bear market like peoplesaid over and over again it's yeah it'squite quite redundant now but there'ssome truth to it there really is andwhat I'll say is yes to address it rightaway I mean obviously hiring is less nowthan it was at 69 000. it's less nowthan it will be I think in six monthsrightum but what we can do right now there isa There's an opportunity I think we haveto obviously support the clients whoalready hiring right there's there'sactive work going on and that's greatyeah so we're laying that Foundationwe're building some of that successwe're building some of that you knowsocial proof If you willum but we're also having uh the time toproactively start the rightconversations on both sides of thismarketplace right so talking to theright kinds of companies who werealready getting a sense of what they'regonna need we're we're already kind ofeven leaning in a little bit to like youknow help understand how like what kindsof roles how to classify them so there'slike work we can do without like runninga search yet so that when the checkcomes in they raise around or the prright like they pick up the phone overthere already it's the the pitch thecell has already happened right it'sjust one thing to use it so again havingthose types of conversations similarlyon the candidate side I mean yeah thereare we're so blown away by like the theinbound of of interest from like reallytalented folks who are you know this isnot your average inbound just a jobSeeker I need a job because I lost myjob et cetera it's like people who areyou know really successful in theirother careers doing whatever they'redoing but they they want to move intoBitcoin only they're not going to moveunless it's to a Bitcoin company sothese kinds of folks we're actually ableto have a lot of conversations withproactively again right now to learn abit more about them you know share sharetheir story kind of understand likereally what are the best uhopportunities to keep in mind for themso that again that matchmaking processdown the line when the right rulesbecome available is that much fasterum and so yeah taking advantage of thatyou know we have a lot of thatflexibility last thing I'll say Eric cantouch on this too is just you know eveneven our own business model yes we'rerecruiting firm the core Services youknow filling roles for clients and youknow the feed-based kind of Revenuestructure there but to the extent we cancontinue to build additional productsand services on top of that that supportthe course the core business model thoseare things we're also doing right nowwhether it's an internship program oryou know more of this educationalcontent so again Eric can talk a lotabout that but there's some reallyexciting stuff you know foundationaltype work we can do to support the coreserviceyeah one one challenge came to mind isthe I guess the Bitcoin brand so duringthe all-time highs last bull market Ithink everyone was generally interestedin Bitcoin if you see the price runningup so if you think in terms of Outreachuh if I'm as a recruiter if I'm tryingto get in touch with someone let's justsay I'm trying to get in touch with anapple exec so come work in the Bitcoinspace if I reach out to them and saywant to work in Bitcoin uh when theprice is ripping I there's probably ahigher chance of them responding to mecompared to now we're kind of in thebear Market that same message may notresonate with them and just I guesssourcing overall reaching out to peoplekind of outside the industry is a littletougher because bitcoin's not as much inthe mainstream news as it was a year ortwo agoyeah that's a good point you mentionedthe educational content are you guysactually putting out some educationalstuff too like how I assume that wouldjustkind of the General Orange pillingstrategy which is good forum cultivating new candidates what areyou guys doing like podcasts writtenmaterial like what what approach are youdoing there yeah I could touch one thatso I guess what we're doing with BitcoinTalent cow we have a podcast every weekI'm interviewing someone working in theBitcoin industry uh explaining whattheir process was like getting intoBitcoin uh their job search process whatwas the interview likeum and then what's it like withnavigating within a Bitcoin companycompared to working in the field worldif you will so that's one thingum we're putting out a newsletter calledproof of Industry so that's just takinga snapshot of the industry what's goingon what do the new company launchesproduct updatesum yeah who's working in Bitcoin andthen on the personal side of things aswell I'm putting a lot of content on mymy personal social media profiles justsharing tips and advice for how peoplecan break into the industry so I think alot of people right now are they love towork in Bitcoin and they're submittingtheir resumes along with a stack of athousand other resumes for one job andthey're not getting a call back so howdo you get a call back you got to go yougot to go beyond just submitting yourresume yeah so I'm just putting outadvice like how how can you get yourfoot in the door with Bitcoin companiesand one more thing comes to mindactually that Annie touched upon uh yeahwe are building out additional I guessproducts around our core recruitingservice that will help bring in moretalent to the industryso uh one day I'm actually working onright now is a Summer Event a summerinternship programand that's essentially gaining access toall the bright Minds in universities andthat are maybe a little bit curiousabout Bitcoin so one convincing themthat Bitcoin is something that theyshould highly consider dedicating theircareer to getting them up to speed on ituh having them understand there's adifference between crypto and Bitcoinand what that looks like in the futureand then as well yeah just providingopportunities so partnering with Bitcoincompaniesum to match students with uh jobs in thespace that hopefully lead to full-timeopportunities so uh in my mind theinternship programs really specialbecause you're kind of orange pilling awhole cohort now of let's just say 18 to22 year olds into my bet about Bitcoinand they're gonna go and tell theirfriends about it tooyeah that makes a lot of sense you gottagotta get a mother young as they say andI think the younger generation toothey're more digitally yeah and theythey understand it yeah that's moreintuitive compared to older Generationsthat take some more timeyeah I've had an intuition for a whilethere was going to come a point whereBitcoin is just so abundantly obvious toyounger Generations right once it's beenaround like especially forsay a kid that's grown up or bitcoin'salways been a thing or it's alwaysexistedum and hopefully you know the contentall of us bitcoiners produce coupledwiththe the failings and pain inflicted bythe fiat currency complex likeeventually kids are just gonna be likethis is so obvious that it won't even bea debate by you know I don't know whatage maybe these kids are college ageprobably 18 to 25that there wouldn't even be like no onewould believe in fiat currency be soabundantly obvious having grown up withthe two Alternatives which one issuperiorum I don't know how long that will takeright bitcoin's only 14 years old somaybeit's like now plus 20 years or 15 yearsI'm not really sure but it seems to mehighly probable that that that day willcomeyeah I agree but it's not going toaccelerate that uh I'm trying my bestyeah same same and the topic itself isis actually something I think aboutoften it's pretty near and dear to menow just let me give in fact I have ayoung son right you know and andthe whole lens of like okay what doesthat world look like for him right andhow do I teach him what money is earlyon in a way that perhaps it by no faultof my parents right but justunderstanding lessons you know knowledgeI didn't have until much later until Ifound it the hard way right and so tothe extent that that this nextGeneration if you will of bitcoiners youknow kind of kind of has us instilledand and have the right kind ofyeah yeah lessons early onum then yeah it's obvious like they grewup with it because they saw it in theirhouse they saw it being used they heardtheir parents talking about it you knowand I think that's very exciting for thefuture too yeah agreedum back to the educational topic Andy Ithink you wrote a blog post titled whyBitcoinyeah it was um yeah more just myimmediate you know why did I even decideto do this there's a bit of a whyBitcoin theme broadly underneath likewhy decided to start a Bitcoinrecruiting focused firm rightum but um well we can like separate usinto the education piece there's a lotof things we continue to do above andbeyond some of the stuff that Ericshared where it's like yeah opening thetalent pool yeah helping the orange pillfolks are like the right you know theright fit discipline wise but maybe notlike culturally bitcoiners yeah theydon't understand it yet so that's yeah aseparate thing we could have built outbut some of that that I touched on in myin my blog post I mean there's thisGeneral notion that again I think thisis widely held we all feel this wayright but Bitcoin itself will slowly butsurely absorb the wealth from all oftheir asset classes and so my kind oflike uh my hypothesis is that of courseit will track the top talent from otherIndustries too right uh now yeah wecould argue that neither things areguaranteed right Bitcoin itself thesuccess of Bitcoin is not gay there's alot of work we have to continue to doand so in the same way like justexpecting people by default to seeBitcoin as as like the right place to bein is also not a given but by starting acompany like this and by putting outsome of the educational content you knowwe we will we will get to that pointwhere people seeBitcoin has the thing they need to beworking on right and so yeah the bigthing that comes into this too and againmaybe part of the the value propositionfor us as a firm it's like as theseBitcoin only companies in the futurestart to grow and start to have morerecognition and start building thesesystems to like engage attract andretain the right Talent like then itbecomes more of a competitiveenvironment and that's that's somethingmaybe we're not yet seeing in the spacebut I've certainly seen in my formerlife especially like the general techindustry right where you know Googleversus Facebook versus meta or versusUber right like how they have to competefor talent like that that will be maybea little sign that we've kind of we'vekind of won in some ways too where allthe best people are already they'realready in this space they want to behere but now the companies themselveshave to buy for the right Talent soagain education is the first step to getpeople into the spaceum and I see it just fulfilling like allthese hypotheses we have around you knowof uh the the talent eventuallymigrating here to the space as well thatmakes sense yeah before we move on to uhone thing I want to touch upon was ouronboarding product that we're buildingout too so companies that work with usum if you're bringing someone out to theindustry that's let's just say they'resuper talented marketer right they'reworking in Tech they don't have theBitcoin education as muchwe want to be able to show them the pathuh how Bitcoin works and why it'sculturally important so when you come toa Bitcoin company we can essentiallyplug in our system to get them up tospeed on Bitcoin in a very quick way sothen they're effective not only theirjob but understanding the market overalltoo so yeah some initiatives are aroundonboarding huhwe see that being actually much morevaluable when it's umso let's say down the line we're inanother bear run or bull cycle sorry andcompanies are hiring they're notsacrificing the requirement per se oflike everyone coming in needs to be abitcoiner but again they're just firingin such a volume where they're just youknow like 20 engineers at a time arejoining or you know full marketing teamsbeing built out like just to be sure andto be safe there's still some kind oflike onboarding as a company would dojust for their own like company policiesbut onboarding just to make sure likeyes we all really do in fact have thesame Foundation of understanding of likea Bitcoin 101 or like how our companyplays into the overall ecosystem rightum and so that's yeah that's somethingsuper important also relevant for likelet's say the the use case we mentionedof like the larger companies who aretraditional companies but eventuallyunderstand why they need to have aBitcoin strategy or hire Bitcoin Talentrightum there could be a world where some ofthose teams also just need to likerescale existing Talent at thosecompanies right and so orange pillingexisting employees in your organizationthat is definitely something we foreseehappening at the larger organizationsand so to the extent we can provide thatvalue too maybe we're not hiring net newroles for them but we're still likehelping to educate their existingWorkforce on what Bitcoin is and and howto understand it yeah we want to we wantto be there to provide that service toothat's coolumnow I'd like to tell you about oursponsor Bitcoin conference 2023this three-day event will be held May18th through 20th in Miami Beach this isgoing to be the biggest event of theyear as it always is and the past twoyears Miami have simply been amazing dayone's industry day days two and threeare going to be open to generaladmission and I'd say this is a greatplace to go and network with bitcoinersor even look for a job just a reallyall-around great experienceis a fantastic speaker lineup includingMichael Saylor Zoltan pozar Lynn AldenAlex gladstein many others and last yearwe did a 10 million stats giveaway forthis event and we're going to do itagain this yearso to get discounted tickets and enterfor a chance to win 10 million SATs goto b.tc conference and use codeBreedlove now I'd like to tell you aboutour sponsor casa Casa makes it simple tobuy and secure your Bitcoin withoutwondering whether you're doing it rightspecifically Casa provides a multi-keycustody solution which is by far themost secure way to custody your Bitcoinnow when I talk about Bitcoin beingtheft proof money or invaluable privateproperty a multi-key custody model isexactly what I am talking aboutusing multiple Keys lets you maintainfull control of your Bitcoin while alsogiving you redundancy in case you loseone of the keys it's also the best wayto secure your Bitcoin for inheritanceplanning purposesso go tokeys.kasa that's c-a-s-a today to signup and use discount code read love okayback back on the educational sub andthis one is kind of personal to mebecause uh Eric you posted this threadabout how you got into Bitcoin which Iwas obviously a part ofum I think that it's a Twitter thread Ithink it did pretty welland it's a good case study for I guesswhat we're talking about here right isthat if you aresomeone living in a Fiat job but you'rea bitcoiner at heart and you're tryingto find your way in I mean where there'sa will there's a way and Eric your yourstory sort of proves thatum could you tell us a little bit aboutthat for those who aren't familiar withit sure thing yeah so I think as Imentioned in the beginning I was workingas a civil engineer Post University andhonestly I just skated it um the workwas okay I think the people I wasworking with they just seem kind of morelikeNPCs in a way I hate to say that eventhough they're smart Engineers they justlike wanted to show up get the work doneand just like talk about footballwhatever and just go home all of asetting was gray uh there was actually arule in my office that you weren'tallowed to get up and talk to someoneelse like a co-worker about non-workrelated stuff for like more than fiveminutes they're just like you can't dothat I was like well that's how youabsolutely destroy a culture me lookingI mean I'm in my 20s I'm like do I haveto do this for the next 50 yearswhatever it is in my life we're a tirethis seems like hell honestly yeah uh soyeah that drove me to just wanting towork in Bitcoin something I'm verypassionate about how can I marryum uh my professional life withsomething I'm very passionate though andthen like so what I did is I cold dm'dRobert when I think he probably had like20 30000 followers at the time on Twittervery very small compared to what youhave nowum and I just said I think the exactquote was like hey can I work for youfor free I don't really care what I'mdoing doesn't matter and you suggestedyeah sure just join my uh my telegramgroup uh maybe helpuh contribute to discussions there maybehelp with editing the book and workingon whatever it may be but I jumped inthere uh started networking with peoplein the group network with people onTwitterum and then shortly after I think thethe Bitcoin Congress in Miami was comingup and this is in early oneyeah yeah and so we propose this idea Ifroze to you and I was like why don't wedo this in person kind of meet up as asatellite event at the conferencebecause there's a ton of people thatwould love to talk about a little moreof the philosophical side of Bitcoin inperson I don't know that's way betterthan over texts over the internetso that we got to work I mean I think weput on a very successful event thatfirst year and that part laid into asecond event the year after Bitcoin 2022where I helped you um put together thatevent with Jordan Peterson so yeah Ithink the story really is if you want tobreak into the Bitcoin space try toprovide value in any way that you canand network and that's exactly what Idid now here I am uh on your podcast sothat's the uh the lesson there yeahthat's a greatit really is that simple I mean not thatit's easy obviously there's a lot ofwork required butI thinkmy assessment at least of the Bitcoinculture is that it is value for Valueright peoplea lot of honesty like even brutalhonesty a lot of hard-working a lot ofhard work a lot of reverence Spore valueso it's like you know if you justjust seek to add value not even likelooking out for your own what you'regoing to take necessarily and it justkind of comes back to you like theculture will will recognize and respectand reciprocateum and it really I mean again I I reallythink it's that simple I don't and notthat it's easy again it's hard you'vegot to do the pay the dues and do thework and all that but I really think theBitcoin community in general is uh isreceptive in that wayso true yeah couldn't agree moreum okayshifting back to the the recruiting firmyou mentioned so more and more I guesslet me ask this first soare we moving into a world where becauseI think of Bitcoin as something like theinternet like we often analogize it tothe internet right the internet of moneyetc etcmost companies today are they areinternet companies in one way or anotherlike even if you have nothing to do withthe internet you're definitely using theinternet as integral to your operationsdistribution Communications Etcum are we moving into a world that'ssimilar for Bitcoin where all companiesjust become Bitcoin companies in a wayeven if they're not anywhere nearBitcoin per se do you guys I think justthink about that yeah I think 100 wekind of touched on this earlier but yeahyou're right the internet company orlike companies who eventually had tohave an internet strategy in the 90slike that was silly more recently it wasprobably more like the the software iseating the world type type I'm not sureright that's definitely true like everycompany is maybe some of your softwarecompany at this point rightum and so yes of course uh and and it ithas to be that way for us to get towhere we want to go I think in some waysright like Bitcoin will not succeed ifit's if it is still to the side of likesome existing system or framework ifit's always outside this if it's notfully integrated and and becoming astandard of sorts whether it's thefinancial standard or even technologicalstandard of how things work thecentralization of social media or mediain general right there's all kinds ofthings where Bitcoin aside from like thefinancial asset and the the price of itobviously like needs to be interwoveninto the world and so yeah you know itdoesn't mean that every company I meanyou can break this down in a couple wayslike yeah maybe every company needs toaccept Bitcoin if they're like ane-commerce company maybe any MediaCompany needs to you know integrate uhyeah or social media companies tointegrate like the decentralizationthings are being worked on like Nosteror dids things like that right so everyindustry has its piece it can pick fromBitcoin if that makes sense and I seethat happening I certainly see thathappening I hope it happens rightand then so when you if if we're goingthat directionagain your clients are going to beBitcoin companies So eventually that'sall companies or most companiessomething like thatI would imagine the the battle fortalent is going to get prettypretty heatedwhen you have clients coming to yousaying they want I don't know like a newwe need accountants and Engineers Etc etcetera and the talent pool is justtappedis there some like are you is or is theprocess of orange killing new candidatespart of it like if say there's no moreaccountants really in your talent poolbut there's plenty of accountants in thenon-orange-filled talent pool are youguys then trying to orange pill some ofthese non-orange build accountants andpull them into the Bitcoin ecosystemlike what does that process look likefor sure I mean again the educationpiece is something Eric's working a loton that I'll have him touch on butbefore that it's umif I think a bit this is all hypothesisat this point right if we think aboutthat Penn State where like Bitcoin soubiquitous every company is a Bitcoincompany right in that worldeverybody's a Bitcoin maybe we have ourown journey into Bitcoin at that placewe have our own kind of uh level of ofuh like how sort of and for Bitcoin weare right I mean that mentally existslike everyone uses the internet todaybut there's some people who yeah don'tnecessarily need to get the newestiPhone or some people who are yeahalways on social media some peoplearen't so like even though it exists andeveryone uses it and knows it there is avariance among the population of likehow in depth you are with that and Ithink that would be the same withBitcoin You could argue too right soit's like yeah everyone will know thatBitcoins is money everyone will knowthat I'm now on this social platformbecause it's better than TwitterFacebook et cetera et cetera rightum and so in that way likeit becomes less about like orangepilling than hiring it's just hiring themost people out there because theyalready have some base levelunderstanding I think of Bitcoin that'sa huge hypothesis right this maybe takesa decade two decades to play out beforebefore this kind of scenario we'retalking about is ultimately happeningum but I think some of that orangepilling will will happen for us overtime by default because Bitcoin itselfis so ubiquitous rightI think we're already seeing that toosome companies we're working with theyget over 500 applications for one jobyeah and they don't want to hire any ofthose applicants so then we have to gointo the market and either find someonethat's already educated on bitcoin andor like you said uh educate them on itso that's yeah it's something that we'reactively working on uh we don't have uhI'm gonna say a foolproof plan and andway to do it we're actively building itout yeah we're hoping over the next fiveten years as Bitcoin becomes moremainstream that the the the candidatesthemselves will have some morebackground knowledgeum as time plays outyeah I mean just speaking as if I put myemployer hat on in the Bitcoin Universelike I haveit's probably my number one preferencefor new hires is that they arebitcoiners it's like yeah if I can tickthat box it's like wellthey're already aligned on values andculture and Mission which is like themost important thing you could ever havein a company right it'sthat's everything almost but then youalso get all these intangibles likebitcoiners in general just seem to befirst of all they're all really smartand they're on different domains I don'tknow what it is about bitcoiners I guessbecause it's hard to understand it justattracts smart people and there's likethe whole you know the ethos of proof ofwork being part of Bitcoin likebitcoiners seem to be very hard workingat a low-time preference hard-workingbuilding for the futurea lot of them are family focused uh alot of them have it seems to be peopleare adopting more like HealthyLifestyles whether this is you knowphysical movement improving your dietEtc so there's this General tilt towardsconstant continuous self-improvementwhich is something I just like Vibe withpersonally so like I love especiallywhen people like that working with youlike what better person could you askfor it's like someone that's alwaystrying to improve themselvesumand so yeah I don't know like itif other employers are of the same likea similar mind as me about thisI I think they're just going to be at apremium like Bitcoin Talent is justgoing to be at a premium people that Ihard bitcoiners are just notagain just checking that one box bringsall these benefits to you as an employerum soyeah but then we could already like ohour value proposition is clear now inthe current state right but I think itbecomes even stronger and an increasedcompetitive environment right like nownow I need external support to help meland the right time like before anothercompany gets them right so it's yeahthat only benefits us I think in thelong run too I think any any big winnerthat'sobviously knowledgeable understandsBitcoin shares those values seems thatshares that same mission to replace themoney with something more soundcompare that with theirtalent to execute in a role man you haveyou're gonna really hiring those type ofpeople are really going to put yourcompany above way above and beyond anyother competitor yeah yeah I agreecompletelyumokayso Bitcoin you know whatever this ideathis network thisum you know monetary system whatever youwant to call it very importantbut there's this other piece we don'ttalk about a lot which is just like themeat spaceBitcoin Network which is us is rightlike we we constitute Bitcoin just asemployers as business ownersentrepreneurs holders AdvocatesEducators you know all these differenthats you wear working for Bitcoineffectively although you're also workingfor yourself and whatever you know thescope of your role or your company isbut there's also this largerum share gold Mission I guess yeah it'slike the sheer which is the beautifulthing about Bitcoin it's like eveneven companies that are competitive inBitcoin right like two companies thatare both trying to sell Bitcoin you knowthey're competing for market sharethey're still aligned on the BitcoinMission so this is very powerfulcohesion I guess among the entireCommunity what how important arebecause my experience my question is howimportant are Live Events to buildingthis meat space Bitcoin Networkyep the condition I want to add in mycondition but this is the qualificationI guess is my experience has beenyou know Bitcoin Twitter is one thingvery competitive and like argumentativeand you know you see the adversarialthinking side of bitcoinersuh just heavily emphasized but then whenyou go to these Bitcoin Live Eventsit just seems like an absolute Love Festlike it's not like that at all it's justpeople like vibing and like having agood time and you know expressinggratitude and talking about Big Ideasjust stimulating conversations allaroundand there's none of that kind ofanimosity you might interpret if youwere just a spectator on bitcoin Twitteryeahum and for me it feels like like that isthat one of the things that not onlygives me more conviction in Bitcoin likewhen you seethat many smart hard-working talentedpeople that tightly bonded over one ideaumjust like how do you beat that groupit's like yeah so how important is it toget people into these Live Events thesemeet spaces to to benefit from thatum cohesion I think that we get in inBitcoin Live Events right yeah I thinkBitcoin is inherently a digitalphenomenon and I think a lot of theconversations that happen nowadays justconsidering where technology is ithappens online and I think a lot ofconversation and emotion gets missedbecause you're not able to portray notonly the message you're trying to getacross but there's also other thingslike your body language you know thatcan that can showif someone's trying to bemalicious towards you or they're tryingto help you so I think humans are socialanimals that's obvious we I mean sinceas far as we date back we've alwaystraveled in packs togetherum built communities it's the same thingwith with the Bitcoin Community tooum so if you're someone that hasn'tattended a meet-up or a conferenceanything in meat space I highlyrecommend it because you'll realize thatthe the feeling about Bitcoin maybe onsomething like a social uh mediaplatform like Bitcoin Twitterthe feeling about Bitcoin is muchdifferent in in-person events and to theextent that we can really build out somemore ideasum work on building companies together Ithink that is it's it's 10 times moreeffective if it's in person and you getthat that social aspect that the feelingthat we're all kind of in this togetherthat you Loops onlineyeah I mean I'll just share a very realanecdote so I yeah my day-to-day lifeworking from home working remotely Ilive here in the suburbs like deep outin the East Bay suburbs of of SanFrancisco about 45 minutes outside thecity it's a beautiful life you know gota nice Yard House my family right butI'm not really working with Bitcoin orstand
