  "text": "After the first month of introducing the \nrewards API and pushing Bitcoin miner as a  new release again, their day 30 retention \nwent up 1200 percent we're talking about  we're talking about a game that had zero \nuse case interest, and you know user base,  and they introduced one single API, and they were \ngiving back tiny portions of their ad revenue,  and now they just recently crossed \nover a million active users right  this is mind-blowing this is a tiny game that \nintroduced Bitcoin rewards, and it explodedHey everyone, welcome to the show. I’m here with \nAndré. André, this has been a long time coming.  I’ve been watching what you guys have been doing \nfrom afar and wow, there’s some serious moves you  guys are making in multiple fronts, which we’re \ngoing to obviously get into on the show here.[00:01:23] Preston Pysh: So \nwelcome to The Investor’s Podcast.[00:01:25] André Neves: Thanks, Preston. It’s \na pleasure to be here. I’ve been a, a big  fan of TIP in general for many years. It’s \nawesome to be here and, and talking to you.[00:01:33] Preston Pysh: We got \na, a short chance to talk when  we were down in Orlando and I was just really \nimpressed with the presentation you had there.[00:01:41] Preston Pysh: So, first, let’s \nstart off with just talk to people about how  you founded your company, what it is, what \nyou were originally trying to accomplish,  and then maybe give us just a short overview \nof maybe how that’s evolved through the years.  Definitely, you know, where business takes you, \nit sometimes isn’t where you originally set off,  but I’m curious how that worked out for you guys.[00:02:04] André Neves: Awesome. So let’s start \nat the beginning, right? Zebedee is the name of  the company. We’re three co-founders, myself, \nAndré Nevis, Simon Cowell, and Christian Moss.  And we like to think of us as the three pillars \nof, of the tripod. So I myself come from the  systems and applications development background. \nI have built software of all kinds in all sizes,  from distributed systems to backend \napplications to front end and mobile apps.[00:02:27] André Neves: Simon Cowell, our CEO \ncomes from the financial services background. He  was prior to Zebedee, he was the head of corporate \nstrategy at Bitstamp, which is the largest Bitcoin  exchange in Europe. And Chris Moss was actually \nthe first person to put Bitcoin into a video game  in the early 2013, right. And so the three of \nus got together and we had very similar ideas  and, and paths. I actually, my path was actually \ncoming from the application development side.  I was leading many software engineering teams \nout in New York for a better part of the decade  and the Bitcoin bug and started learning \nabout Bitcoin. Being originally from Brazil  I learned about bitcoin on the technology \nside, not really on the monetary side. [00:03:07] André Neves: You know, my folks \ncould send me money and I could send them money,  and it settled instantaneously. So that was \nsort of the, the part where it bit for me.  And then right away I realized I have to do \nsomething with this. The entrepreneurial mind,  the driven mind had just said, \nI have to build something here.[00:03:23] André Neves: And that’s what \nI set out to do. But it, it, you know,  it’s a little bit more complex than let’s build \nsomething, right? You need to build a company,  you need to raise money and so on. And, you know, \nas lots of folks in normal jobs, let’s call it,  my job was great, right? I was a director \nof engineering at a digital product studio,  making decent money, growing my career, but it \nwasn’t challenging and it wasn’t transformative.[00:03:45] André Neves: I wanted to have \nimpact. And so I applied and I learned,  and I discovered and I researched and I, \nyou know, started coding things away in  the Bitcoin side of, of things. And that’s where \nI discovered Chaincode Labs. So in early 2016,  with the Lightning Network paper coming \nout, I really got interested in it.[00:04:04] André Neves: Discussed with the \nChaincode Labs folks about it, and was one of the  10 invited to participate in the one and only, I \nbelieve they haven’t run another residency program  yet for the Lightning Network. This was in early \n2018. In that residency program, you probably  would recognize other names like Pierre Rochard, \nlike Jack Mallers, like Alex Bosworth, right?[00:04:24] André Neves: So there was \na lot of, of like Rene Pickhardt who  ended up writing the Lightning Network book. \nSo all of us were in that, that cohort. And  from there I decided that, you know, lightning \nis the future. Bitcoin is definitely the path  here. And I believe it was two weeks later, I \nquit my cushy job and I took the leap, right?[00:04:41] André Neves: It, it was \ntime to take that leap of faith. So I,  I, I went down that rabbit hole at that moment.[00:04:47] Preston Pysh: I \nlove that. Your co-founder  that programmed it into a game. You \nsaid 2012. So this is before any?[00:04:53] André Neves: 2013.[00:04:54] Preston Pysh: 2013. \nThis is before any layer two.  So what, explain to us what that \nwas. What did, what did he do?[00:05:00] André Neves: So he built a, Chris Moss, \nhis handle is @MandelDuck, if you’ve ever heard of  him. He built the very first Bitcoin game in \n2013, and he did it with the game Sara toby.  And really it was the notion of Bitcoin rewards. \nYou know he was working at a, at a digital studio,  similarly in a different company, and wanted the \nclients, wanted him to build a Bitcoin wallet.[00:05:21] André Neves: And in doing \nthat, he got interested in saying, hey,  no one’s done the Bitcoin \ngame. Maybe I should put,  you know, a Bitcoin in a game and reward \nfolks. And it was actually a pretty big hit,  right? The chain was empty compared to now, so \nthe fees were low and it was more or less, okay.  Then things changed by, by rapidly, actually, \nCoinbase got involved and started advertising  his game and giving him money to give out \nhis rewards, and then fees started spiking.[00:05:46] André Neves: And I think it was a \ncouple months after he had to shut it down because  it was no longer feasible. It cost more to send \nthe reward than it was the reward. And then he  said, look, Bitcoin is not it for tiny payments \nyet, right? Yeah. And that was 2013, 2014.[00:06:01] Preston Pysh: So people that \naren’t intimately familiar on the tax,  so with layer two, one of the massive \nadvantages is just immediate settlement  with practically no fees \nthat you can stream money.[00:06:13] Preston Pysh: And so one of the \nthings that you guys have with your API at  Zebedee is people are now creating apps on the \napp store that you can go and download right  now and earn Bitcoin Satoshi’s as you’re \nplaying the game, which is mind blowing.  Yeah. And my immediate thought, when I see this \nmodel as a business person and I’m looking at  them saying, why aren’t these game creators \nincorporating this more into their games?[00:06:40] Preston Pysh: And you \nknow, when I have little kids,  they play the games and there’s all these \nads that are constantly popping up. But I  would think that you could incentivize people \nto play the game more if the user, the end,  the person playing the game is participating \nin the revenue being generated from the ads.[00:06:56] Preston Pysh: And so your company’s \nproviding this turnkey solution for game  designers to incorporate these payments into \nit. Talk to us about the evolution of like  how you guys came up with the idea to do \nthis. When did you start rolling it out?  Just walk us through the whole thing and \nthen, and then I guess at the end of that,  I’m really curious on the game theory, whether \npeople, like, why is it not taking off yet?[00:07:20] Preston Pysh: Do you think \nit’s just we’re really early or,  or some of your ideas on that?[00:07:25] André Neves: Definitely. At the \ncore of Zebedee, we have the Zebedee API,  and that’s really what powers both our \nB2B and our B2C arms and products. What  you’re touching on is our B2B side, \nso aimed to someone that wants to run  a mom and pop shop online and sell, \nyou know, clothes or stickers online.[00:07:42] André Neves: They would go to \nstripe.com and set up an account and then  they can accept dollars. Similarly, anyone, \nwhether you are a store or a operator or  an e-commerce or an app developer or a game \ndeveloper, you could just plug Zebedee APIs,  right? It’s one API. You have a beautiful \ndeveloper dashboard and you’re able to  move money at the speed of the internet and \nyou’ve settled money instantaneously, right?[00:08:04] André Neves: Anywhere in the world.  And so we started the company in 2019 and \nthere were no providers at the time. We were  talking about 2018 was effectively when Lightning \nNetwork, Bitcoin’s payment Network became mainnet,  went into mainnet so everyone could use it in a, \nin a production environment. And by 2019, there  just simply weren’t providers that could allow \nfolks outside of Bitcoin to interact with it.[00:08:28] André Neves: The reality is that \nBitcoin is very complex. If someone tells you  that they understand Bitcoin through and through, \nthat’s a lie. No one actually understands all of  Bitcoin. And then you add upon all of the other \ntechnologies that are adjacent to Bitcoin,  such as the Lightning Network, and \nit becomes even more cumbersome.[00:08:43] André Neves: So it’s not an easy \ntechnology to get started with, and in my view,  being a technologist, a product developer, \na, a product builder, it is inherently,  it’s very hard to onboard billions of folks into \nBitcoin. If it is complicated. It needs to be  simplified and not just for the consumers. \nIt needs to be simplified for developers.[00:09:04] André Neves: If I tell you, if I tell a \ndeveloper that in order to interact with Bitcoin,  they need to understand all of the intricacies \nof UTXO management. That is going to go downhill.[00:09:13] André Neves: That is not going \nto happen. We are not going to get hundreds,  thousands, and millions of developers, right?[00:09:18] André Neves: We need to \nsimplify that and abstract that away.[00:09:21] André Neves: Lightning does a great \njob, whereas Bitcoin is really low level. I  would say layer one, layer two is a little bit \nmore, I would say, closer to app developers too,  to application developers. It’s more pay \nand request, and it’s simpler, right?[00:09:35] André Neves: And yet in 2019, there \nweren’t any providers, right? And so in order to  foster that ecosystem, Zebedee’s first product \nrelease in 2019, in 2020 were the APIs, right?[00:09:45] André Neves: That the first \nversion of the developer dashboard in  the APIs. And at first it was very simple, \nrequest payments, send payments effectively,  pay ins and payouts, for anyone, anywhere. \nAnd then the technology started evolving  and I want to just take a second to, to mention, \nour thesis around the adoption of Bitcoin and  lightning is that it needs to be Bitcoin \ncomes to you when you are ready for Bitcoin.[00:10:10] André Neves: What I mean by that is \nthe censorship resistance aspect of Bitcoin is  important for some folks. Not all the monetary \ndivisibility aspect of Bitcoin of 21 million. And,  and you know, that’s important to some. Not \nall. The interoperability is important to some,  not all. So you need to meet \nthe customer where they’re at.[00:10:28] André Neves: Don’t come to \na game developer selling hard money.[00:10:32] André Neves: That’s not going to sell,  right? That’s not the selling point. The \nselling point is here’s an interoperable  money that you can interact with in instead \nof having 50 integrations for your payouts in  50 countries, you have one integration \nfor payouts in all countries, right?[00:10:44] André Neves: Like \nthat’s the selling point.[00:10:46] André Neves: Increase your \nKPIs, improve your, decrease your churn,  right? So you have to meet the customer where \nthey are. You don’t just yell Bitcoin features  or, or values, right? And so our thesis was \nthe gaming vertical is ripe for it. This is  younger demographic. They are much more in tune \nwith value and point and digital economies.[00:11:07] André Neves: We can talk about \nFortnite, we can talk about World of  Warcraft. Every single one of these MMO RPGs \nis a multi-billion dollar virtual economy,  and there’s trading actively occurring in that \neconomy. Zebedee, the D E E for Zebedee stands  for digital Economy Engines. We actually \nwant to power digital economy engines.[00:11:27] André Neves: We want \nto empower you with solutions,  APIs, SDKs, dashboards, so that you \ncan power economy engines yourself,  whether you’re building an \napplication, a game, or a system.[00:11:39] André Neves: Now, \nback into the gaming side,  I think to your point is advertising \nmodels and how does that works. You  were mentioning that you have kids and \nthey play games and they see lots of ads.[00:11:48] André Neves: What what clicked \nvery quickly was our technology. One,  selling this to game developers in \nearly 2020 was by introducing a reward  mechanism to users based on the re the, \nthe revenue they were getting from ads,  they were able to significantly increase retention \nand significantly decrease churn. So in the video,  in the video gaming industry and mobile gaming \nspecifically, we talk about things like D14  and D30, which are effectively, once the user \nsigns up, are they still here after 14 days?[00:12:19] André Neves: Are they still here after \n30 days? Are they still engaging? And notoriously,  that is really hello, right? It’s effectively \nwhat’s known as churn. So they sign up,  they play for two days, and then they delete \nit, right? So you want the user to remain  here. And what they found is, and I’ll, I’ll \ncite some examples, but what they found is  every single game developer that introduced our \nplatform and our rewards gave APIs, for example,  increased their turn like tenfold, \na hundred fold, a thousand fold.[00:12:44] André Neves: So first and foremost, \nwe have Fumb Games. Fumb Games has a very,  it’s an amazing game. It’s a very \naddictive game called Bitcoin Miner,  and it’s effectively an idle game. It’s \na hyper causal game on your phone. And I  believe it was four years ago, they released \nthat game, but there were no rewards, right?[00:13:01] André Neves: It was just a normal \ngame with advertisements and it flopped. It was  a serious flop. It it, you know, months \nand months of development or nothing.[00:13:09] André Neves: Then Paul West, who’s the \nCEO of Fumb Games, discovered the API and said,  you know, let’s give this a try. After the \nfirst month of introducing the rewards API  and pushing Bitcoin Miner as a new release, \nagain, their day 30 retention went up 1200%.[00:13:24] André Neves: We’re talking about a \ngame that had zero use case interest and you know,  user base. Yeah. And they introduced one \nsingle API and they were giving back tiny  portions of their ad revenue. And now they just \nrecently crossed over a million active users.[00:13:39] André Neves: This is mind blowing. This  is a, a tiny game that introduced \nBitcoin rewards and it exploded.[00:13:45] André Neves: Let’s go through \na bit bigger, right? Square inch,  the 6 billion publicly traded company. They’re a \nvideo game studio. They’re most, most known for  IPs like Final Fantasy. You probably have heard \nof them. They also integrated Zebedee on a handful  of titles and on one of the titles called Ludo \nZenith, which is a game that they published to,  I believe East Asian countries primarily. \nIt’s, it’s a game for that, that region.  It doubled their revenue by simply introducing \nas every API, right? So they effectively,  same thing. They introduced the rewards mechanism, \nand I believe it was 87% increase in their ARPDA,  which is average revenue per daily active user. So \nwe’re saying that one API integration, which takes  three days to depend, you know, two weeks, you can \ndouble your revenue per user in that game, right?[00:14:33] André Neves: So this is very, very \nimpactful and this is where it all started,  right? In 2020, we started seeing that this \nwas the impact. And so to my point earlier,  it’s not about selling Bitcoin, \nit’s not about selling lightning,  it’s not about selling rewards even. \nIt’s about selling better KPIs. So hey,  introduce this payout mechanism, this rewards \nmechanism, and you will double your ARPDA out.[00:14:52] André Neves: You \nwill double your revenue,  you will increase your retention, \nand you’ll reduce your churn.[00:14:56] André Neves: Games become profitable \nafter they add. That’s a big, big statement,  and that’s a true statement that we’ve, we’ve been \nable to hold for all customers that have added it.  And it started with gaming, right? And, and \ngaming has been great and, and it’s something  that continues to grow something that is a little \nbit different than application development.[00:15:14] André Neves: As games take a lot \nlonger of a cycle, games don’t, you know,  build for three months and iterate after \nthey’re released, they build for 6, 12,  18 months and then they release big, big features, \nright? So what you’re about to see is actually  your question was why it hasn’t it picked up \nyet? And my answer is that it definitely has.[00:15:33] André Neves: It’s just that \nit, there are at least 20 games that  I see actively being developed that have \nthis capability. And when I say 20 games,  I don’t mean 20 tiny mobile games. I mean, \nwe have crossed the chasm into desktop games,  into web experiences and mobile, right? \nSo it is coming and it is very much here.[00:15:51] André Neves: It’s just the cycle for \ndevelopment for games. It’s quite a bit longer  than applications and, and platforms. \nRight? So throughout the rest of 2023,  you will see Zebedee and partners of ours \nannouncing big activations and big game launches.  And that should hopefully get you to understand \nthat there’s a lot happening behind the scenes.[00:16:10] André Neves: It’s \njust not at the forefront yet.[00:16:13] Preston Pysh: This is a, \nthis is unbelievable. It’s unbelievable.[00:16:18] André Neves: It’s fascinating when \nwe speak to folks because the reaction at first  if you’re selling Bitcoin is very different \nthan if you’re selling what Bitcoin does for  your business. That’s the impact, right? \nI’m not interested in selling Bitcoin.[00:16:31] André Neves: Bitcoin \nsells itself. I’m interested in  selling the impact that introducing Bitcoin has.[00:16:35] André Neves: And then what \nhappened was everyone started seeing  the impact on the gaming side and we started \ngetting knocks on our doors and said, Hey,  remember there weren’t many providers at the \ntime, and this is early 2020, mid 2020, 2021.[00:16:48] André Neves: You know, there \nwere not many providers. API providers are,  are some folks are very enthusiast enthusiasts,  let’s say. So they build a little API and \nthey put it out, but it’s not well maintained.[00:16:59] André Neves: There’s \nlots of compliance, reg concerns,  right? Regulatory concerns. So what \nwe’ve chosen to do is said, okay,  look, we from the get-go are going \nto be a compliant regulated US-based.[00:17:11] André Neves: Right. So \nwe have, we’re an MSB. We have MTLs,  like we are effectively able to provide this \ncapability legally in a regulated manner. And  so not only does that change the perception, \nbecause it’s inherently that a public company  would need certain capabilities \nand certain expectations like this,  but it also allows us to expand quite \na bit more outside of gaming, right?[00:17:33] André Neves: The reality is that folks  started knocking on the door and \nsaid, Hey, your API is amazing,  but I’m not a gamer or a game developer. Can \nI use it? And at first it was as a business,[00:17:43] André Neves: as as an entrepreneur, \none thing that you can’t do is go too wide. If  you go too wide and your sales funnel is \nnot focused, you’re going to have a very,  very big sales funnel, but not \nmany are going to convert, right?[00:17:55] André Neves: You need to \nbe specialized in solving problems  for individual customers. So at first we \nwere hesitant in expanding in an opening  and saying, look, the use case really is gaming \nand gamers. Then comes, I believe, mid 2021 late  2021. Enough knocks on the door started to \nsound, and we said, okay, maybe it’s time.[00:18:16] André Neves: We started \nworking towards our SaaS offering,  which effectively automates the entirety of our \napplications into a way that anyone can sign up  and get going with an API key. And we’ve got a \nfew launch partners, right? So most prominently,  the very first launch partner of ours was \nFountain. Fountain is the podcasting 2.0.[00:18:35] André Neves: I I believe Oscar has \nbeen a, a guest of yours. And Fountain is backed  entirely by Zebedee infrastructure and they don’t \nworry about payments. They just plug in API and  they process tens of millions of transactions on \na monthly basis. So that was the very first intro  into us expanding and just believe a month \nago we opened it to anything and every one.[00:18:58] André Neves: So you can go \nto zebedee.io, sign up, get an API key,  and start building applications and, and systems,  right? So it’s, it’s scaled quite well and quite \ndrastically over the years. But really it was,  it was on a need basis. Enough folks are \nsaying, hey André, you are actually at  the forefront of running tens of millions \nof transactions per month on Lightning.[00:19:18] André Neves: Like \nthere are not many teams or  companies doing this. I need this, can I use it?[00:19:22] André Neves: Right? And, and we \nsaid, okay, it’s time. We we’re now secure  at a place where we believe it’s time \nto open it. And that’s where streaming  money comes in. And that’s where all \nof these capabilities have popped up.[00:19:33] Preston Pysh: For \npeople that are listening to this,  maybe on the Apple Podcast or whatever.[00:19:36] Preston Pysh: So Fountain that \nAndré was talking about. So our show people  can listen to our show. This conversation \nright now on Fountain. And if they are,  they’ve chosen to stream us, literally stream \nus, sat us money as they’re listening to the  show. So if they listen to 10 seconds of \nit, they’re just streaming whatever the  rate is that we have set there, they’re \nstreaming that for those 10 seconds.[00:19:59] Preston Pysh: If \nthey listen to the whole show,  they’re streaming throughout that entire period \nof time. And the model is to eventually do away  with ads on a show so that people can just \npay as they listen. I wanted to just, just  so people can understand like how like mind \nblowing this is, and the reason you can’t do  this with traditional finances because you \ncan’t stream somebody a 30th of a penny.[00:20:21] Preston Pysh: Right. Or listening \nfor two seconds or whatever it might be.  So that’s why this is so revolutionary when \nI’m, I’m trying to look at it from the gamer,  like if I was a game developer and just kind \nof walking through the entire process and  so people can kind of understand the \nservice that you’re providing, André.[00:20:39] Preston Pysh: So let’s say I created \na game. I’m running ads every two minutes during  that game in order to generate some type of \nrevenue. So the, the person who’s playing the  game say it’s some 13 year old kid, he downloads \nthis game on his iPad. And are they then saying,  this is my Bitcoin wallet, where I would like to \nreceive, to participate in the, in the ad revenue?[00:21:03] Preston Pysh: Do they just \ngive their lightning address of like  where they can receive Bitcoin as they’re \nplaying the game? And then talk us through  how the, the game developer is basically \nloading the Bitcoin to stream it to that  person who’s playing the game. Walk us \nthrough some of that, that architecture.[00:21:20] André Neves: Definitely I’ll do \nthe consumer side first, since it’s more  attuned to the, to the audience. You download \na game and you start playing right there. You  don’t need to enter anything and nothing’s, \nusually you download a game and you pick up  gems or coins or stones, right? And they just \nput plus one right in your little counter.[00:21:38] André Neves: Usually in, it’s entirely \nup to the game developer how they, I actually  implement Zebedee and the rewards into the actual \nfabric of the game. So some developers have it  where as you complete tasks or beat the big boss \nor you know, you complete like a big stage of  the game, you get a reward. And in that reward, \nmaybe some gems, but you get five SATs or 20 SATs.[00:22:00] André Neves: And so it’s part of the \ngame. Some games like a like a Tetris style game,  for example coin Majong is, is \none that’s powered by us. And,  you know, if you get five in a row, then \nyou get a reward. And it’s, it’s bitcoin.  And they just add a counter to it. So \nyou get 10 stats, 20 stats, 50 stats.  When you’re ready to cash out or get your \nrewards, you click to withdraw, and then you lean  on the fact that Bitcoin and Lightning are open \nnetworks and you just enter a lightning address.[00:22:27] André Neves: It could \nbe your Zebedee Lightning address,  it could be any lightning address,  right? So the game developer is inherently \ninteroperable. With every wallet out there,  they don’t need to sit only with Zebedee. So \nthey don’t even force their users to use Zebedee.[00:22:41] André Neves: Some \nof them recommend Zebedee,  right? Because they want that, \nyou know, easy UX for customers.[00:22:47] André Neves: They want the \ncontinuity for the user experience,  but it is very much not a requirement. And \nusers have a lightning address and then they  click withdraw or, or redeem, right? And \nthey receive their stats and they go on  about their day. So on the developer side on \nthe consumer side, it’s very straightforward.[00:23:03] André Neves: It’s, it’s \nactually not, it’s an additive experience,  right? You can still play most of the games \nwithout actually ever interacting with the  Bitcoin. It’s just that now your rewards and \nyour points have value and you can take them out.[00:23:16] André Neves: And similar to what you’re \nsaying, it’s inherently impossible to do in fiat  terms because have you ever bought anything less \nthan a dollar online with a credit card? Yeah,  that’s not a thing. Right? And I think \nthe cheapest thing is actually the apps  in the app store on I iPhones, because \nit’s like 99 cents or, or 69 cents,  that’s the lowest threshold. It hits your bank \naccount and it’s a dollar 30, okay? It is not  99 90 9 cents. And so it is infeasible \nimpossible to send two stats, five stats.[00:23:44] André Neves: This is, \nyou know, hundreds of ascent,  hundreds of fractions of ascent. Then on \nthe developer side, the way this works on-[00:23:51] Preston Pysh: André real fast and, \nand not to mention, so everything you just  said plus. You can be anywhere in the world. \nIt does not matter where your jurisdiction,  you could be VPNing in via the game to whatever, \na domain or locale in the world that you want.[00:24:06] Preston Pysh: Yes. And these things are  still controllable. Where like \nif you’re dealing with dollars,  maybe you can only do that in the US or you can \nonly do it over in the if you’re dealing with-[00:24:15] André Neves: if you’re in, if \nyou’re in a game developer in Brazil and  you integrate rewards with Brazilian eyes, \ngreat. You have a 220 million addressable  user base of potentially Brazilians who \nhave access to Brazilian Piat rails.[00:24:27] André Neves: But if you \nintroduce Bitcoin, how many people  in the world are there? Seven plus billion. \nSo like that is now your addressable market.  What’s interesting is the impact of these \nmicrotransactions, right? So these are micro,  micro, nano transactions even. But the \nimpact that they have is actually macro.  We’ve seen gamers in Brazil pay rent, pay \ngroceries, pay bills by playing games.[00:24:49] André Neves: It’s not, it’s \nnot a life-changing money necessarily,  right? I don’t want to suggest that people should \nwork on this, but it is something that makes a  very large impact. And when you combine that with \ndepreciating, and this is your bread and butter,  depreciating fiat economies, and how their \ncurrencies are being debased, you look at  Brazilian eyes, Brazil has gone through six \ndifferent monies over the past 60 plus years.[00:25:12] André Neves: So they are very \nkeen on getting the next money. It’s fine,  you know, this is it. And it is more, you know, \nit’s better, it’s, it’s easier to use online.  So now on the developer side, again, \nvery simple. Go to zebedee.Io, sign up.  You create a game in a project, in the, in the \ndashboard, and you can top it up with Bitcoin.[00:25:32] André Neves: So in the dashboard \nyou could even deposit Bitcoin, you could,  you know, do the whole flow. You could also buy \nBitcoin in the dashboard, so you can top it up  with your credit card. And so as a developer, you \nhave all of the tools at your disposal. And then  you use one of our SDKs, one of our APIs. \nSo we have a Rust sdk, we have a node sdk,  we have a Unity sdk. So we come to where you \nare in your environment. So if you’re building  a gaming in Unity, we’re there. You’re building \na server side application in no js, we’re there  with you. And it’s as simple as Zebedee dot \nsend payment, Zebedee get lightning address,  right? It’s very readable. It’s \nvery simple. Anyone can get started.[00:26:12] André Neves: And once you’ve \nloaded some Bitcoin in your project wallet,  you can start dishing it out to any users in \nthe world, right? So it’s, it’s really that  simple. And it’s free, I forgot to say that’s \nimportant. It’s entirely free. You can sign up  and get going. If you’re building an application \nthat is going to scale, we will grow with you.[00:26:29] André Neves: So there, we have a \ntiered system. We have a pro tier starting  at 50 bucks a month. We have a startup \ntier starting at 500 bucks a month. And  if you’re building larger enterprises, \nright, we have enterprise customers,  we are able to create custom tiers for you. But \nit is free for any hobby developer to get started,  and you’re able to create projects, get \nAPI keys, and start sending money globally.[00:26:50] André Neves: So \nit’s, it’s really that simple.[00:26:53] Preston Pysh: In the service \nthat you guys are providing in the backend,  that they might not, you know, a listener \nthat’s not intimately familiar with Lightning,  and correct me if I’m wrong, but you guys \nare doing all the channel management inside  of Lightning. So what, is there any other \nthings beyond the channel management that  I’m just kind of like waving my hands and \nlike, this is what you guys are doing.[00:27:10] Preston Pysh: Like tell the \naudience what what it is you guys are,  are providing in the background as a \nservice to them that makes it all turnkey.[00:27:18] André Neves: It’s actually a \nfascinating thing because we abstract so  much out of it that it becomes \nso simple that I, I love it,  right? I use our APIs to build tools and \napplications and things, and it sort of blows  my mind that two years ago or a year ago, \nthis was a completely different landscape.[00:27:35] André Neves: In lightning, \nJust to very briefly go over in lightning,  this is a on always online liquidity network, \nright? So it requires constant management.[00:27:44] André Neves: We don’t run one node. \nWe run tens of nodes. We don’t deploy liquidity  manually in opening channels here and there. We \nhave automated systems to this. We need to have  high availability servers. So if a server crashes, \nwe need another one to spin up. We need an entire  automation around backups and channel management, \ndata storage, right? All of this is handled right?  We’ve spent countless resource hours, engineering \nhours automating all of these processes. So it’s  amazing to me that when folks start saying, oh, \nit’s so simple, I say, yes, it’s, it’s so simple.  No it, it was not simple. Okay? Like it used to \ntake hundreds of lines of code to send a payment,  and I guess now it’s, you know, Zebedee send \npayment, right? Yeah. So it’s a lot under the  hood and we have a very robust infrastructure, \nCSOPs and security teams that manage all of this.  So you don’t worry about liquidity concerns, \nyou don’t worry about your payment failing.[00:28:37] André Neves: We have a \n97 plus percent plus payment success  rate in the network. It’s really only if \nyou’re paying to, you know, the really,  really far edge nodes that we would run \ninto any issues. So there’s a lot that  happens behind the scenes that’s, \nthat’s automated for the customers.[00:28:52] Preston Pysh: As a person \nthat’s set up my own node and opened  like a hundred channels and then tried to \nmanage the liquidity of these channels.[00:29:00] Preston Pysh: I can tell \nyou from my own personal experience  that it’s not something that you’re just \ngoing to do and, and it’s easy. Like it,  especially for somebody that’s not \ntechnically competent like myself.[00:29:12] André Neves: Really, really depends \non the use case. Yeah, yeah. Absolutely.[00:29:15] André Neves: I, if it’s a things to toy \naround, if it’s to learn, if it’s to get engaged.[00:29:19] André Neves: Yeah, \nabsolutely. If you’re running a  business, you’re now it’s, it’s \na to, hey, I want to run a mom  and pop shop to sell t-shirts. Let me \njust go and become a payment gateway.[00:29:29] André Neves: That, that’s a really \nbig overhead. It depends on the use case. I  run nodes myself, but to your point, I’m very \ntechnical, right. And, and I’m able to do that.[00:29:38] André Neves: Most people are, so \nI, I think it’s important to have options.[00:29:42] Preston Pysh: If there ever \nwanted to be a comedy for technical people,  it would’ve just been a camera over \nmy shoulder just watching my actions  on the computer. People would really get, \nit would be a top-notch comedy for folks.  Hey, so there’s, there is a huge development \nin social media happening right now.[00:29:59] Preston Pysh: André, with Nostr, I had \nWill Casarin on probably back at the beginning of  the year talking about what he’s doing with dmo \nand this is a huge breakthrough. So from your  vantage point, tell people why you think Nostr is \na really big deal, how it potentially compliments  Bitcoin and how you guys are treating \nthis as a company kind of moving forward.[00:30:27] André Neves: Yeah, absolutely. I think \nit may make sense to go a little bit back into the  history of Nostr and explaining a, a bit of \nhow it all came about, seeing that we were,  I have been a privileged participant in this \nwhole journey. So for context Zebedee is  our enterprise solution software company, \nright? We have both B2C and B2B products.[00:30:49] André Neves: And at our core, we have \nthis API platform, but primarily the API platform  does, you know, a, a set full of things, but it \nconsumes open networks, it consumes Bitcoin and  it consumes Lightning Network and it consumes open \nsource a software, right? So as a technologist, as  a product builder, as a developer, it was always \nreally important for me and for my teams that we  support open source, we support open development, \nwe support innovation. Early on in the company,  we started with what was internally known as ZBD \nlabs eventually became ZBDOSS for open source.  But then we said, look, this is growing too \nmuch. It’s now time for us to make this into an  organization. Let’s deploy resources, both capital \nand human resources to them, to this organization.[00:31:32] André Neves: And so we \ncreated from ZBD, we created NBD,  right? NBD stands for no big deal. \nIt’s our open source arm. And so,  and whereas ZBD has products that are revenue \ngenerating and then are searching for customers,  NBD just puts out code. And the announcement, \nI said NBD has no KPIs. NBD has no deadlines.[00:31:53] André Neves: We just put out \nsovereign software to the world, right? Our  lead engineer and our lead open source developer \nis Fiatjaf. Fiatjaf, for those who don’t know,  is a very prolific developer in the Bitcoin \nlightning ecosystem. And he has been with us  for well over three years now. And one thing \nthat I’ve, I’ve been able to do is identify,  I pride myself in doing, I guess, is \nidentify individuals who show a lot of  drive, ambition and, and ability to deliver on \nreally challenging times, innovative and very,  I guess challenging really is the word right \nto, you know, you’re as a developer usually  you run into a problem, you Google it, or \nnowadays I guess you ChatGPT it, right?[00:32:35] André Neves: Or stack flow. You \nknow, with Lightning and with things like Nostr,  there was no one that had gone through that \nbefore. So you need to be at the forefront  and, and ready to get your hands dirty. \nI pride myself in, in finding those folks  and really enabling them. And Fiatjaf was one \nof them, and so I brought him onto Zebedee.[00:32:51] André Neves: Early on he \nworked on a lot of things in the,  in the Zebedee ecosystem you know, court to \nZebedee. But very early on I said, Hey man,  you need to be doing open source. And from that, I \nthink lots of things like l n anywhere else, like  lightning address came around. These are things \nthat we have built and, and integrated with.[00:33:09] André Neves: And he said, Hey, I \nwant to try and solve this problem. And we said,  great. Go ahead. I believe in you. Let’s do \nit. So Fiatjaf lo and behold goes and spends  a weekend and comes out and says, here’s a \nlittle thing that I’ve been trying to build.  As with any standard standards \nonline are just standards.[00:33:27] André Neves: They’re nothing. \nIt’s just, here’s a set of instructions.  Every standard needs a network effect. \nYou need participants to, to participate.[00:33:34] André Neves: And with \nNostr being released in late 2020,  it actually just saw organic growth for \na good two years. It didn’t really see,  it was organic. Folks were getting \ninvolved, interested, and because  of the relationship with Bitcoin, there were \na lot of Bitcoin developers into that space.[00:33:50] André Neves: So it was very, very easy \nto see the combination of both. It wasn’t until  December of 2022 that Jack Dorsey got a whiff, \nNostr and then reached out to Fiatjaf and said,  Hey, I want to donate money to you. Fiatjaf \nreached out to me. I remember him sending  me a screenshot of the message from Jack on \nTwitter, and he is like, is this fake right?[00:34:11] André Neves: And I, and I’m like, I, I \ndon’t know. It looks real. So that’s where it sort  of, you know, began. And then December, 2022 from \ntill now, I think things have just skyrocketed  both on the terms of, of funding developers \nfor the space, but also just applications,[00:34:27] André Neves: clients, relays. Every \nsingle sort of software has been developed around  Nostr now, and, you know, I, I believe there \nare now over hundreds of thousands of users  using the platform at scale. Nostr is very \ndifferent because it is, I guess, touching on  some of the things that I’ve, I’ve done in the \npast in terms of presentations, I’ve been able  to dumb down these. I don’t love the term dumb \nit down, but I don’t, you know, you’ve dumb it  down the terms and, and, and the architectural \ndetails in a way that folks can understand.[00:35:00] André Neves: I used the, the \nsense of emailing to really get the idea  across. Okay, so Preston probably use Gmail, \nI may use Outlook, my cousins could use Yahoo.[00:35:10] André Neves: And you know,  you could use any email out there. \nAnd it’s a different email provider.[00:35:14] André Neves: It’s a different \nemail client, but they all subscribe  to the same protocol, the same simple \nmail transfer protocol. And that’s why  messages can be exchanged regardless of where \nyou are, regardless of server or client you’re  using. In social media environments and \ncommunication environments nowadays,  you need a Twitter account to talk to your \nTwitter friends. You need a Facebook account,  to use Facebook, and you need a TikTok, and then \nSnapchat and Instagram, and you keep going, right?[00:35:37] André Neves: There’s what, 50 of \nthem at least. And on as an aside, you now have  password manager problems because you need to, you \nknow, you can’t repeat passwords. It’s insecure  and so forth. So let’s imagine a world where my \naccounts on Twitter could log me into Facebook.[00:35:53] André Neves: My accounts \non Twitter could post on TikTok,  right? And so if these applications were \nclients of a protocol, just like emails work,  you would see a plethora of activity \nbecause now it’s all interoperable,  right? That’s why email is so prevalent. As \na developer, emails are extremely outdated.  The code that goes into emails display, \nthe rendering of emails is from 1995.[00:36:19] André Neves: Okay. It’s, it’s very \noutdated, but it’s abundant because it is the  single interoperable way to communicate with \neveryone in the world. And it’s still here  and it’s 2023. So Naster could disrupt \nthat. On the social media side, with[00:36:33] André Neves: Nostr, \nyou create a, into Bitcoin,  you have a public and a private key. Right.[00:36:37] André Neves: And \nyou’re able, that’s your identity,  and you’re able to take that and log in on any \nclient, on any experience. So I could log to a  Twitter esque experience and I could take my \nfollowers and my lists and my follow count,  and I could go over to my other Instagram \nlike experience with the same followers.[00:36:56] André Neves: With the same individuals. \nRight. So it’s, it’s really the interoperability  that’s really impactful. And because of \nthe way the architecture of Naster works,  there’s two parts that are really interesting \nto me. One is it’s extremely simple. I  was talking about standards and how \nBitcoin is very complicated, right?[00:37:13] André Neves: It’s complicated \nfor many reasons, but it is complicated.  And so it’s important that we, we bring the \ndeveloper closer to that ecosystem so they  can build applications. Nostr, on the other \nhand, is extremely simple. It’s one event,  right? It’s one single object that defines \nevents. These are the names of posts, right?[00:37:32] André Neves: So if you’re making a post \non Nostr, that’s an event. If you’re updating your  profile image, that’s an event, right? And so it’s \nextremely simple for developers to get started,  which meant that hundreds of developers have \nalready gotten involved and have already been  building. So that’s one piece. The other \npiece is around Nasser’s, big censorship  resistance capability, which is very akin to \nBitcoin’s values, which is the notion that,  you know, if Twitter doesn’t, like what I’m \nsaying, Twitter can just ban my account.[00:38:01] André Neves: On nostr, \nthe way it works is if X, Y,  Z client doesn’t like what I’m saying, or if X, Y,  Z server or relay doesn’t like what I’m saying, \nI can take my keys and I can go to another one.[00:38:11] André Neves: And if \nthey don’t like what I’m saying,  I can go to yet another one. Right. \nAnd I can host my own if I want to.  And everyone could still read my messages \nand everyone could still interact with me.[00:38:20] André Neves: So the \noptionality ache into Bitcoin,  you can hold your Bitcoin, you can \nuse hundreds of different wallets,  right? With naster you could self-host \nyour Nostr relay and clients.[00:38:31] Preston Pysh: I’ve got a question \nfor you on this. So my, when you were going  through it, and I love the analogy you’re using \nbetween email and then on the social layer,  but I was immediately thinking, \nwell, why can’t we just do what  we’re doing on Nostr with the email \nprotocol, with the SMTP protocol?[00:38:48] André Neves: And I think it’s \ngetting, I, I, correct me if I’m wrong,  but it seems like a lot of the servers that \nare providing theSMTP protocol to users,  end users is. Captured, or it’s centralized, \nwhich doesn’t give a person this type of  flexibility of being quote unquote canceled. \nSo is that what it is that makes it different?[00:39:12] André Neves: Let me, let me explain \na little bit more. I guess with emails, you  can self host your email, right? You can run an \nemail server. It is very cumbersome and complex,  right? It is not something that anyone just \ndoes. It’s not, you know, click and get started.  So that’s one piece. The other piece \nis with something as ossified asSMTP,  if you were to introduce a new version of SMTP \nor a new addition to the protocol or a new thing.[00:39:39] André Neves: You now need every \nmajor institution, every major email provider,  we’re talking about Google, we’re talking \nabout Yahoo. You need to convince those  folks to change the protocol and now \nadopt this new, because it, it doesn’t,  again, standards are just instructions. I \ncould write a new instruction, but if no  one else in the email protocol is following the \ninstruction, then it, it never came to fruition.[00:40:03] André Neves: Right? So it’s a \nmuch higher barrier to entry. When we say,  let’s evolve a protocol that is ossified, then \nlet’s create something new that has different  features and different capabilities. Could we \nevolveSMTP? Theoretically, yes. We could take SMTP  and evolve it. I don’t think it would be a perfect \nfit, but you could always build upon standards.[00:40:24] André Neves: It’s just a \nmuch higher lift. We’re talking about,  you know, the entirety of the internet. From \napplication systems, you know, backends,  they’re all aware of emails in this way to \nintroduce something new. That’s a very big change.  And so that’s why we wouldn’t want to \npursue that angle. Does that make sense?[00:40:41] Preston Pysh: Yeah, it does. And what’s \ninteresting, so like I run a umbrella. Yeah. And  they rolled out, Hey, run your own nore relay on \nUmbr for your personal account so that you could  never be canceled. And it was so turnkey. I just, \nI clicked a couple buttons and I was like, wow,  this is some serious, like freedom tech as far as \nlike keeping your, your, your messages as you’re  looking at this new protocol and what appears to \nbe something that’s just growing like wildfire  globally right now, how do you see that from a \nZebedee standpoint of a business opportunity?[00:41:16] Preston Pysh: Or do you \nsee this as a business opportunity  using Bitcoin with Nostr and, and whatnot?[00:41:22] André Neves: Yeah, so going \nback to the NBD, our open source arm,  the reality is that when open networks are \nthriving and are growing, things like Bitcoin,  things like lightning network, we are \nat a place where they can compound.[00:41:35] André Neves: So if we’re able \nto get Bitcoin and lightning to work in  a Nostra environment, we have two open \nnetworks, decentralized networks that can  grow organically and in their own merits, but \nthey can enable capabilities that couldn’t have  been possible before. A thing that, that’s \nvery key to Bitcoin is everyone for like,  there has been, what, 14 years now, that \nmillions of people now have Bitcoin addresses.[00:42:01] André Neves: They have lightning \nwallets, they have Bitcoin wallets, but it’s  not easy to send to each other, right? Because \nI need to say, Hey Preston, I need to understand  where’s your wallet? Can you send me a QR code \nof some kind so that I can find you? Right?[00:42:14] André Neves: Nostr provides a \ndiscoverability layer for bitcoin enabled  identities. So you are an identity, a digital \nnomad, right? You are a person on the internet,  you have a wallet, but you haven’t been \nable to advertise to tell people that  this is my wallet. Now there’s a medium \nfor it. So where we see that is, again,  Zebedee consumes open networks. So we \nconsume Bitcoin, we consume lightning.[00:42:39] André Neves: We are now consuming \nNostr. The way we see it is gaming and online  experiences are inherent and social experience \nare inherently social, right? You need people  to interact. It’s not just you in a game or you \nand a robot. You want you and other players, you  want you and other friends. You want you and your \nmates playing something or learning something.[00:42:58] André Neves: So at the \nZebedee side on the consumer business,  we have the ZBD app. That’s where folks \nlearn about new games. That’s where they  get involved with, you know, podcasting \nsystems. That’s where they, you know,  discovered monetized experiences online. And it’s \na full-blown Bitcoin lightning wallet in there.[00:43:15] André Neves: It was inherently to us \nthat we needed to bring a social aspect to this  and we were always going to build it. And then \nin, you know, as soon as December last year,  things exploded, right? And Nostr kind of \ngrew. It’s awesome that we’re now able to  be talking to you about this because we have \njust released the new version of the ZBD app.[00:43:34] André Neves: The ZBD app now has \na massive social part of it. It’s a very big  ZBD app upgrade. We are rolling out the alpha \naccess right now, so go to zbd.gg and sign up  for the wait list. We are letting people in in the \nthousands every week. There’s a lot of interest.[00:43:51] André Neves: And what this \nmeans is that any developer or any user  or any gamer or any person out there can \nsign up to the ZBD app and get started.[00:44:00] André Neves: With both Bitcoin \nand Nostr, you get a social identity that  is monetized. And for us, the angle here is to \ndisrupt monetization schemes that exist nowadays.[00:44:12] André Neves: If you look into the \nway the current monetization works in digital  content creation scheme, right, revenue sharing \nand, and brand deals is really how it works.[00:44:21] André Neves: If you’re a, you \nknow, a hundred thousand plus influencer  on Instagram or on Facebook, or on Snapchat \nor on TikTok, so you’re able to monetize that  through brand partnerships or, or advertisements \nor so on. But not only do they take a hefty cut,  right? Only fans takes 20%. Patreon takes 15%. \nTwitter and, and some stock take 10%, right?[00:44:43] André Neves: So the content \ncreator economy online is not ripe for it,  and Nasser and Bitcoin are here to solve that \nproblem with Nostr and Bitcoin. In the ZBD app,  you maintain 99% of your earnings. You are able to \nput out content that is consumed by the entirety  of the world, regardless of where they are \nin the world, which jurisdiction they are,  which fiat money they use, they’re able to \nget Bitcoin and they’re able to zap you.[00:45:07] André Neves: They zap 2 cents \nor $2,000, right? It’s really up to you how  that works. And so by disrupting this, \nthis content and monetization online,  I believe this is going to foster lots of \ninnovation, lots of creativity, lots of new  things. Keep 99% of your value. That’s a big deal. \nThe second one is encrypted dms with payments.[00:45:29] André Neves: This is something that’s \nnot been here, it’s 2023. We have Bitcoin.[00:45:33] André Neves: We should \nbe able to send messages around the  world. We should be able to send money \naround the world with the new ZBD app.[00:45:39] André Neves: You can do \nthat. You can sign up and you can  send messages a to how you do with Twitter, \ndms ache to how you do you with Instagram.[00:45:45] André Neves: But money is \npart of the fabric of your experience  and specifically to us. The ZBD app has \nlots of ways for you to earn Bitcoin. A  big hurdle for folks is to buy Bitcoin. To get \nBitcoin right, and you have to get an exchange  account and you have to buy Bitcoin and you \nget a a debit card. That’s very cumbersome.[00:46:03] André Neves: For us, Bitcoin needs to \nbe as simple. It needs to be cool, it needs to  be friendly. So you download zBD, you’re able to \ndownload games or apps or engage in experiences  where you earn Bitcoin. And once you earn that \nBitcoin, you’re then able to interact with others  in the social environment, right? So you can \nzap each other, you can like each other’s posts.[00:46:20] André Neves: Once you’ve done that,  you’ve arrived at an ecosystem of value-driven \nengagement instead of just likes and retweets,  which feed an algorithm, right? We want \nvalued engagement with folks. We don’t want  just random numbers being thrown around. So \nthe ZBD app is that entry point for everyone,  and you can get started today at ZBD \ngg and signing up for the wait list.[00:46:44] Preston Pysh: Love it. Love it. \nSo André I’m prepping for the thing I for  this interview. I saw you were asked to be \na speaker at MIT, having seen some of the  things that you’ve done in the space. You’re \na very successful entrepreneur and builder,  like a true builder in this space. We have a lot \nof people, young people that listen to the show.[00:47:05] Preston Pysh: That might want to become \nan entrepreneur. What type of entrepreneurial  guidance or advice do you have for people to just \nbasically be an, a player like yourself, to be  out there and just crushing it and making moves? \nLike, what’s, what’s your advice to these people?[00:47:21] André Neves: I actually gave- so my \ntalks at MIT are great. I highly recommend I  discuss the lightning address and the other \none I discuss Nostr, very highly recommend  those two talks. I also gave a, a recent talk \nat the Wolf NYC cohort founders. These are for  those that don’t know, these are lightning and \nBitcoin founders going through incubator process.[00:47:41] André Neves: And in \nthat talk, I, I touched on this,  right? Things that as a founder \nyou should be aware of and so on.[00:47:46] André Neves: I think three themes come \nup to mind and I’ll, I’ll quickly go through them.  The first one being it’s a massive leap. I \ntalked about it in the beginning. I had a,  I had a great job, right? And, and it was great.[00:47:57] André Neves: I love my job, loved \nthe people I work with. When it bites. You know  that it bites and you know that you need it. \nIt, there’s an itch that you have to scratch.  You will not be able to scratch that itch until \nyou take that leap. Okay? If that’s your feeling,  you are the entrepreneur type and \nyou want to scratch that itch,  and you will have to take that leap eventually.[00:48:15] André Neves: It’s scary and \nit may not seem like the right move,  but it is. It is that moment. And on the, once you \ntake that leap, you feel that relief. You don’t  even know if it’s going to pan out. But I did what \nI wanted to do. I challenged myself, of course,  run through your cases, run through your, \nyour best case scenario, worst case scenario.[00:48:32] André Neves: I’m not saying just, \njust go for it, but follow your gut, follow  your intuition, and, and it is always a leap. If \nit doesn’t feel like a leap. It’s probably not a  big deal enough. So that’s one, one piece that \nI mentioned. The second piece is, it’s so much  more work than you can imagine. You’re going to \ndo so many things that you had never expected.[00:48:51] André Neves: I’m a CTO, but I’m \narguably the CPO of the company and I’m arguably,  you know, involved in every facet of the company. \nFrom the marketing to strategy, to I do customer  support. I have a team of 73 people in the \ncompany remotely distributed, and I still do  customer support, Preston. And that’s why it’s \nimportant everyone seasons that in the company.[00:49:09] André Neves: Like we’re all \nworking towards the same mission. So you  will do things like my VP of engineering \nwas our video recorder in our vR chat  room. You see what I mean? Like that \nis not a piece of engineering role,  but everyone is willing to do that. So \nas a startup builder, you’re going to  put your big boy pants on or your big girl \npants on and it’s going to be a long ride.[00:49:30] André Neves: And, and you’re \ngoing to do many things you do not expect.  And then last but not least, I think it’s really \nimportant that if you are the entrepreneur type,  like myself and the builder type, you need to \nunderstand that work is life and life is work,  right? So you need to get that boundaries.[00:49:47] André Neves: I have \nvery few boundaries. Work is life,  and life has worked for me, \nand maybe that’s why it works,  but it affects people. That affects your \nrelationships. It affects, you know,  your business to take that into account. It’s not \na light thing, everyone says that, but it’s, it[00:49:59] André Neves: shouldn’t be taken \nas a light thing. It’s, you will work, right?[00:50:02] André Neves: It’s going to be many, \nmany hours. And so take that into account, but  nothing will ever scratch that itch until you go \nand, and build the thing that you want to build.  So I, I highly recommend and it’s amazing to be at \na position like I am with a team, with a company,  with many products. It’s a dream come true and \nI really highly recommend everyone to attend it.[00:50:22] Preston Pysh: Any tips? So those are \namazing. Any, any tips for people on focusing on  the right thing? Because one thing I see that’s \nreally common with entrepreneurs are people  that are trying to become an entrepreneur \nis they’ve got these ideas and, you know,  having built something historically, you sometimes \nyou can just look at it and be like, wow.[00:50:40] Preston Pysh: That’s a huge hurdle, and \nyou might be biting off too much. You talked about  a little bit earlier in the conversation with \nlike being too broad. When you come into market,  what tips do you have for people to help \nfocus in on where they should be focusing  their energy and making sure that they’re not \nbiting off too much or that they’re too narrow?[00:50:58] Preston Pysh: And it’s not even \nreally a business, it’s just more of like a,  a small niche idea. How do you, how do, \nwhat advice do you have on that front?[00:51:05] André Neves: So focus is really \nimportant, and I’m glad you touched on this. It’s  something that as a builder, you feel like you can \njust, oh, I, I can do it. You know, don’t worry.[00:51:12] André Neves: I’m going to \nhandle this. And, and as a, as a builder,  like a developer, you really feel that you can \ndo that. Because you feel like you can solve  all your problems with engineering \nsolutions, and that’s not the case.  You really need to focus on what you can build. \nI, I voiced similar feedback to those at the, at  the Wolf NYC cohort, which was, look, you need \nto pick where you are going to be the best. So  if you’re building a gaming platform that \nallows for money to flow in that platform,[00:51:38] André Neves: Are you going to be \nthe best money provider or are you going to  be the best gaming platform? So be the \nbest gaming platform and plug in a money  provider if you’re going to be an exchange \nof, of some kind. Okay, I need licenses.[00:51:51] André Neves: Great. So that’s going \nto be your focus. Don’t do that. And mining and  this and that, right? Like you need to find your \nmoat, your big moat. And once you have that moat,  and once you have that focus and that level of \nnotoriety and trustworthiness in that vertical,  okay, find another moat. You have, you’ve \nexcelled in this vertical move on. If you  attempt to bite too many of these, these, you \nknow, whatever analogy we want to create here.[00:52:16] André Neves: If you attempt to go \nthrough too many of these, similar to the sales  cycle, right? If it’s too broad, you will fail. \nYou will not find that one moat and you will be  a generalist, good company in many fronts, but \nno one will come to you because you are the best.[00:52:31] André Neves: And people come to the \nbest, they don’t come to the third best or the  fifth best, or the generalist. They come \nfor the best. So if I want payments online,  I go to stripe.com because that’s the best \nright now. If I want lightning payments,  I go to Zebedee because that’s the best, right?[00:52:44] André Neves: So you need to find \nwhat your mode is and not go too broad.[00:52:48] André Neves: And otherwise \nyou’re going to, you’re not going to meet  those numbers. Focus where you’re at and then \nevolve. So what I recommend to folks that are  very hardcore Bitcoiners, that want to do \ntheir own payment gateway capabilities is,  Don’t start from that from scratch. Use \nan API provider so that you can build  the best user experience for your app, \nfor your platform, for your user base.[00:53:10] André Neves: And then when \nyou’re ready and you have that, okay,  I want to self-host and do all the \npayment capability ourselves. Great.  Disconnect that API and do it yourself \nbecause you’ve now excelled at your moat.[00:53:20] André Neves: So definitely \nfocusing, and I think one way to just  describe that is for our launch show, the \nZBD app, instead of building all of those  capabilities that we want inside of the app, \nthere are things that we’re doing with Launch  partners. So Fountain is a launch partner \nof ours. Wave Lake is a launch partner of  ours. So if you post Wave Lake links of music \nlinks into the ZBD app in your social feed,  Zebedee is able to pick that up. And once you \nzap someone, it automatically splits between  the artist and the poster of that post, right? \nWe are not the ones doing the music piece here.[00:53:55] André Neves: We are interacting with \nan open standard of, of music that allows us to  interact. So we’re not trying to become the music \nmoat. That’s not our moat. Our moat is social and  payments, right? So let’s interact. And so they \nare, wave Lake is focused on music, fountain is  focused on podcasting. Let’s leverage those and \nthat’s what we’ve done for the launch partners.[00:54:13] André Neves: Find good \npartners as you continue growing and  then eventually you could build moat \nyour of your own in that industry.[00:54:20] Preston Pysh: It feels like \nwe’re just so early in where this is  potentially going. So like my last question \nfor you, André, is just five years from now,  what does this look like 10 years from now?[00:54:33] Preston Pysh: What, \nwhen do you think that we,  that things start kind of hitting a critical \nmass time-wise, and then like what does that  just describe this world to us that, that you, \nthat you envisioned like five years from now?[00:54:46] André Neves: Yeah. It’s \nfunny because I’ve been living in a  lightning monetized enabled world for many years.[00:54:52] André Neves: I use \nlightning every single day,  hundreds of times. And some folks \nsee that as weird because, wait,  you make hundreds of payments like every day? \nThat sounds cumbersome. I said, no, that’s  because you’re thinking credit card payments. \nYou’re thinking cumbersome payments, you’re,  you’re not saying click a button and the payment \nhas gone globally to the other side of the world.[00:55:08] André Neves: Right? And so I have been \nliving in this world for like four plus years now,  and I would say that every year that \ngoes by, it gets to the point where  it’s much easier to sell, to talk, and \nto introduce this technology to everyone.[00:55:23] André Neves: When I used to talk \nabout Bitcoin and Lightning four years ago,  it was, you know, who are you?[00:55:27] André Neves: You’re kind of weird. Now \nit’s, oh yeah, I’ve heard of this. And some folks  even come to me saying, Hey, I read a book about \nlightning. That’s very interesting that you’ve  been doing this for four years. So in the five \nyear cycle, I would love to say that Bitcoin  is omnipresent, right? It’s everywhere. Everyone \nhas Bitcoin, and I really do believe that that’s  going to be the case in the next five to 10. \nAnd I believe that’s something as crucial as  a discovery layer, communications layer, like \nNostr can enable that to catapult and to really  hit that inflection point. Because I go back to \nthe point, you have a wallet of a Bitcoin wallet.[00:56:03] André Neves: I have a Bitcoin \nwallet. It is not easy for you and I to  interact and transact. But if you have a \nNostr client with a wallet attached to it,  now I can send you money the same way \nthat I send you messages or any emails,  right? So this is something that is very powerful.[00:56:17] André Neves: I think in the five years,  I would love to say that Nostr has a very \nactive, multi multimillion user active base.[00:56:25] André Neves: And I actually believe \nthat Nostr will become many digital economies  in and of themselves because folks will \ninteract on music, on art, on gaming,  on social experiences. And so folks \nwill be earning, they will be selling,  they will be buying, they will be trading. \nEverything will be happening in that sphere.[00:56:44] André Neves: I would love to \nsay that at the five to 10 year mark,  everyone has Bitcoin and everyone has no \ntheir clients. It remains to be seen. I think  it’s definitely a challenge in and of itself. \nNetwork effects have to play out and you know,  standards are hard to just grow. But \nas someone who has both human resources  with the company of 70 plus people, \ncapital resources, with our fundraising.[00:57:05] André Neves: The right mindset \nand the right engineers. I really feel like  we could make a dent and make an impact \nin pushing this forward. And our goal  is to make Bitcoin approachable, \neasy. Cool. Something that anyone,  whether you’re Joe Schmid down the street, \nwhether you’re Ed Smith from the corner,  like you can get started with Bitcoin and \nthen you can go down your own journey.[00:57:23] André Neves: If you want to learn \nabout self custody, yes, you should do that.  Let’s go for it. If you want to learn about \nrunning your own servers, let’s go for that.  But it needs to be easy. If it’s not easy and \nabstracted away, folks will not interact with it.  So it’ll be everywhere. And I, I think I’m betting \neverything on the fact that it’ll be everywhere.[00:57:40] André Neves: My entire life is \nBitcoin and now it’s very much Nostr as well. So  it’s great to be at the forefront \npioneering these, these technologies.[00:57:48] Preston Pysh: So as you were talking, I \nwent to Damus, which is Nostr. Yeah, I just typed  in your name and I clicked on the little lightning \nbolt where it was right next to your name.[00:57:59] Preston Pysh: Oh. And I got a \nthousand sat here. Right. I’m going to send  and just to kind of demo for people, \nI just sent you a thousand sat,  you didn’t tell me your, you didn’t \ntell me your bank address. You didn’t  tell me anything. I don’t know where \nyou’re at in the world right now.[00:58:13] André Neves: There \nwe go. I just received money.[00:58:15] Preston Pysh: And there you go.[00:58:16] Preston Pysh: You just \ngot the thousand SATs that I just  sent you and we did not have to tell \neach other anything. Nothing. Nothing.[00:58:25] Preston Pysh: And \nI just sent you 27 cents.[00:58:28] André Neves: And I don’t \neven know where you are in the world.[00:58:29] Preston Pysh: Big spender.[00:58:29] André Neves: Yeah. I, I, in my \ntalk, I mentioned this, I zap in my talk  I zap Jack Dorsey 5,000 sets, I stop and then \nI say, I don’t know where he is in the world.[00:58:39] André Neves: I don’t know what \nwallet he’s using. I don’t know what an  client he’s using. I know nothing. The only \nthing I know is one single identifier and I  can send you money globally. I think it’s just the \nbeginning of a very disruptive set of years for,  for social media, for communications online, \nfor monetization schemes. I really think,  you know, folks monetizing their content online \nthrough Nostr is going to change the landscape.[00:59:03] Preston Pysh: Wow. Super impressive. \nThe talk is, to you and this was a real honor for  me just to be able to have this conversation \nand I’m just thoroughly impressed with-[00:59:15] André Neves: Thank you.[00:59:15] Preston Pysh: People talk \nabout builders in the space. You, sir,  are one hell of a builder and this \nwas a real pleasure to talk to you.[00:59:22] André Neves: No, thanks \nPreston. Again, it’s an honor to be here.  It it was great to chat at at the in Orlando \nconference. I’m glad we got the chance to  connect here further and, and explore more of \nthese ideas. I look forward to the next one.[00:59:32] André Neves: I’m sure \nwe’re going to be chatting a lot more.[00:59:34] Preston Pysh: Yes, for sure. \nWe’ll have links in the show notes to  everything that André mentioned during the \nshow. Anything else you want to highlight,  André? We’ll also have your, your Twitter \nprofile, your Nostr profile there.[00:59:45] André Neves: There \nyou go. I was going to say.[00:59:47] Preston Pysh: We can send \nyou a thousand sats too if they want.[00:59:49] André Neves: Hey I was going \nto say if if folks want to get involved,  let’s go to ZBD.Gg for the app and for those \nbuilders that want to build with Bitcoin,  with naster, go to zebedee.Io for your API keys.  It’s free for everyone to get started, so \nwe’re open and we’re here to help you grow.[01:00:06] Preston Pysh: I love \nit. Alright, André. Thank you sir.[01:00:08] André Neves: No, thanks \nPreston, this was, it was an honor.  Thank you so much. I look forward to \nit. I’m going to tell all my friends,  they all follow your show and so I’m like, \nhey, I’m going to be on that show now. So",
