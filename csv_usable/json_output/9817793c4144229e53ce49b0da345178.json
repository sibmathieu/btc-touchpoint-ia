bitcoincoreelectrum blue wallet spectre walletsparrow wallet wasabi walland a ton of others it's also great forsomething called multi-sigwhich as you're uh going through yourbitcoin journey you'll learnis a step above when securingyour bitcoin so be sure to check theseguys out link down below for referencei'm usingthe cobo vault pro with the fingerprintscanner and the rechargeable batteryand finally i'm all in on bitcoin i earnmy income on bitcoin i live on bitcoinand one of the ways i'm able to do sois through bitrefill.comthis you can use bitcoin uh and you canuse the lightning network to buygift cards for pretty much anywhere it'sinsanehow much stuff you can buy with bitcoinonthis website and the best part about itisas you're shopping you're actuallyearning rewards in the form ofbitcoin so you're getting bitcoin backor sats backas you purchase be sure to head over tobitfreerefill.com to check them outthey've also got a great referralprogramlink down below and with that let's diveinto the listso item number one is to start learningabout the why and the how of bitcoinparticularly what sets bitcoin apartfrom regular day-to-day fiat currenciesor government issued currenciesand what also sets bitcoin apartfrom other cryptocurrencies known asaltcoinsit's very easy to dive into the spaceand see bitcoinget a little bit of sticker shockbecause the price is relativelyhigh and then start looking atalternatives thinking well maybe i'llmake more moneyinvesting in something else maybe i'llbuy something that lookscheap however bitcoin has been on topsince its inception despite the creationof thousands of other cryptocurrenciesfor a reason so i think you owe it toyourselfto get a deep understanding of why thatisbefore ever entertaining the idea oflooking atsomething else so i'm going to refer toyou to a few different materials to helpbuild on your learning now this is thefirststep in my five points for this videobut this can be done as you startgetting your feet wet with some of theothermore hands-on stuff so this is kind oflike a continuededucation throughout your bitcoinjourney so the first thing i'm going topoint out hereis kind of the the gold standard orthe bitcoin standard of books when itcomes to this spaceaptly named the bitcoin standard bysavine amuseand this one goes back through thehistoryof money it talks about centralizedbanking andkind of the uh these the gold standardand its failures and why it is no longeraround todayand how bitcoin improves upon that andcould be a replacement for the goldstandardand uh it goes into a lot of theincentive mechanisms of money itself andhow thechange of bitcoin is such a profound oneall aroundexcellent book i've got my copy righthere be sureto check that one out the other one iwould like to point you tofor another great book to read and orlisten to i think both of these areavailable on audio nowis called magic internet money a bookabout bitcoinby jesse berger now i interviewed jesseberger onmy show a while back great guyexcellent book and it's very bite-sizedall the little bits of information thechapters are very very compacthe is excellent at taking complex topicsand really whittling them down tothe bare minimum amount of knowledgethat you need to know to have a generalgrasp on everythingi found myself throughout the bookfinding pointswhere i would go oh there's that thingthat i take 20 minutes to describesummed up in a paragraph very conciselysodefinitely again i've got my copy herecheck out jesse burger's bookand just kind of go through it and takeyour time andit will give you a much betterunderstanding than the average personhas about bitcoinby far now i have made a couple videoson the the why of bitcoin and the how ofbitcoin as welland so there's one that i will link downbelow it is called bitcoin versusaltcoinswhy does bitcoin still dominate and itgoes througha number of the points that i thinkbitcoin hasum what is why it is trying to achievecertain thingsand how it is able to achieve thosethings and why it stands out apart fromthe restin those categories so be sure to checkthat out andsecondly i'm going to link to anothervideo i madethat is called should you buy altcoinsand this one actually goes through thenumbersum of the perspective of somebody thatkind of midbull market last time in 2017 would havecome inand seen some mainstream news coverageabout how to well diversifyyour cryptocurrency portfolio and whatwould have happened had you takena sum of money say ten thousand dollarsand spread it out across these veryvarious cryptocurrencies instead of justholdingbitcoin and spoiler alert it wouldn'thave been great you would have been muchbetter off in bitcoin but if you want tosee those actual numbersgo and check out this video that i didin november of 2020 and uhyou know numbers would have changed alittle bit since thenbut the general concept remains and heymaybe i'll doan update video to that uh closer to theend of 2021up next i highly recommend you guyscheck outbitcoin tv you can find iton uh youtube uh it's also known as theswansignal a bitcoin channel uh but it'sbasically24 7 streaming bitcoin contentfrom in my opinion all of the bestthinkers in the spaceincredible guests um and economistspeople coming onand understanding the implications ofbitcoin there's just a non-stop streamanda lot of that stuff that you'll see onthere will turn youon to other content creators where youcanfind out even more and finallyi would like to recommend bitcoinaudiblethis is a guy who takes all of the bestbitcoin content out therewritten content and makes it audiblehe he narrates every article every majorbitcoin piece of writing that you couldpossibly findcan be found on bitcoin audible and whenyou dive down this rabbit hole you willbe in for a treat becausehe's just excellent at what is what hedoes guy swan is justa legend in the space and he's doing usall a great service by putting thistogetherso i highly recommend checking that outsogo ahead go forth and continue yourbitcoin education journeyas you move into some of these nextsteps which are going to be a bit morepracticaland hands-onnow the first practical thing you'regoing to need to learn how to doand that's why this is point number twoafter educating yourself on bitcoinis to find an exchange where you canpurchase bitcoinnow this can vary depending on wherein the world you live so here in canadaa couple that come to mindfor myself that i use regularly areshake payand bull bitcoin these aretwo easy ones that are very simple towithdrawmy funds to my own custody i'm notleaving it with themnow in the u.s a few that come to mindare swan bitcoin again very easy topurchase and withdraw to your owncustodyand cash app which seems to be usedquite a bit in the usin the uk a good one that i've heard ofis coin floorand in australia another great one isambernow if you are locally in canada hereand you're dealing with cashand you want to be able to go to aphysical location then you can check outa company like bitcoin well that hasbitcoin atms aroundwestern canada if you're notspecifically in western canada andyou're moreglobal then you can head over to coinatm radar dot comand that will find any local bitcoinatms near youas well as the pricing there any feesthat you may be paying at those atmsnow if you're looking for a moredecentralized solution what i mean bythat is more kind ofpeer-to-peer not necessarily goingthrough a company but just going throughindividuals then you can check outbisque i've done a tutorial on thisalong with a few others that i'vementioned so farand paxful which is a little bit morecentralized than bisque but you're stillable to interact with individualspeer-to-peer and paxful steps in as kindof the arbiterin between in case anything goes wrongall of these solutions can vary as isaid depending onwhere you are on the globe so it's goingto take a little bit of googling tofigure outwhat is best for you or alternativelyyou can follow me on twitterat btc sessions and just sayhey ben what is good in my country and iwill put the word out tobitcoin twitter and see what they comeup withnow when you are finding an exchange youwant to make sure of a couple thingsnumber oneis that you need to be able to withdrawfunds off of that exchangeinto your own custody right now withsolutions likepaypal and robinhood sotrading solutions online they do notcurrently at the time of recording thisvideo allow you to withdraw bitcoininto your own custody you are forced tohavethem hold it which means you are verylimited in how you actually use bitcoinin fact you aren't using ityou're only speculating on it now on topof wanting to be able to withdraw toyour own custodyyou want to also maybe find a placewhereyou're not coaxed intotrading and what i mean is you'll get onsome exchangesand they'll be constantly poking andprodding you to check out new coins andtry and trade and try and gain a profitby goingback and forth between coins the problemwith that isyou're being coached into gamblingholding bitcoin versus speculating onall coins is an entirely differentbeast and in the long term betweencapital gainsmistakes made when trading and justreally not being super familiar with thespaceit's probably not in your best interestto be rolling the diceat these altcoin casinos so if you landon an exchangeand you notice that they're constantlytrying to get you to tradethey're trying to get fees out of you indoing so and they may not have your bestinterests at heart so i would lookelsewhere to purchase my bitcoinhopefully that will help get you startedfinding a good place to buy bitcoin foryourselfstep number three you're gonna need tofind yourself a goodbitcoin wallet so a bitcoin wallet is apiece ofsoftware in which sits the keys thatallow you to unlock and move your moneylet's make a little comparison herebetween the way bitcoin worksversus how the traditional financialsystem or the bankingsystem works so a bank can hold money onbehalf ofothers and the bank has full control ofthat money unless you withdraw it in theform ofcash and hold it yourself the same of istrue of a bitcoin exchangethey hold the keys to your digital moneyuntil you withdraw it into your ownwalletwhich can be any piece of software thatyou like to do thatwith uh so i'm going to give you acouple examples ofwallets that i would highly recommendone of them is calledblue wallet it is very simple it'savailable for android and iphoneand the the basic functions are thereand easy to use while there are stillsome advanced functions that you mayneed down the road that aren't shoved inyour face to confuse you right off thebatso i highly recommend checking out bluewalletand i have a full tutorial on that whichi will link down belowanother great alternative to blue walletisblockstream green or green wallet againyou can find this for bothandroid and iphone very simple to use onitsbasic kind of startup butthere are some advanced features thatare available to you therethat should you need them down the linewill be available to youagain i will have a tutorial to thislinked down belowbut there you go that's all you need hopover to the app store download either ofthese and get started with the tutorialsthat i've providednow there's one other thing to note onthe walletfront here a regular bitcoin walletis best used if you're not going to bedoinga lot of transactions and what i mean isdoing a lot of day-to-day purchasessending back and forth because thebitcoin network is limited in itscapacityfor the number of transactions it can doper secondand if it gets busy then the fees thatyou payfor those transactions can fluctuateup and down if you are looking to doa lot of transactions quite regularlyforperhaps smaller amounts then you mightwant to look into getting alightning wallet a bitcoin lightningwallet and this allows you to doinstant and nearly free transactions youcan kind of think of it as a regularbitcoin wallet being yoursavings account and a lightning walletbeing your checking account where you doyour day-to-day thingswhere you're going to be doing morehigh-volume regular transactionsso i will include a link to breezewallet which is a lightningneck network wallet it's important tonote that blue wallet that i mentionedbeforealso does have the functionality to addalightning network wallet to it and it isexplainedin full in the tutorial links down belowas wellfor step number four once you'veaccumulateda meaningful amount of bitcoin which canvary for each individual personyou're going to want to look into propersecuritywhich includes using a device known as ahardwarewallet now previously when we weretalking about bitcoin wallets i let youknow that a bitcoin wallet housesthe keys to your money which allows youto unlock your money and move itwherever you pleasewith a hardware wallet it takes it astep further and it takes the keys toyour moneyit removes them from being on your phoneor any other internet connected deviceand keeps them safely offline in aspecialized security device so we'regoing to look at a few different optionsbut all you really need to know here isyour keys are safeand offline when using a hardware walletwhereaswhen you're using a wallet on your phoneyou don't want to keep too much money onthata good threshold is thinking how muchcash would i be comfortable carryingaround with me day to day and then kindof go with thatso first up we have the ledger nowledger has a couple different devices ithas the older ledger nano s and it hasthe newerledger nano x the s is always pluggedin to a computer or a mobile devicewhereas thex is uh has the option of beingused with bluetooth with your mobiledevice bothwork just fine i have used both andcontinue to do soso be sure to check them out they areone of the earliest hardware walletsthatactually existed in the space as well asthe trezor this is also an early entrantinto the hardware wallet space they'vebeen around for quite some timepretty easy to operate pretty basic tooperate umand again a mainstay of the space forquite some timenow a step above this would bethe kobo vault and the reason i say thatiswith the ledger and the trezor typicallythe way you use them is you plug theminto something that is connected to theinternet sofeasibly there's the worry ofwell i'm i'm connecting it to somethingthat's connected to the internet so youmight have a worry therewhereas the cobra vault is air-gappedmeaning it doesn't plug intoanything that is connected to theinternet as i said beforekeys are held safe and entirelyoffline now if theuse of qr codes and going back and forthbetween your phoneand another device like this seems alittle bit complex then maybe you wantto go with a couple of the earlieroptionsbut either way this is a good option ifind it prettyeasy to use once you've done it a coupletimes and finallythere is the cold card wallet now thisalso doesair gapping albeit a little bitdifferently than the cobo vaultit is an excellent security deviceit does take a little bit more of alearning curvebut uh you know it's really up to theindividualthere's definitely some cypherpunkinfluences hereuh but i really do love everything thatcold card and coincoit doesso if you're up for a challenge be sureto check them outeither way whatever you're looking atwhatever device piques your interesti have full tutorials for every singleone of thesein the show notes down below i've alsoput together a playlistof of kind of everything hardwarerelated andsecurity related so once you get to thisstagein your bitcoin journey be sure to checkthat out andby watching that material you'll be ableto decide hopefullywhat is best for younumber five keep good backupsand check them regularly when you'recreating your first bitcoin walletwhether it be on your phonelike with the blue wallet example i gaveorwith any of the hardware options that wejust discussedtypically what you will get is a list of12to 24 words that you're meant to writedown and keepsafe this is the equivalent ofcreating a copy of a key to your houseexcept for it's for your moneyas with a house key and a duplicate hostkey anybodyholding that key can gain access to whatit unlocksin this case your bitcoin and sothat's why you want to keep these thingssafe in the event thatyou delete the app from your phone youcan re-access your funds with the wordsthat you've written down and kept safesomewhereif you accidentally smash your hardwarewallet or somebody steals ityou can re-access your funds with thosebackup words that you have stored safelynow you can do this as i said writing itdown on paperand keeping it somewhere safe typicallythe best betis to keep it in a different locationthan the actual hardware device itselfor your actual phonebecause in the event of something like afire well if you lose both the deviceand the backup of it you're kind of outof luck and that money is gone forevernow if you want to take this a stepfurther you cantake your backup to any of your walletsand back it up in something likesolid steel like with the bill foddlehere this is over on a website calledprivacy pros dot ioand what it is is it's a solid piece ofsteel with little tiles withvarying letters that you slide in torepresent the words that you wouldnormallywrite down to back up your wallet and sowhat this does is ittakes away the worry of fire damage orwater damage or even just accidentallythrowing it out because it's a piece ofpaper and you might not realize it'simportantyou're much less likely to do that witha solid piece of steelso when backing up your wallets pleasedo be carefulmake sure you don't take digital imagesofyour backup words because again phonescan be hacked computers can be hackedit's better to have thisphysical only not written down alsoit is good to check your backupsregularlyif you're dealing with a wallet on yourphone and you've written your backupdownor put it in steel it's a good idea tomaybe try on another phone andand import your wallet by typing inthose wordsor if you're dealing with hardwaredepending on the type of hardware youhavemost will have a feature in which youcancheck your backup in the settings andyou can actually inputyour backup words on the device itselfif you're dealing with hardware younever really want to input those wordsona phone or a computer because it kind ofundoes the security of keeping your keysofflinebut if you're doing it on the hardwaredevice itself the actual hardware walletthen those keys remain safe soas i said it's a good idea to keep yourbackupssafe away from the original device thatthey were created onso that you have that just in casesomething goes wrong with one the otheris still thereand keep it offline whether it be paperor steeldo not keep it online anywhereand in doing so you will be safe in thecase ofany sort of accident or emergencyfinally surprise entry number sixon this list is don't trustverify this is a phrase used regularlybybitcoiners and the whole basis ofbitcoin itselfis to not trust anybody at face valuebut rather to verify informationyourselfbitcoin goes on the assumption thatnobody should be trusted and itreaches that goal ofverifying themselves or each individualverifying themselves by runninga copy of the bitcoin ledgerthemselves thus verifying the supplyand the validity of every bitcointransactions the idea behind the entirenetwork that you shouldn't justinherently trust anyoneand the same applies for me if you'rewatching this video right nowyou shouldn't take anything that i havesaid at face value and just assume thati'm correctyou should go out try things learntest things and decide what is in yourbest interests and with that let's closeout thislist thank you guys so much for watchingof course if you're here on youtubeplease do
