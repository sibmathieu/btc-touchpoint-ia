looking forward to gettingmy hands on the broke issue made manygreat articles in there as well you canalso use the code VM live to save someSATs and now back to the interviewthanks guys what's up big Corners we'rereally excited for this interview uhprominent bitcoiner that needs nointroduction is the CEO and founder ofstrike Jack mallers Jack thanks for thetaking the time to talk to me today yowhat's up buddy how are you man thanksfor having me doing well thanks forcoming by we're looking forward totalking to you today so uh at the timeof recording this the news will bedropping so really looking forward tothis bear markets have traditionallybeen known for building uh and it seemsthat this bear Market is no different Iknow that notice taken note that you areless active on Twitter maybe you'recrushing a Noster I'm still not thereyet totally myselfI gotta hear your excuse for that butcontinueum my excuse is that I've just beenreally busy building on my own so butdefinitely someplace I got to get overI'd love to get welcomed by Jack DorseyI see that he's been thumbing up andhugging people as they enter in so it'son my to-do list maybe this week andI'll get over there but what's strikebuilding right now looking forward tohearing about thisuh we're building a lot of stuff we tryto always uh stay busy but uh the reasonI'm here and I'm really excited islaunching uh instant cheaper minces fromthe United States to the Philippines sowe partnered with pouch which I'll shoutout pouch shout out Ethan I love thoseguys and uh we're allowing strike usersto send instant cheap dollars receivedas Filipino pesos in a matter of secondsto phone number local bank account uhall the local payout methods in thePhilippines so it reallydisintermediating and uh revolutionizingthe way people experience cross-borderpayments hopefully yeah that's awesome Iknow a lot in the copy that you sent tous you were saying that it's one of thelargest remittance markets in the worldI think over 35 billion dollars flowsinto the Philippines every year and ofthat 12.7 billion I believe was comingfrom the United States alone soobviously uh it's very important andyou've talked about Ad nauseam about howthe lightning Network can disrupt theremittance payment industry make itcheaper faster safer uh there's manydifferent things anything you want toadd to thatno I mean it's just it's the craziestthing man like Bitcoin what people a lotof people don't appreciate maybe Bitcoinmagazine readers do but what I think thegeneral public doesn't appreciate is thefact that Bitcoin is a bearer physicalinstrument so like here's my Gatoradethis is a physical instrument I'm movingit around physically right it's goingthrough gravity as I move it so isBitcoin the bytes of data arerepresentative of a physical instrumentlike a bar of gold so now the fact thatnow do you think I'm strong enough to beable to throw this Gatorade bottle fromhere into the Philippines no I'm notunfortunately I'm 5A and I'm 150 poundshowever I am strong enough and so iseveryone in the world to be able to moveBitcoins from here to the Philippines orfrom the Philippines to Nigeria fromNigeria to Australia right and so it'sthe concept that you can actually settlephysical value instantly and at no costto the two independent parties that areconducting a financial service that's amind-blowing thing because a lot of thespeed uh deficiencies right like thedelays and the costs that are with swiftor with a Western Union are because ofcounterparty risk because of theintermediaries because of slowsettlement between two nation-governedcurrencies and so the fact that I canget something of physical value fromhere into the Philippines all we have todo is build a really good userexperience that here how many dollars doyou want get into the Philippines howmany Paces that are they going to getand then you've totally reinvented uhcross-word payments so it's I mean Inever get forward talking about thisstuff it's still I can't wrap my headaround it the fact that I can getsomething of physical value and Chuck itto the other side of the worldnever before have you had a physicalbare instrument that's digital so nowthe internet can escrow physical valuesunbelievableyeah and I mean we've seen countlessvideos along Twitter maybe soon to beNoster of people like paying for thingsand I know you're famous for the onevideo of paying uh one of your engineersyou were sitting in Chicago and he'ssitting in the UK and you just send themyou know money with you know norestrictions basically uh and I've evenseen a lot of people paying uh there wasthis one woman paying from Kenya intoNigeria and she paid for This Woman'slike cupcakes and it's just very coollike the uh interoperable open protocolbasically uh so I guess what do youthink the global impact could be on theadoption if it takes over the remittanceMarket I know you've kind of alreadyintegrated this with El Salvador in 2021with your announcement uh now you'regoing to the Philippines but just thebroader Strokes of what this can do forGlobal Bitcoin adoption and its use casewell I think first of all like what itcan do for Humanity Internationalpayments is a massive industry uh rightand so not only are you making it you'remaking it cheaper and you're making itfaster which is huge uh and by the wayit's not hard to sell uh for the recorduh sometimes Bitcoin in certainenvironments can be difficult to sell toa normie getting cheaper faster paymentsis not difficult to sell many of thetimes better exchange rates uh and alsoit's it's more accessible uh I couldsend a crossword pavement on strike tothe Philippines to the tune of a dollarum so it's more accessible it's cheaperit's faster it's safer uh and it's onthis open network so the economy is ascale the network effects that come withthat are super unprecedented so I thinkHumanity uh improving Internationaltransfer and having uh moreinterconnectivity financially with eachother that's a huge deal I mean we sawwhat happened when there was moreinterconnectivity with Communicationsover the Internet what the internet didfor communications I think Bitcoinlightning can do for monetary financialservices so I think we're in the earlyInnings like we're in layup lines ofwhat's eventually going to come from uhInternational cross-border payments anduh I mean what like for Bitcoin adoptionuh you know Bitcoin is uh is like acidwhatever it touch it it destroys andbelieves through Bitcoin is going to runits course uh no matter bull or bear nomatter what I do uh we hope to behelpful and I think you know Bitcoin canbe helpful uh to people in a variety ofways so we hope that we're deliveringvalue using Bitcoin as a paymentsNetwork to settle a value between us andpouchum but yeah yeah just another note inthe network I think that's a term thatyou've said in the past before I knowrecently you just tweeted out thatyou're integrating with Fiserv and uhClover Commerce so I know in 2022 a bigpoint of your talk was talking about youknow going after the point of sale inmerchant adoption uh how does thatintegrate or how do you see thatintegration not just with the sendglobally but now also integrating intothe merchant side of things if you cantalk more about that integration thatyou just sawI mean so like again back to theinternet I love the analogyuh does the internet does TCP know thedifference when I'm streaming a video onYouTube or I'm texting my ma or I'mgambling on an NBA game these are alljust internet requests uh and solightning doesn't know the differenceeither our API and a lot of the servicesand software we've built Pfizer isinterested in it people in thePhilippines are interested in it and CRis interested in it right it kind oflikeI think of the lightning Network as thevalue transfer protocol for planet Earthin the same way that the internetall-encompassing is uh thecommunications protocol for planet Earthwhether you're sending a text sending anemail watching a video playing a song uhyou're using the internet to communicateuh that message and I think forlightning whether you're buying a coffeewhether you're issuing payroll whetheryou're sending money home to thePhilippines you'll be using the world'svalue transfer protocol so that's how wesee it we think it's going todematerialize a lot of these independentbifurcated networks and so it's a reallycool property of our business is we getto serve a variety of customers all infinancial services with uh one Techstack yeah that's awesome I think youmake a big Point I've seen a lot of yourinterviews with mainstream media andsuch that obviously you're building outstrike and it's you know imperative toyou and your employees and yourcustomers that you're successful andthat you're still viable but you alwaysHammer home this point that it's likeyou're building on top of an openprotocol that is the lightning Networkand you make that point very clearyou're like strike's important I lovestrike but if we go away tomorrow thelightning Network and Bitcoin don'tdisappearum so I guess uh can you iterate that onthat or Hammer that point home againthat like you know there's Bitcointhere's a lightning Network and thenthere's the companies that come aroundit their companies are going to come andgo and we've kind of seen in 2022 a lotof companies come and go at timesyeah well you know it's pretty funny Idon't know of any lightning companies uhthat have gone maybe that speaks to uhthe integrity and the quality of thosethat focus on the right things I thinkuh I'll stick with the internet analogyas long as I'm keeping it simple uh howvaluable of a company would Google be ifthey were the only website on the webuh I'm no genius but they'd be worthfucking zero because there'd be noinformation on the web to index and so anetwork is only as strong as itsparticipants I got to be able to paysomeone else's invoice and someone's gotto be able to pay the invoices that Icreate and so the concept is that theopen network will dematerialize theclose bifurcated networks you cannotpossibly compete with that I have morepeople working on my network than PayPalhas on theirs and you think to yourselfwhat the fuck strike isn't even threeyears old yeah how is that possible wellthere's no strike Network it's theBitcoin and lightning Network there aremore people working on bitcoin thanthere are on PayPal and think about thatfor a second if Dan Schulman CEO ofPayPal said hey everyone that works atPayPal you need to take 365 days awayfrom the keyboard and go on a full yearvacation PayPal would not get any betteras a company if I were to tell strikeemployees we're not going to work onstrike for the next 365 days strikewould be better our products ourservices our company would be morevaluable in a year whether we're workingon it or not there's going to be morenodes on the network more pouches thatspring up all over the world more peopleintegrating into Point of Sales morewallets that could check out at ourpoint of sale Integrations so it's sucha powerful concept that idea of opennetwork effects and economies of scaleand Google dude Google's worth what atrillion fucking dollars they the thevalue to that business was built likewhat 30 years ago at this pointsomething like that 20 30 years ago theproduct hasn't changed what's changed isthe value of the internet and the denseVal or information that they're indexingon the web that's what's changed Googlehasn't really done of course there'sthere's Gmail and stuff but the abilityto index and search the web is theircore product and that hasn't changedwhat's changed is the size and the valueof the web itself and we try and operatethe same way is that I have I'm verybullish long tail on bitcoin andlightning I think the value of this openvalue transfer protocol for planet Earthis only going to grow and strike isgoing to hopefully play a minority partbut it's not a winner take most orwinner take all Market in fact the partof the thesis is that there's going tobe many many many winners indematerializing the biggest industry onplanet Earth which is paymentsyeah and I think that's a great analogyuh I guess tying that back into theinternet of things so obviously you knowin the late 90s A lot of people weretalking you just slapped a.com or yousaid that you're doing internet ofthings and you know you saw this crazyboom and run up in the stock market andall of that uh for everypets.com there'san Amazon a diamond in the roughobviously you and I believe Bitcoin isthat diamond in the rough and it's gonnaonly keep getting bigger and and betterbut where would you say if you'recomparing Bitcoin and the lightningNetwork to the internet adoption wheredo you say that we are do you thinkwe're in the late 90s and we just sawthe crash in 2022 do you think we'remore even earlier than that do you thinkwe're later than that do you thinkthat's probably a good analogy I'd loveyour thoughts on thatI don't know dude I get like you know ifyou want my thoughts I can give you mybest I for but um the way I think aboutit and I preach internally to thecompany is it's just focus on givingvalue todayum right like you know people speculateabout hyper bitcoinization or here's thechart of Amazon plot where you are Idon't fire noum but I do know that I can now send aninstant crossword payment from my USdollar account to the Philippines that'sincredible that's never been able to bedone before that's a jaw-droppingexperience because of this technology ohand then what am I going to do tomorrowlook to add another Market looked atanother country looked at another pointof sale provider look to whatever and souh I thinkum there was the children's book wherethe boy tells the horse I can't see overthe trees how are we gonna get out ofthe forest and the horse goes I can'teither we should probably just focus ontaking our next step and that's mythat's my take I don't know maybe I'lllive to see hybrid bitcoinization maybeI won't but I bet your damn ass I bet Icould change a lot of the world if Ijust focus on change you know controlwhat I control tomorrow oh yeah I don'tknow what do you thinkyeah I'm mean it's kind of speculationso I agree you know it's who am I todecide where we are I just know stayhumble stack SATs from my buddy MattOdell so that's just kind of what whatI'm sticking withum so I know you guys have had yoursetbacks and strike many Bitcoincompanies uh you know have madeweathered 2022 uh there's been somelayoffs that have come unfortunately uhBitcoin magazine was hit with that aswell I know your announcement from B22was talking about the integration of youknow buying Coke over tour with NCR andBlackhawk uh where are those at I'm justcurious I know that there's kind ofsetbacks what would the biggest setbackstechnical things was it more on thecompany side of things of like concernsabout Bitcoin I'd love your thoughts onall of thatuh all the above dude I mean like maybewhere'd you say your Bridge NorthCarolina I'd come have a whiskey withyou and I'll tell you insane stories butum no all the above but I think it'ssuper important like I wrote that blogpost that I own it man like I'm 28 yearsold now I found a strike I was 24 25um and I'm an idiot in many ways and Igot way too excitedum these companies a lot of thesebusinesses we're working with areFortune 100 Fortune 500 companies andit's super complicated and you mix alittle bit of a bear market and a SAMBinky bankman fraudster freed and uh andit gets it gets complicatedum and so I own it 100uh and uh I try to write that and I putmy hand up and you know I I hope that Imake plenty more mistakes even biggerthan that because I'm not going to stoptrying it to be the most ambitious guyin the room I love it um so uh justsaying that uh outright I think is superimportant is that there's no fingerpointing on my side at all I own it andthese things are really hard and reallychallenging but that's why we go afterthem so then speaking of that uh they'regoing well dude I mean learning whatI've learned now and what it takes toDethrone Visaum they're going really fucking well youknow if I could rewind time I'd do a fewthings differentlyum but we're there's NCR is superparticular on what I'm allowed to say soum we'rein a lot of their latest versions andwe're looking forward to uh you knowthey serve the biggest retailers in theworldum that's that's why they're thenational cash register so we're superexcited about keeping our head down anduh getting some Merchants live uh andand Blackhawk we should have our firstmerchant lives uh well within thiscorner quarter any week nowum you guys saw Clover uh and uh we'vegot some more stuff too but I've learnedmy fucking lesson man I'm not gonna openmy mouth so that that's what I don'tknow you can ask me whatever you wantbut that's kind of my blanket statementno no I think that's awesome I thinkthere's many mistakes along the wayhopefully people don't lose too manySATs with the mistakes they do make uhit happens to all of us I've been knockon wood I've been lucky to not lose anySATs I had a couple close calls withcertain things you know moving fundsfrom here to there and testing outthings breaking things but I guessthat's what it is when you're adoptingThis Global money and we're trying to uhbeat Central Bankers basically well whenyou're not busy like educating DavePortnoy and stuff like that the innerworkings of the bear market andbusinesses that have gone bust you knowwe don't need to name them here but youknow the laundry list of all those namesthat are in trouble or now no longerwith us uh what has been this uh spareMarket been like for you I know you'vebeen around at least 10 years in thisindustry so how does this stack up toother ones more optimistic you know morelike this is going to be a long bearMarket I know we don't need to speculateyou and I both don't know we could saythe price could go up price could godown it's gonna go complete oppositedirection of whatever we say but whatare your thoughts on this bear Marketcompared to other onesumso I think a few things one the longerBitcoin survives and is alive uh thebetter news right like bitcoin's notgoing away at this point first bearMarket I saw was gox I remember runningup to my dad's room being like is itover and he was like no uh fuck do yourhomework but I thought it was over andthere was good reason for that at thetime right Bitcoin was Tiny uh and now Ithink the more Bitcoin survives I meanI don't think there's there's not a soulon planet Earth that thinks bitcoin'sgoing away at this point so I think youEncompass that in a bear Marketum I don't know this is one of theeasier ones I've ever been throughum just at how far along Bitcoin is inits life cycle uh the one superinteresting thing I think is this is thefirst bear Market where it's also a bearmarket for the macro environment as wellthis is the first recession bitcoin'sbeen through so it's not just Bitcointhat's having a tough time I've neverI'll tell you this I've never beenthrough Bitcoin bear Market whereNetflix stock at one point wasperforming worse than Bitcoin that I'venever been through uh and so I don'tknow though I mean to be totally honestwith you as bitcoiners we're uh prettyseasoned uh and mentally and physicallyprepared uh for these type of marketsand I think Bitcoin it's never been amore validating time for Bitcoin toexist and be uh as strong as it is so Idon't know man I'm confident patient I'mstaying humble I'm stacking sacks but itis that's the one differentiator is uhFacebook stock is more of a shit coin uhthan any of these other thing so that'scrazyyeah and we get a lot of flack you knowfriends and family and whatnot beinglike yo bitcoin's down so much I'm likewell it's been worse and then on top ofthat all the other tech stocks areprobably doing even worse than Bitcoinso you know it's funny when they're likeoh bitcoin's down it's like well this isyou know this has happened four or fiveother times at leastum you will you know like sorry but youknow obviously like you know if someonegoes from zero dollars to Eleven Hundredthen down to 200 and then 20 000 andthen down three thousand seventythousand and then down to twentythousand and then obviously if you justplot the beginning to the end it's youknow who fucking cares if it takes it'sit's roller coaster there but I thinkthe really interesting part that I'msuper excited to watch is how Bitcoinreacts on the back half of thisrecession because if you go to 2008um assets that have some relative fixedquantity everything by the way betweengold to like soybeans like anything thathas a relative fixed quantity impliesthat it does not have a directoryrelationship with interest ratesand and it's a really important conceptand so Bitcoin has never been in thismarket so 2008 if you're gonnaartificially inflate the strength of thedollar which is what the FED doesum then there's no I don't care ifyou're the scarcest thing in the worldif you're a 101 Van Gogh painting likethe fed's going to impact you if they'rejust going to shock planet Earth withrates like this but on the back half ofit so a la 2010 2011 is where you startto saw gold and even soybeans anythingwith fixed quantity start to decoupleand really show off the fact that theydon't have a direct relationship withinterest rates so I'm super curiousabout that is that if you mark thisrecession what starting in 2022 wellrecession I don't know by whosedefinition but if you the downturn in 22and so 2008 2010 22 would map US 24 andI'm just right I'm just like Knack andmath and you you put a having in the mixthereum I'm pretty curious like everyone canmock Bitcoin now but mock whatever youwant everything is having a reaction tothe dollar right now it's artificiallystrength and there's nothing you coulddo about it it's part of the Fiat worldthat I was born into you don't blame mefor that but on the back half of itumman bitcoin's the most fixed quantityasset in the history of humanity it'sthe only asset that has a guaranteedfinite Supply everything elseum right you can always make more of ifyou have enough of an incense so I'msuper curious to see that the version of2010 that looks like it'll probably be2024.um we'll see yeah I I completely agreewith all of that so obviously we've seenBitcoin in the lightning Network youknow we've beaten the finance industryfuck whatever Jamie Diamond says it's apet rock or whatever I love it when hesays this but then he'll gladly sellcrypto you know permissory notes or justlike bash on bitcoin but then he'll sellhis high net worth clients Bitcoin butenough bashing on Jamie Diamondobviously we're you know beating theremittance network with a lot of helpthat you're doing with uh send globallyand we're also seeing integration intooil and gas companies we've seen youknow the shell announcement they'responsoring Bitcoin 2023 we're veryexcited to have shells a sponsor for ourconferenceum I guess what industries do you alsosee Bitcoin changing or you know uhinteracting with aside from the onesthat I just listeduh the ability to store and persistwealthum across obviously the market size ofpersisting wealth across time is peoplelisten like moving and transporting andselling value across space from here tothe Philippines that's awesome and we'resuper excited about it moving a milliondollars from the year 2023 to the year2043 is is huge too soum money is the most valuable Marketgood in human history uh in order tohave a functioning Society I think theuh scientific is over 200 people uh youneed a monetary instrument to solve TheCoincidence of wants and so theopportunity to improve Humanityoh oil Gas Energy paymentsumthe ability to store and persist wealthand fix the money fix the worldeverything yeah no I agree uh andobviously you've built your business onyou know strike and it's open networklike we've mentioned a few times in thisinterview uh I guess two other protocolsthat seem to be propping up or poppingup from it is Noster which we talkedabout earlier and then Taro what areyour thoughts on both of those protocolsand you know how will they persist doyou think they will die uh do you thinkit's just Bitcoin growing andpropagating through and trying to justmeet different Market needsyeah well Noster I don't know if it hasas much a correlation of Bitcoin assomething like Taroum but I'm a huge fan of all of it Ithink open networks are beautifulum open accessible networks uh aremagical and uh I love everything I'msaying I'm a huge fan of Nostra I'veI've said it a million times I thinkJack Dorsey is one of the greatestentrepreneurs in human history I thinkhe's my goat personally uh and so uh andeverything that uh I don't even know howto pronounce Fiat Joff how do I say andyeah Jeff yeah and and Zebedee and Andreand all of them like huge shout out andKudos it's been unbelievable to watchand uh I got uh I'm on Nasir and uh Ihang out there it's remarkable so I'm afan of open networks generally and yeahI mean as far as sorrow like listen likeagain uh the Network's only as strong asits participants soum I mean if Tara works that's amazingum right I'm pretty curious to kind oflike actually I'm curious about a fewparts and uh I'm I'm paying closeattention just to see how it actuallyworks out and pans out and actually uhhits the market but theoreticallyum it's open Network free marketcompetition by the best experience winsand uh you know with strike we don'treally have too much of a market bias wedon't care uh we're on Lightning we'rebullish lightning and we're gonna behere hopefully forever so yeah no Ithink I Echo your sentiments with JackDorsey I think he's one of the bestentrepreneurs if not the best of alltime you know even with stepping awayfrom Twitter and then now you know it'dbe very interesting to see I know he wasdoing a lot with like blue sky and justkind of using the open protocols to tryand beat I think it would be prettyawesome to build a you knowmulti-billion dollar company only toleave it and then build an even bettercompany uh in what he's working with andI know he's working on a lot ofdifferent things I guess my last thingis we're getting uh to time here and Idon't want to keep you too long I guessuh the lightning Networks great andthere's many things that are awesomeabout it but there are issues a lot oftimes with liquidity and and things likethat not to flood lightning Network Ilove it I use it all the time but Iguess one thing that I'm personallyinterested is Bolt 12 and theimprovements on that is there anyimprovements aside from Bolt 12 or maybebolt 12 that you're excited for thatpotentially are integrated intolightning like you said like if you guyswere to walk away from Strike and leavefor 365 days strikes business if youwere to come back tomorrow or you knowin a year from now would still be abetter company because of theimprovements on bitcoin and thelightning network uh what are yourthoughts thereum I'm a big uh bull 12 proponent Ithink it's unbelievable it retains a lotof the properties that make lightinghour extremely important uh accessible alot of privacy guarantees that are inboth 12. super super important I thinkin the long tail longevity of this thinguh though I commonly say internally youknow my kids hopefully which by the wayI don't have any uh are going to bescanning while you know our QR codes oneday so thinking with that timepreference in mind I think Bowl 12 ishuge and retains the properties thenetwork and allows us to get a lot ofadded benefits so bolt 12 is probablythe most exciting uh property that I amthen speaking on behalf of strike areexcited about that has a lot to do withour products and our vision and what uhwe're going to be working on over thenext decade So my answer would probablybe Bowl 12 for sure that's awesome allright jack now that we're at the end ofthe interview anything else you want toadd that I did not ask you or anythingthat just final messages you want toleave to the audience thanks for joiningus today by the way yeah dude thank youI I love uh you guys have been part ofmy career the whole time I love Bitcoinmagazineum you guys are the best uh no try tosend uh US dollars to the Philippinesreceived as a PHP it's cool as fuckum it doesn't feel real when you do itit feels like magic it's not it's alightning Network payment uh and uh giveit a try I think cross water paymentsone to two years from now are gonna lookentirely different um all because of thelightning Network and everyone that'sbuilding on top of it so uh we'reexcited and uh yeah I don't know I'llpost some Philippines charity or I'llfind something fun between now andTuesday for people to give it a try toall right sounds good thanks so muchJack we really appreciate your time onceagain this is Jack mallers the CEO ofstrike thanks Jack have a good oneeveryone peace much love brother peace[Music]foreign[Music]",
