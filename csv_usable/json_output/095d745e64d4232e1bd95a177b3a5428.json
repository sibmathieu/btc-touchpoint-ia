Sig file also to my downloads so ifI go to finder look in my downloads herewe can see all the files are ready to goI did download the seed signer twice soI'm just going to move this one to binand here we can see all three files areready to go now we need to look for theverification instructions so I'm goingto go to seed sinus GitHub over here andjust scroll down all the way until I seethis verifying that the downloaded filesare authentic before you do this youwill need gpg downloaded so if you openthis in a new tab you will need todownload this onto your computer in mycase I like to use gpg tools so justsearch gpg tools and it will be this gpgtools.org so once you go ahead anddownload The Suite from here by clickingdownload you will have this gpg keychainon your application so if I click onthis this will be my keychain which wewill use shortly so I'm going to go backto the verification instructions overhere and step one is to import the keyso what we're going to do is open ourterminal I like to just search terminalover here then we need to copy this linepaste it in our terminal and clickreturn and now it is requesting the keyand here we can see the keyword importedso if I go to my keychain we can see wenow have seed sinus key but now thiscould just be any random key we need tomake sure that it is actually seed signis key so to do this we're going to goto seed sign is Twitter which is just atseed signer and we're going to see ifthese Keys match so here on Twitter thekey engine07260119 and it does as well over here07260119 we can also look a bit furtherback to make sure we've got 882e and C7e F and if we look here we can seethose match we're going to take this onestep further and also look on theirTwitter on their key base I mean so herewe are in Key base I'm going to searchseed signerand it's this one at the top here we cansee we want to see China's key base andtheir key engine07260119 these Keys match you can takethose steps further if you wish andcheck other sources of information butthat's enough for me I I'm pretty sureI've got the correct key here okay sonow that we've verified we have theright key let's go back to their GitHubover here and look at the next step whatwe need to do next is verify the dot Sigfile so in my finder we need to verifythat this is authentic so to do thiswe're going to go back to the terminalI'm going to run a line called clearjust to get rid of all this mesh andhere we have a nice fresh terminal now Ineed to tell the computer to look intothis downwards folder so that it can seeall these files over here so I'm goingto run CD which means change directoryand I'm going to say downloads so thatthe computer looks into this downloadsfolder and here we can see we are nowlooking into the downloads folder nextall I need to do is run this line overhere so I'm just going to copy thatpaste it into my terminal click returnand we need to look out for goodsignature from and then the correct keyso as you can see here I've got goodsignature from seed signer and then weneed to ensure that this key matchesagain so let's open our keychain andhere we can see again it ends in0726.0726 and 0119 which is the correctKey by the way we can safely ignore thiswarning message over here we can justdisregard that and move on to the nextstepso I'm going to scroll down to the nextstep and here it is step two verifyingthe software image binaries are genuineso all we have to do is again copy thisline then we paste it into our terminalclick return and what it says here is weneed to look for our file nameand then okay at the end so if we lookat my terminal this is the name of thesoftware I downloaded and we've got anok so we know the software we havedownloaded is authentic okay so now inmy downwards we know that this softwareI have downloaded is authentic so I cango ahead and delete these two files hereall I need is this my SD card is nowplugged in and now we need to actuallyflash this seed signer software onto ourSD card so to do this we're just goingto scroll down to the Lena etch overhere we will need this software on ourcomputer so I'm going to open this linkin a new tab over hereand I'm just going to download etcherfor whatever operating system I'm on soI am on Mac OS so I'm going to click ondownload over here and there we can seebellina etcher is now downloading ontomy computer but you know etcher is fullydownloaded so I'm just going to run thisfile over here and drag this to myapplications I'm going to quickly fillin my passwordI filled in my password and now Belinaetcher has been added to my applicationso if I open my applications here at thetop we will see I have etcher so I'mgoing to run this application now it'sgoing to say this is downloaded from theinternet are you sure you want to openit I'm going to open it anyway and herewe have bellina etcher up and runningBallina Echo is not working on myYouTube Mac account so I quicklyswitched to my main administratoraccount okay here I am on my main Macaccount let's try this again I'm goingto click Flash from file then select theseed signer downloadnow I'm going to select the SD card asmy Target and then click Flash and thenit says bolina etcher would like toaccess files on a removable volume I'mgoing to select ok to allow it to goahead and do the Flash and there we goit says flash completed meaning that mySD card now has the seed signer softwareon it now we can go ahead and actuallybuild the device before we start thebuild let me first mention that C10 isfully air gapped meaning that there'snever a need to connect to Wi-Fi or plugthe device into a computer however myRaspberry Pi board does have Wi-Ficapabilities to ensure that it is neverable to connect to Wi-Fi I'm going toremove apart from the board to read moreabout removing this and how it works Iwill leave a link below showing theresearch done by DT and you can seeseedsana verifies that it worksthemselves on Twitter I will also leavea link below so this little part thatI'm pointing at right there needs tocome off to remove the Wi-Fi capabilityso I'm going to try to do this with sometweezers I don't have pliers solet's give this a goand there we gowe got the part off there so you willnotice now that the piece that was overhereis now gone so that should have removedthe Wi-Fi capability what we're going todo now is a quick pre-assembly withoutputting the parts in this case just sowe can make sure everything isoperational so first we want to grab ourRaspberry Pi board and take a look onthis side here we need to open thislittlebar over herejust like that nice and gently so wedon't rip it right off there we can seeit is now open and then we're going toslide our camerainto the bar there so in my case theRaspberry Pi board is facing up and weneed the brown part to face up as wellso I'm going to slide this camera injust like that and now I'm going toclose the seal by applying pressure onboth sidesand there we go the camera has beenclosed into the board there next we needto attach our screen so what I'm goingto do is align these pins on the boardwith the screen over herejust like this and then just apply alittle bit of pressureso that we can push the componentstogether just like that there so thatboard is now in and we can see if we putthe camera like this it will be facingaway from the board so that when it's inthe caseit will be pointing out at the bottomherecool so this seed Sounder should befully operational now we just need toput in our SD card so I'm going to slidethat into the SD card slot on the sideover here and we're going to power thisthing up okay here I have my power cableand at the top is our Port so I'm goingtoput the power cable in just like thatand now we need to give the seed sign a30 to 50 seconds just to boot up therewe go the C Channel logo has appearedwhich is a good sign we just need towait for it to open the home screen andthere we go we're in the home screen soeverything looks good so far we're justgoing to open our settings quickto select an option you need to pushthis button inward so I'm going to pushthat in and we need to scroll down to io test and then click in again and nowwe can just test that all our buttonsand components here are working so firstwe need to push left and we can see itit respondsright Works bottom Works top works nowI'm going to push this button in on theleftand that works now key one will open ourcamera so let's see if that camera worksthere we go it managed to capture animage so that works key two will be toclear the image so let me click key twothe image cleared and finally Q3 is toexitand that worked so the seed signer seemsto be fully operational we're going togo ahead now and throw it in one ofthese cases first I have to disassembleit before we can put it in the case soI'm going to remove the SD card and thepower therenow we're going to gently remove this wedon't want to break any pinsso I go side by side slowly there we gothen we're going toget loosen the seal upand the camera should slide right outjust like thatand there we go now we can go ahead andactually assemble this thing in one ofthese cases over here so I think theblack one looks pretty cool we're goingto put it in the black case and thefirst thing we need to do again is justto attach this camera so again we needto just loosen this bar herejust like that and then we're going toinsert the camera with the brown portionfacing up with the board facing up sothere we can see the back has a bit of agolden color we need the brown facing upat the board so that when it's insertedand we flip this around the camera facesaway from the board so let's go aheadand slide this in just like thatand then I'm going to seal this so thecamera is in nice and tight and there wego that has been sealed now it's time toput this Raspberry Pi and camera intothe case so first we want to find outwhich way to put it and we can do thatby looking at these parts here so we'vegot three parts over here and theRaspberry Pi has these three ports hereso we need to make sure these line upjust like that so we're going to insertthe board this way first we need to putour camera in soI'm going to be using a bit of prestik Idon't know I think it's called a bluetack in other countries but in SouthAfrica we call this prestik and I'mgoing to just put itright here to hold the camera in placejust like thatnow I'm going to again make sure thislines up with the ports then I'm goingto fold the camera like thisline it up with the hole like that andthen press down on the Press stick so itsticks into placeso I have stuck that camera into placeand now I need to slide this board in sowe need to do this at an anglejust like thisand then push down to get that intoplaceand you'll hear a few clicks tothat will tell you it's in good so yeahthat looks to be good to me let's take alook at these ports those look likethey're in place and the SD card Portalso looks good so our Raspberry Piboard is in successfullyand the camera looks good as well it isa bit uneven but that's fine with menext we're going to attach our screen soagain we line the pins up with the boardsolet me line that up just like thatand now we just need to apply pressureso that the two componentsjoin each otherand there we goour screen is now attached andall our ports look goodand our seed sign is ready to go let'sput in the SD card and boot this thingup here is my SD card now one thing youdon't want to do is by mistake lose thisSD card in the board you want to makesure it's in the slot there so rarelyline that uplike that and then insert that becauseif you lose this SD card in here it'squite a mission to get that out you haveto disassemble the whole board so nowthat our board is ready and we have theSD card in let's go ahead and power thisthing on I'm going to put the powercable back in the top leftand we're going to give it 30 to 50seconds to boot upand there we go our seed signer hasbooted upwould give it a few more seconds to goto the home screenand here we are at the home screen sonow we're going to quickly do anothertest just to make sure nothing brokewhile we were setting this thing up I'mgoing to go back to settings then scrolldown to i o test then test all thecomponents so left works right Worksbottom Works top works now I'm going topush this in that's working good let'sgive the camera a test I'm going toclick on thisand there we go we can see it has takena photo of the wood here Q2 should clearthis and then key 3 to exitand yep everything looks operationalafter setting up my seat Center I didnotice that the camera is actuallyupside down so if I open a chair we cansee it says hello but the camera readsit upside down so to fix this we can goover to our settingsthen we need to click on Advanced thenwe need to scroll all the way down untilwe see this here camera rotation so I'mgoing to click on that and rotate thecamera180 degrees now we want to make surethis setting saves so I'm going to exitAdvanced over here and then here I am inthe settings screen again and I'm goingto click on this persistent settings andI'm going to enable this so that itstores my settings in my SD card overhere so I'm going to enable thatnow exit my settings again and if weopen our camerawe can see it nowreads it in the correct waycool so that is how to build a seedsigner and in my next few videos I'llshow you how to actually use the thingwith wallet slack Sparrow wallet andblue wallet and so on",
