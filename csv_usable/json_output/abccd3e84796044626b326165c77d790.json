  "text": "[Question] Do you run your own node? I \nwonder if you run your own nodes and,  if you do, do you have a particular \npreference for its configuration?  [Answer] That's a great question, Antonio. Yes I \ndo. I've run a node since the very first moment I  got involved in bitcoin. My first interaction \nwas with a full node and I've been running  a full node since. In fact, for a variety of \nreasons I actually run several full nodes. Some  of them are pruned, as they call them, which \nmeans that those don't have a full historical  copy of the blockchain because those nodes are \nused to do validation of current transactions,  for example in an e-commerce environment. But \nI also do keep fully archival nodes that have  every single transaction from the genesis block \nand a full transaction index, and on top of that,  a full UTXO database that I use an electrum public \nserver to run, so that i can interact with my own  wallets, and also interact with programmatically. \nWhen I need to do some kind of analysis of the  blockchain, or look at a specific transaction, \netc, i always use my own authoritative  full node that I've configured myself. \nThe configuration really isn't very  different from the defaults. The defaults \nactually work really well for most people.  I either use a cookie authentication mechanism \nor a much much stronger password than you might  anticipate for the RPC interfaces so I can ensure \nthat those systems are secure. I also use some  basic packet filtering and port filtering to \nensure that my node is only accessible on its  RPC interface from the correct places. But other \nthan that not much different. And, of course, all  of my nodes are available both on IP as well as on \nTOR, the onion routed network. And they they serve  gigabytes of data out to nodes that are \nbootstrapping or wallets that are trying to  gain access to the bitcoin blockchain. At the last \nestimate, because of the number of nodes I run and  because of the amount of bandwidth I serve, it \ncosts anywhere from three to five hundred dollars  a month in bandwidth costs and such. I run nodes \nboth on popular cloud systems, like amazon cloud,  as well as on dedicated privately \nowned computers on their own dedicated  systems and internet connections. Thanks \nfor watching.
